After opening 2024 at a split-adjusted $49.24, NVDA stock has ripped to around $128 per share a week before the next quarterly earnings announcement a whopping 160% gain from January. Meta Platforms (META) is the second-largest gainer in the MAG 7, up over 50% on the year.But the focus is on Nvidia, which is expected to announce a earnings per share (EPS) of $0.64 on $28.64 billion in revenue. Both figures are higher than last quarter, and Nvidia has exceeded EPS and revenue estimates four quarters in a row.Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, offered strong positive sentiment for last quarter's results and the future of the company: \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCompanies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center\u2014AI factories\u2014to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"He went on to say that \u201dAI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.\"While the drum keeps beating for NVDA stock\u2014even through the recent market volatility early in August\u2014the company has legit competitors on their trail.NVIDIA's competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) recently announced plans to acquire ZT Systems, a leading provider of AI infrastructure, prompting NVDA to say this: \"The strategic transaction marks the next major step in AMD\u2019s AI strategy to deliver leadership AI training and inferencing solutions based on innovating across silicon, software and systems. ZT Systems\u2019 extensive experience designing and optimizing cloud computing solutions will also help cloud and enterprise customers significantly accelerate the deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale.\u201dAMD has agreed to acquire ZT Systems in a cash and stock transaction valued at $4.9 billion, inclusive of a contingent payment of up to $400 million based on certain post-closing milestones. AMD expects the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis by the end of 2025.\"This is a big move for AMD, and this naturally puts pressure on Nvidia to keep performance sky high if they intend to maintain the stranglehold they have on the sector as of now.Looking to the options market can help us put context around expected stock price moves for earnings reports. Implied volatility gives us an idea of what range we can expect for the stock price after adjusting for time to expiration for the options contracts.Through next week, NVDA stock has a +/- $14.00 stock price expected range. Given that the stock currently sits around $128 per share, the range exceeds 10% of the current notional value of the stock. This is on the higher-end of the range for earnings expected moves, which typically land between 5-10% of the stock price.NVDA reached the all-time high price of $140.76 on June 20, which could easily be exceeded based on the current implied volatility around the earnings report. This is especially true if the realized stock price move exceeds the range to the upside.Looking further to the Jan 2025 options cycle, we can see a +-$35.62 expected stock price move. Considering the fact that next week's implied volatility makes up almost 40% of the expected range through the rest of the year and then some, there is plenty of hype and uncertainty around NVIDIA's earnings report on Aug 28 after the stock market closes.Bullish on Nvidia for EarningsIf you're bullish on NVIDIA earnings, you're expecting another stellar quarterly performance from the chip giant, with plenty of positive sentiment from the executive team for the rest of the year.Addressing efficiency improvements and strong demand will be a key factor for continued positive momentum in the stock price. If NVDA stock exceeds the expected move to the upside after the earnings report, we will have a new all time high in NVDA stock overnight.Bearish on Nvidia for earningsIf you're a bearish NVDA stock trader, you're certainly looking for an earnings miss and weak guidance. The fact that competitors are making big strides in isolation could worry NVDA investors and create some selling pressure if there is any weakness in the report.It's not uncommon to see a company post a strong earnings report and have the stock sell off either\u2014this is especially likely for high-flying tech stocks that have already seen massive gains over the years. We've seen this happen in Netflix (NFLX), Google (GOOGL) and many more just this year alone. If NVIDIA exceeds the earnings expected move to the downside, we may see the stock price retreat below July highs.Tune in to Options Trading Concepts Live at 11 a.m. CDT on Aug. 28 ahead of NVIDIA earnings after the bell!Mike Butler,\u00a0tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

Investors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang\u2019s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it\u2019s going to be a \u201cdifficult week\u201d for major tech companies. However, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term. \u201cI still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,\u201d Munster said.  The analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential. \u201cThere is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it\u2019s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.\u201d  In this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee recently said in an interview with CNBC that despite the latest declines tech is \u201cstill in a good place because of AI\u201d and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) position should \u201creinforce that.\u201d He also thinks Nvidia\u2019s multiple is attractive. \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is maybe 28 times forward earnings, which, for one of the most important companies in the world, it\u2019s not a high multiple. So if tech is in a good place, and then we get Fed cuts, I think it allows the overall market to expand,\u201d Lee said.  Analysts are bracing for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled for a release later this month. Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter.   Story Continues \u201cWe expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,\u201d analysts said. Analysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper chips is strong.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said. However, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.Raymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.Aoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.Disclosure: None.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\n\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

The $26.3 billion Data Center revenue highlights NVIDIA's dominance in AI computing. With a gross margin of 75.1%, NVIDIA demonstrates strong pricing power and operational efficiency.The company's forward guidance of $32.5 billion for Q3 FY2025 suggests continued momentum. The $50 billion share repurchase authorization signals management's confidence in future performance.

The company's Hopper and upcoming Blackwell architectures are driving unprecedented demand from data centers and cloud providers. The introduction of NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet and AI Enterprise software demonstrates NVIDIA's evolution into a full-stack AI platform provider.The adoption of NVIDIA's technologies by major players across various industries, from robotics to automotive, indicates the company's expanding influence beyond its traditional gaming market. However, the gaming segment's relatively modest 16% year-over-year growth suggests potential market saturation or increased competition in this space. The company's focus on generative AI and large language models positions it well for future growth, but maintaining such explosive growth rates may become challenging as the market matures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Market Strategist\n                    \n                      \n                        positive\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's performance is reshaping the tech industry landscape. The company's market cap has soared, making it one of the most valuable companies globally. This growth is driving significant changes in major stock indices, potentially affecting passive investment strategies and market dynamics.The company's strong cash flow generation ($13.5 billion in free cash flow this quarter) and robust balance sheet ($34.8 billion in cash and marketable securities) provide ample resources for R&D investments and strategic acquisitions. However, investors should be cautious of the high expectations now priced into the stock. Any slowdown in AI adoption or increased competition could lead to significant volatility. The semiconductor industry's cyclical nature and potential regulatory scrutiny in AI technologies are additional risk factors to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 08/28/2024 - 04:20 PM \nRecord quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, up 15% from Q1 and up 122% from a year ago\u00a0Record quarterly Data Center revenue of $26.3 billion, up 16% from Q1 and up 154% from a year ago SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug.  28, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended July 28, 2024, of $30.0 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and up 122% from a year ago.

CFO CommentaryCommentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast InformationNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.  The earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 28, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +133.3%. Revenues are expected to be $28.24 billion, up 109% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.  Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.   Story Continues Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?For Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.61, delivering a surprise of +10.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nvidia doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory. \u201cNow that positions have been unwound, there\u2019s an opportunity for traders to take positions,\u201d Sluymer reportedly said.  Many others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC. \u201cIf you look at what we\u2019ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it\u2019s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it\u2019s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,\u201d Ives said.  For this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?   Photo by Javier Esteban on Unsplash NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Analysts are bracing for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled for a release later this month. Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter. \u201cWe expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,\u201d analysts said.  Analysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia\u2019s Hopper chips is strong. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said: \u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.    Story Continues However, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.Raymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d Overall,\u00a0NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

Four companies\u2014NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft\u2014 generated essentially all of the MSCI ACWI Index\u2019s and S&P 500\u00ae Index\u2019s Q2 return. NVIDIA represented nearly 40% of the total return for the MSCI ACWI Index and 44% of the total return for the S&P 500\u00ae Index.

Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Tech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a \u201clittle bit of a reset, obviously.\u201d The analyst said that AI stocks had a \u201cgreat run\u201d and the latest pullback is a \u201ctypical process\u201d of market rotation.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that\u2019s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,\u201d Landsberg said. Asked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and called the recent pullback \u201cdeceleration\u201d from growth and \u201cnormalization.\u201d Landsberg said that the earnings season will \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff\u201d and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future. For this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among the Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said: \u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said.  However, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.   Story Continues Raymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.NYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.Aswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages.

Investors adopted a cautious stance while awaiting details on the much-anticipated rollout of the next-generation Blackwell platform.Nvidia's (NVDA) meteoric rise has turned its quarterly earnings report into a must-watch event for investors. This time, the results were undeniably strong, but they also signaled a shift\u2014the company\u2019s growth is beginning to slow.\u00a0Its data center division, until recently the crown jewel of the portfolio, is still expanding but not as quickly. Other segments, like gaming and professional visualization, continue to post only modest gains.\u00a0Five takeaways emerged from yesterday evening\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s earnings conference call. Let\u2019s reflect upon what they mean for the company\u2019s future. But first, here\u2019s a quick reminder of why Nvidia\u2019s earnings report matters: This company has become the most heavily traded single stock in the market, as illustrated below.SherwoodIf you\u2019ve been following Nvidia\u2019s earnings, you might have noticed the company refers to its current fiscal year as 2025, even though we\u2019re still in calendar year 2024. This might seem confusing at first, but it\u2019s actually a relatively common practice.\u00a0Like many other companies, Nvidia operates on a fiscal year that doesn\u2019t perfectly align with the calendar year. Nvidia\u2019s fiscal year starts in February and ends in January of the following year. So, for Nvidia, fiscal year 2025 began in February 2024 and will run through January 2025.Anyway, here are those takeaways we promised\u2014six of them.1. Nvidia posted strong Q2 headline earningsWhile Nvidia\u2019s stock took a hit in after-hours trading, the company turned in a Q2 earnings report that was still impressive by most measures. It posted non-GAAP earnings\u2014which don\u2019t include irregular or non-recurring costs\u2014of $0.68 per share, beating expectations by $0.04. The company\u2019s revenue soared to roughly $30 billion, a staggering 122% increase year-over-year, and 15% quarter-over-quarter.\u00a0Data center revenue, a key driver of growth, climbed to a new record of just over $26 billion, up 16% from the previous quarter and an eye-popping 154% compared to a year ago. This underscores Nvidia\u2019s continued strength in the AI and data center markets, where demand remains robust for its cutting-edge graphics processing units, or GPUs.Looking ahead, Nvidia\u2019s Q3 outlook is equally strong. The company expects revenue to clock in around $32.5 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $31.75 billion. Gross margins are also projected to stay in the mid-70% range, a sign Nvidia is continuing to manage costs effectively, even as it navigates challenges in the market.So, while the stock markets\u2019 reactions might suggest disappointment, the fundamentals in this earnings report tell a different story. They say Nvidia is still enjoying good health.\u00a02. Blackwell chips are expected to roll out in Q4The market\u2019s reaction to this quarter\u2019s strong numbers from Nvidia may have been tempered by deeper concerns\u2014chief among them the anxiety surrounding the forthcoming Blackwell chip. It\u2019s expected to drive a major shift in data centers toward direct-to-chip liquid cooling, an essential for managing the heat generated by advanced AI workloads.\u00a0The chip is slated to slated to begin shipping in Q4, and any further delays could disrupt industry plans and slow the adoption of this critical technology. During the Q2 earnings conference call, management indicated production remains on track. However, given the high stakes, any future delays could have significant consequences, not only for the company\u2019s data center clients but also for its underlying shares.\u00a0Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, expanded further on the status of the Blackwell chip rollout in an interview with Bloomberg Television, immediately following the Q2 earnings call.3. The new $50 billion buybackAs part of its Q2 earnings report, Nvidia announced a massive new $50 billion stock buyback program, a move that undoubtedly caught the market\u2019s attention.\u00a0On the surface, this is a clear positive\u2014it signals Nvidia\u2019s confidence in its future and its belief that its shares are a good investment at current prices. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, buybacks can also boost earnings per share (EPS), and potentially drive the underlying stock\u2019s price higher. For investors, the buyback may represent an attractive way for Nvidia to return value, especially when you consider the company\u2019s strong cash position.\u00a0However, there\u2019s a flip side to the buyback narrative. Nvidia\u2019s growth prospects are among the most exciting in the tech world, particularly in AI and data centers. Critics might therefore argue that the company should be funneling more capital into R&D, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, instead of \u201cmanufacturing\" stock price gains through buybacks. There\u2019s also the concern that this move may indicate a lack of high-return investment opportunities.While the buyback is a vote of confidence from Nvidia, it also raises questions about the company\u2019s strategic priorities and whether it's the best use of its substantial resources at a time of fierce competition and rapid technological advances.4. Margins have weakened but remain strongGross margin, a critical financial metric, offers insight into a company\u2019s overall financial health. It represents the difference between the cost of producing goods and the revenue generated from selling them. The higher the gross margin, the more money a company keeps from every dollar of sales, after covering production and operating costs. Gross margin is a vital indicator because it provides insight into a company\u2019s pricing power, cost management and profitability.In Nvidia\u2019s latest earnings report, gross margin took a noticeable dip, declining from 78% in Q1 to 75% in Q2. That isn\u2019t exactly a red flag, but it does raise some eyebrows. A decrease like this could suggest Nvidia is facing higher production costs, perhaps dealing with supply chain pressures or that it\u2019s been forced to price its products more aggressively to maintain demand.\u00a0In Q3, Nvidia expects its gross margin to clock in around 75%, but the exact figure\u201474.4%\u2014would be lower than what was observed in Q2 (75.7%), although not by much. Going forward, investors will be watching closely to see whether gross margins deteriorate further. If that comes to pass, it would represent an incremental negative.5. Risks intensify in the data center divisionNvidia's data center division has been the powerhouse behind its recent growth, with Q2 revenue reaching a record $26.3 billion, up 154% year-over-year. However, the 16% growth from Q1 to Q2 signals a slowdown compared to the previous quarter, raising concern about Nvidia's heavy reliance on this segment. Notably, quarter-over-quarter growth was higher at 23% from Q4 of last year to Q1 of this year, illustrating how the 16% growth from Q1 to Q2 might be interpreted as disappointing.CapitolTrades.comWith other segments\u2014such as gaming and professional visualization\u2014showing more modest performance, Nvidia\u2019s reliance on its data center division could become a double-edged sword. The data center segment now accounts for much of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, making the company particularly vulnerable if growth in that area slows further.\u00a0Moreover, any downturn in AI-driven demand or increased competition could disproportionately affect Nvidia\u2019s overall financial performance. Investors should keep a close eye on how Nvidia navigates this risk, especially as competition in the data center market heats up.6. China remains a factorNvidia\u2019s dominance in the global semiconductor market could face some challenges, particularly in China, a crucial market for the company. During Nvidia\u2019s Q2 conference call, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Colette Kress, noted that \u201cour data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue.\u201dThis dependency makes the company vulnerable to fluctuations in the Chinese market. The ongoing economic slowdown in China, driven by a mix of weak consumer demand and regulatory uncertainties, could at some point weaken Nvidia's sales in the region. Moreover, increasing competition from local players adds another layer of risk because Nvidia might have to resort to more aggressive pricing , which could further compress margins.\u00a0Adding to these challenges are U.S. restrictions on doing business in China. The U.S. has imposed limits on the export of advanced semiconductor technology to Chinese companies, aiming to curb the country\u2019s access to cutting-edge tech that could have military applications. For Nvidia, these restrictions limit its ability to sell its most advanced products in one of its key markets. This not only reduces potential revenue growth, but also opens the door for Chinese competitors to develop and deploy homegrown technology in the absence of high-quality alternatives.The investment outlook\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Q2 earnings showcased strong performance, reinforcing its leading role in AI and data centers. However, a few challenges have emerged alongside those positive results.\u00a0Growth in the data center division, while still strong, is beginning to slow. That raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s heavy reliance on this segment. The highly anticipated Blackwell chip, critical for advancing data center technology, faces uncertainty because of potential delays. Meanwhile, other segments, like gaming and professional visualization. are delivering only modest gains.\u00a0These issues have likely contributed to the mixed reaction to the company\u2019s Q2 earnings report, as investors reassess Nvidia\u2019s near-term trajectory. While the company remains formidable, maintaining its momentum may be more challenging now. Plus a complex road lies ahead.Nvidia has a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion, and the company\u2019s stock has appreciated by about 160% year-to-date (not including the move after earnings). At the close of trading yesterday, shares were priced at about $125 per share. According to The Wall Street Journal, 61 analysts cover Nvidia, with 47 rating the stock a buy, nine rating it overweight and five rating it a hold. Based on those 61 ratings, the average price target for Nvidia is $142 per share.Andrew Prochnow\u00a0has more than 15 years of experience trading the global financial markets, including 10 years as a professional options trader.

This comes after a panicky trading session in Japan sent that market down 12.4%, wiping out its gains for the year.\nIs Nvidia a Bargain?\nThe overnight fall left Nvidia with a market capitalization of $2.35 trillion. It was over $3 trillion less than a month ago. At the current price, it is still selling at 19 times its estimated fiscal 2025 sales of $120 billion.\nThe stock remains highly volatile. Chicago Federal Reserve president Austen Goolsbee\u2019s reassuring words that if the economy falters,\u00a0the Fed will \u201cfix it\u201d reassured markets before their 9:30 a.m. opening.\nNvidia is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28. Analysts expect revenue of $28.5 billion and earnings of 64 cents per share.\nBefore the market fell analysts were putting a price target of $144 per share on Nvidia stock. That would represent a huge gain from present levels.\nWhile there is no reason to believe sales momentum has slowed, a Department of Justice probe into its purchase of Run.ai sent it down 7% on Aug. 2.\nThe rest of the company\u2019s news remains good. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) said it will have 350,000 Nvidia H-100 chips online by the end of the year. Nvidia is already building generative artificial intelligence (AI) models based on Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1 Large Language Model (LLM).\nNvidia\u2019s dominance of the AI market is based on software as much as hardware. Nvidia Cuda software is a de-facto industry standard, and it has built application program interfaces (APIs) on top of it.\nNVDA Stock: What Happens Next?\nNvidia is likely to bounce quickly off its lows. But investors should also remember that they\u2019re buying 2026 numbers now, not just the current results.\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in NVDA.\nDana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

Since it hit $135 per share in early July, the stock has sold off heavily and now sits at just shy of $100 per share. That's a near-30% decline from its high, indicating that Nvidia stock is in its own bear market. \nWhile this may cause some investors to panic, it may provide other investors a chance to buy the stock at a discount after missing the initial rise. So, is Nvidia stock a buy here? Or is this a reasonable price correction?\nTwo long-term non-factors are influencing Nvidia's stock\nThe broader stock market sell-off is loosely attributed to a trading strategy that caused investors to borrow the Japanese Yen at low interest rates and then use that money to invest in some of the most dominant tech stocks in the U.S. market (like Nvidia). Now that Japan has signaled it is tightening interest rates, anyone doing this is selling their shares to return the money before higher interest rates kick in.\n\nAdditionally, there is some fear that the U.S. Federal Reserve is asleep at the wheel and that it should be cutting interest rates. With unemployment rising steadily, many are concerned that we're actually in the beginning phases of a recession.\nThese prevailing headwinds aren't doing Nvidia investors any favors, but they allow long-term investors to add more at a great price. These factors won't stop artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, so it doesn't make sense to factor them into the long-term investment thesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Nvidia is the top supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computing power necessary to train AI models, it has benefited greatly over the past year and a half as the AI arms race heats up. This isn't projected to slow anytime soon, and investors should focus on the AI infrastructure buildout.\nHowever, is the sell-off deep enough to warrant buying Nvidia stock?\nNvidia's stock is now in the buy zone\nValuing Nvidia stock is incredibly difficult because of its rapid growth and transformation. The best way to value it is by using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) method, which uses analyst earnings projections over the next 12 months to assess the stock. While this method isn't perfect, it's the best way to assess Nvidia.\nThanks to the sell-off, Nvidia trades for an expensive but much more reasonable 36 times forward earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\nWhile this only resets the valuation to late May levels (before its first-quarter earnings report), it's still not a bad price. Since its big tech peers like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft aren't that much cheaper than Nvidia, trading respectively for 35, 31, and 30 times forward earnings. Plus, they don't have nearly the growth potential, it's starting to look like Nvidia may be worth buying. \nIf you're going to buy Nvidia stock, it's probably best to do it before Aug. 28. That's when Nvidia reports Q2 earnings for its fiscal 2025, and Nvidia's stock has popped after almost every earnings report dating back to Q1 FY 2024. I'd be surprised if anything Nvidia says in that earnings report sends the stock lower, as all of the language from the cloud computing providers and any other company investing heavily in AI servers has stated they will only spend more over the next year.\nThis is great news for Nvidia and is a fantastic reason to buy the stock now amid the market sell-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0stands against the other stocks. If we were to try and summarize one of the biggest ways how to make money on the stock market, it\u2019d include buying stocks of firms that have changed the world. The biggest and\u00a0most valuable companies\u00a0of today didn\u2019t start that way, and those who had a chance to invest in them decades back are considerably well off and some are even among the richest people in the world.  In fact, the two biggest technologies that have changed the world since the 1970s are personal computing and the Internet. Within these, the former is older and started through the launch of products such as Windows and the Mac. The two companies that make these products are up by 405,920% and 166,238% on the stock market since their shares were listed. So, if you, or anyone you know, had bought $1,000 of shares back then, your investment would be worth $4 million or $1.7 million today. Along with personal computing, the Internet is the second world changing technology that has not only reformed the way in which businesses operate and regular people live their lives but also left a slew of billionaires in its wake. Starting from the dotcom era of the 1990s, the few companies that did survive the \u2018pop\u2019 are among the largest and most valuable in the world today. These have managed to use the power of the Internet to change the way people shop and access information. The former, founded by Jeff Bezos, whose latest net worth is estimated to sit at $190 billion, is up 185,389% since its stock started trading.  A $1,000 investment back then would be worth $1.9 million. Similarly, the world\u2019s largest search engine company and the\u00a0world\u2019s biggest social media firm, are up by 5,939% and 1,254% since their stock started trading in the 2000s. It\u2019s a testament to the power of world changing technologies to drive stock prices that these quad digit percentage returns appear to be \u2018meager\u2019 when compared to the six digit returns of the world changing stocks that have been trading since the 1970s and the 1990s. But what about 2024? After all, while these disruptive stocks have made their mark on Wall Street history, it is highly unlikely that they will yield similar returns in the future. Well, one disruptive technology that has caught the world by storm is artificial intelligence. Spurred by the public launch of the chatbot ChatGPT, AI\u2019s proponents swear that it will transform the world just like the Internet did. This transformation is being spearheaded by big tech, as the\u00a0largest technology companies in the world\u00a0fork out billions of dollars in AI spending.   Story Continues Data shows that during the first half of 2024, the four biggest AI players spent a whopping $106 billion in spending as part of a game theory-esque roulette that Mark Zuckerberg described as risking \u201cbuilding capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.\u201d As for the future, analysts expect that AI spending over the next five years could touch a\u00a0whopping\u00a0$1 trillion. This spending has also driven the shares of the world\u2019s pre eminent AI GPU maker (and the youngest game changing stock) to rise by 261,775% since they started trading.Looking at these gains makes it even more important that we try to wager a guess at what future industries can change the world. One way to somewhat simplify our research is to look at what investment newsletters are saying. The writers of these newsletters are often on the hunt for high growth sectors since correctly identifying them leads to a boost of credibility that drives subscriptions and eventually leads to revenue. On this front, we looked at some such industries as part of our coverage of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.Within these industries, two that stand out are quantum computing and nuclear energy. For those out of the loop, quantum computing is an expansion of current computing as it significantly increases the data that a computer can compute. However, quantum computing stocks are laggards in the stock market. We covered top hedge fund quantum computing stock picks during our coverage of\u00a012 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In. Out of these 12 stocks, 10 either have quantum computing returns baked into their stock price or are too important in the industry to ignore. Analyzing their year to date performance reveals that out of these ten quantum computing stocks, four are in the green and this drops to three if we focus only on pureplay quantum computing stocks. These three stocks rank\u00a05th,\u00a07th,\u00a0and\u00a012th\u00a0on our list, and they are up by 2.7% to 129.75%, year to date.For nuclear energy, let\u2019s look at the stocks that are part of the list of the\u00a012 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Buy Today. In this list, roughly seven nuclear energy stocks have considerable exposure to power generation. Their one year share price appreciation ranges between 79.8% to 11.38%, and the top three performing stocks are ranked\u00a03rd,\u00a05th,\u00a0and\u00a012th.\u00a0As a refresher, nuclear energy is popular these days because of its potential to provide clean energy to AI data centers.Finally, another sector that might change the world is robotics. Some Wall Street analysts are gushing over the sector as they believe that humanoid robots in particular can unlock a $30 trillion opportunity. This is on the back of these robots being able to perform jobs that humans are unwilling or unsuited for, and even Elon Musk is bullish on them as he believes that his car company could benefit from this unstoppable demand and become worth $25 trillion as a result. For more details, you can check out\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.Our MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that can change the world, we started with our coverage of\u00a010 Stocks That Will Change the Future,\u00a0analyzed their performance, and fine tuned the list to align with today\u2019s hottest industries. Then, we scanned media reports for sectors such as AI, self driving, gene editing, weight loss drugs, and robotics. From these reports, a stock was chosen if it was mentioned in three or more reports. This yielded a final list of five new stocks.For these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

This is because it can transform the world through artificial intelligence and robotics, according to media reports. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers products such as its GR00T model to make AI powered humanoid robots and the Thor system on chip processor for robots.This means that the firm provides an end to end platform that directly targets the robotics industry and is more relevant than say, Rockwell Automation\u2019s products. On the AI front, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs are industry leaders in performance and offer users the key ability to fine tune performance via CUDA. At the same time, the firm\u2019s AI leadership, which has also led to a tight GPU supply and higher prices, could spur big tech into action and develop its own products to relieve some of the pressure. Additionally, any worries about product execution, as evidenced by the recent reports of Blackwel GPU delays, could lead to headwinds for the shares.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s management shared details for Blackwell during the\u00a0Q1 2025 earnings call:\u201cAt GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will change the world. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a010 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

The company's share price has skyrocketed 155% across this year's trading alone, and continued momentum for sales and earnings could help push its valuation even higher.  As eye-catching as Nvidia's big gains in 2024 have been, its long-term performance is actually far more impressive. The company has shifted from primarily being a designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for video games to the leading provider of processors for data centers and AI. As a result, the tech pioneer has risen from a market capitalization of roughly $10.3 billion a decade ago to a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion today. Nvidia stock shows the power of long-term investing Nvidia stock has delivered a total return of more than 27,000% over the last decade. That means that if you invested $1,000 in the stock 10 years ago and held onto your position, your holdings would now be worth more than $271,000.   NVDA Total Return Level data by YCharts.   Nvidia's incredible success and performance for shareholders is a testament to the benefits of long-term investing. The market-crushing run also shows that it only takes a handful of big winners to power incredible gains for your portfolio. For example, imagine you had invested $1,000 in nine other companies a decade ago in addition to investing the same amount in Nvidia. Even if each of those nine other stocks when to $0 per share, Nvidia's performance would have meant that you would have scored more than $261,000 in profits on your initial $10,000 investment.  Of course, finding these kinds of massive winners is easier said than done -- but there are stocks on the market right now that could go on to be \"the next Nvidia.\" Even the hottest stocks aren't going to turn $1,000 into more than $271,000 overnight, but giving strong companies time to execute their growth strategies and seize new opportunities can be a path to life-changing wealth creation.

However, this impressive journey has been marked by volatility. After briefly becoming the world\u2019s most valuable public company in June, Nvidia\u2019s stock price took a sharp downturn, losing almost 30% of its value, or about $800 billion, over seven weeks. The chipmaker has since rebounded, with its stock now trading within 6% of its all-time high. As Nvidia prepares to report its quarterly results, investors are keenly focused on any signs of cooling AI demand or reduced spending by major cloud customers.Nvidia\u2019s data center business powers growthNvidia\u2019s revenue has more than tripled in the last three quarters, driven largely by its data center division, which supplies the graphics processing units (GPUs) crucial for AI workloads. Analysts are forecasting another strong quarter, with an expected 112% increase in revenue to $28.7 billion. However, the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons in the coming quarters, with growth projected to slow over the next six quarters. For the upcoming October quarter, Nvidia is expected to report a 75% growth, reaching $31.7 billion. Any deviation from these expectations could significantly impact investor sentiment.Google and Meta\u2019s investments boost NvidiaNvidia\u2019s stock gained nearly 10% in August, bolstered by continued investments from top customers like Google and Meta in data centers and Nvidia-based infrastructure. While this optimism has driven recent gains, there are concerns about the sustainability of such spending. The company\u2019s performance in the October quarter will be a key indicator of ongoing demand for AI infrastructure. A strong outlook could signal continued robust demand, while a disappointing forecast might suggest that the surge in infrastructure spending is tapering off.Adding to the uncertainty is the timeline for Nvidia\u2019s next-generation AI chips, known as Blackwell. Recent reports indicate that production issues could delay large-scale shipments until the first quarter of 2025, later than initially expected. Although Nvidia maintains that production is on track for the latter half of the year, any delays could raise questions about the company\u2019s ability to maintain its technological edge over competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Google.Nvidia\u2019s long-term ROI Despite expanding profit margins, Nvidia faces scrutiny over the long-term return on investment for its clients, who purchase high-cost devices in bulk. During the last earnings call, CFO Colette Kress noted that cloud providers\u2014who account for more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue\u2014could generate $5 in revenue for every $1 spent on Nvidia chips over four years. Investors will be looking for additional metrics this quarter to reinforce their confidence.While its stock has recovered from a recent dip, driven by sustained demand for AI infrastructure, uncertainties around future growth rates, product timelines, and customer spending persist. Investors will closely monitor Nvidia\u2019s forecast and management commentary to determine whether the company\u2019s growth trajectory is sustainable or if the recent rally is at risk of losing momentum.InvezzRead more from InvezzAnalyze on SuperchartsRealtime newsMore realtime newsMore news from InvezzMore news\n \n\n\n\n\nLove in every\n#TradingView100M+Traders and investors use our platform.#1Top website in the world when it comes to all things investing.1.5M+Mobile reviews with 4.9 average rating.

Plus, two trade ideas.Tomorrow\u2019s Nvidia (NVDA) earnings release has the potential power to affect the major indices. Some 22% of the Semiconductor ETF (SMH) weight is in NVDA. It also makes up 7% of the S&P 500 (SPY) and 8% of the Nasdaq (QQQ).NVDA's influence on competitorsLast earnings, NVDA\u2019s price moved 9% after its release, and the earnings before that was 16%. High volatility is expected.Below we show how other Semiconductor companies moved on NVDA\u2019s previous six earnings quarters.Other big names in earningsSome big names besides Nvida that report earnings this week include Crowdstrike Holdings (CRWD), Salesforce (CRM), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).NVDA is the most anticipated earnings coming out this week:Gold outperforms ...It\u2019s always about context, but for the past year, gold is outperforming the overall indices.Two trade ideasSMH ($243) broken wing butterfly (AUG30)1. NVDA earnings are on tap this week\u2014it accounts for nearly 22% of the weighting in SMH, the semiconductor ETF. If you think it might move higher but don't want the downside risk with NVDA near highs, a broken wing butterfly would fit the assumption. Using the weekly expiration, long the 247.5 call, short 1x of the 250 and 255 call, and long a 265 wing trades for a $0.38 credit, no risk to the downside and up to an additional $250 if the ETF expires between 250-255.2. TSM ($168) short strangle (OCT)TSM is the second largest holding in the SMH ETF at almost 14%. It tends to move with a high correlation to NVDA, but much lower beta. If you think NVDA might be an inside move\u2014or at least a significant vol crush in the space\u2014a wide strangle in TSM would fit the assumption. Short the 140/200 strangle is a roughly one standard deviation strangle trading at $4.25 with risk starting at new highs, or nearly new lows over the last couple months.Michael Rechenthin, Ph.D., (aka \u201cDr. Data\u201d), managing director of research and development, has 25 years of trading and markets experience.

The stock is still up over 160% on year.  Earnings report coming August 28.  Illustration by TradingViewTowering tech mainstay ended its longest winning streak since March as investors took a cautious stance despite otherwise calm market. Nvidia stock NVDA fell over 2% Tuesday to close at $127.25 per share. The company snapped its longest streak since March \u2014 a total of six days \u2014 as investors decided to take a risk-off approach to the volatile stock (despite a gargantuan valuation of $3.13 trillion.) The drop wasn\u2019t pointing to a specific event other than the broader-market pullback with all three major stock indexes shifting lower.  Still, this stock is likely to get moving over the next few trading sessions. The chip maker, led by Jensen Huang, is preparing to offload its earnings data. On August 28, Nvidia will report its financials for the most recent quarter. And with the earnings season now largely in the rearview mirror, Nvidia\u2019s report will be everything that day. Prepare for volatility and even some outsized moves \u2014 these are not foreign to Nvidia.  With Tuesday\u2019s drop factored in, Nvidia still brags a hefty 164% increase this year. In comparison, the broad-based S&P 500 is up about 17% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is higher by 19% over the same time span. On the other end of the spectrum, the technology heavyweight is about 6% away from its record high of $135.58 hit on June 18.

Inan Dogan, PhD   August 29, 2024 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.03%     GOOG   -2.28%      NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) just reported its latest earnings results. Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report exceeded expectations, with revenue reaching $30 billion, up 122% year-over-year and 15% quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance translated into adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68, surpassing analysts' forecasts of $28.6 billion and $0.64, respectively. Yet, NVDA stock is down around 7% after hours. Why?  To answer this question, we have to take a look at NVIDIA Corporation's outlook for the current quarter. Here is what the company said: \u2022 Revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. \u2022 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, gross margins are expected to be in the mid-70% range.   Nvidia, Software   Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Nvidia's market cap before today's earnings report was $3.1 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $140 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 21. NVIDIA Corporation's quarterly revenue and profit were $30 billion and $16.6 billion respectively though. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA's quarterly profit can go from $16.6 billion today to $35 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL's quarterly profit is growing?  Investors were surprised to see that NVDA projected only an 8% quarterly revenue growth rate for its next quarterly report (vs. 15% for the last quarter). The decline in quarterly revenue growth rate is really concerning and if the decline continues, it will be awfully clear to investors that NVDA will never get to the $140 billion annual profit figure that its current stock price is demanding. I am Insider Monkey's co-founder and its research director. We have been recommending a long position in NVDA since May of 2023 and the stock's performance has been good to our subscribers. I also personally own a small position in NVDA shares. However, I believe that NVDA's revenue projections have disappointed investors and they are responding by selling their shares. This is a well-deserved crash and NVDA shares might decline even more tomorrow when the markets open. While I acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an AI investment, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

See today's pick now.\nNvidia Corp NVDA has seen its market value decline by $900 billion since its peak in June 2024, despite the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) spending.\nWhile this drop might suggest a cooling of the AI boom that propelled Nvidia to its heights, the underlying trends tell a different story.\nU.S. Big Tech giants led by Microsoft Corp MSFT, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, Alphabet Inc GOOGL, and Meta Platforms Inc META, which represent over 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, have all committed to continued investment in AI infrastructure, Bloomberg reports. Nvidia stock is trading up on Friday.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia Greenlights Samsung\u2019s Fifth-Gen HBM3E Chips for AI Processors: Report\nSuper Micro Computer Inc SMCI, a company that manufactures data center servers used in AI applications, recently projected sales could reach up to $30 billion over the next year, surpassing analyst expectations.\nKey Nvidia supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM saw its revenue surge by 45% in July, outpacing the growth rate from the June quarter.\nAnalysts forecast Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s third-quarter revenue to rise by 37%, and the strong July performance indicates that TSMC might exceed these projections, Bloomberg reports.\nRhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC, told Bloomberg that companies have yet to reduce their AI spending or report issues with their AI initiatives.\nSrini Pajjuri, managing director and senior research analyst at Raymond James, told Bloomberg the uncertainty surrounding the monetization of AI and questioned how long companies can sustain this level of spending without straightforward returns.\nKen Mahoney, president and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Bloomberg that the recent selloff has brought Nvidia\u2019s valuation down to about 30 times forward earnings, potentially making it more attractive to long-term investors.\nNvidia stock has increased by over 135% in the last 12 months despite losing 22% in the last 30 days. Investors can gain exposure to Nvidia through the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI.\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded higher by 1.29% at $106.32 premarket at last check Friday.\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto:ShutterstockNVDANVIDIA Corp$120.650.94%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum85.55Growth88.64Quality97.50Value6.95Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewAMZNAmazon.com Inc$196.200.24%GOOGLAlphabet Inc$164.540.15%IVViShares Core S&P 500 ETF$568.060.04%METAMeta Platforms Inc$605.080.03%MSFTMicrosoft Corp$388.35-0.09%SMCISuper Micro Computer Inc$42.300.86%TSMTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd$175.650.05%VTIVanguard Total Stock Market ETF--%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

NVDA stock can\u2019t possibly keep rising, can it?\nAfter hitting over $130 in June, Nvidia briefly fell below $100 per share before recovering to $110. The next date to watch is Aug. 28, when it reports third quarter earnings.\nBefore deciding whether to jump back in or abandon ship, it\u2019s time to revisit Nvidia\u2019s AI vision.\nJensen\u2019s Dreams\nNvidia is fortunate co-founder Jensen Huang remains at the helm. Like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) legend Andy Grove, and unlike Grove\u2019s successors, he\u2019s a product guy. Product guys (or gals) grow their companies for customers, not just stockholders.\nHuang is focused on evolving his AI chips, derived from graphics processing units (GPU). Today\u2019s H-100 Hopper will become next year\u2019s B-100 Blackwell and, in 2026, the R-100 Rubin, named for astronomer Vera Rubin.\nThe designs use \u201cHuang\u2019s Law\u201d a belief that progress with number-crunching chips can move faster than circuit densities. They do this mainly by getting bigger. While Nvidia chips are now sold to data centers, the modern equivalent of mainframes, they should evolve over time to single server racks, server boxes and eventually to tomorrow\u2019s PCs and laptops.\nThe result will be computers like those found in Star Trek. They will offer a variety of interfaces, insanely rapid absorption of huge data sets and instant analysis beyond anything the human mind is capable of.\nIn terms of AI\u2019s evolution, Huang believes we\u2019re where PCs were in the 1970s. It\u2019s not that far-fetched, since Nvidia began its rise making graphics cards for gaming PCs.\nJensen\u2019s Nightmares\nThere are two problems with this vision, which are behind the recent fall in NVDA stock.\nFirst is the energy consumption of the Hopper AI chips. It\u2019s unsustainable.\nBlackwell and Rubin will use even more energy. Nvidia talks about efficiency. But customers are now taking coal plants out of mothballs and dreaming of nuclear reactors.\nSecond is the nature of current AI software. The first version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was a revolution. The fourth iteration isn\u2019t. Large language models (LLMs) are prone to \u201challucinations,\u201d creating impossible answers because their analysis lacks real world structure.\nThis leads to AI drawing people with three hands. It leads to self-driving cars running into pedestrians. Today\u2019s AI is Spock, demanding logic, in a world of illogical Kirks.\nTo AI scientist Gary Marcus, this means the generative AI boom is about to bust. It may have busted in July. That\u2019s when analysts decided the industry\u2019s earnings and growth rate were not good enough.\nIf LLMs are a dead end, it means AI must evolve through software. We need new algorithms and new ways of modeling intelligence. While Nvidia software can model a variety of AI algorithms, it can\u2019t model those that don\u2019t yet exist. Things need to be invented for AI to move ahead.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe boom that began with ChatGPT in November 2022 is busting. But that\u2019s different from claiming AI is just another \u201cmetaverse.\u201d \nJensen Huang\u2019s dream is not dead. The hardware is just ahead of the software. Reaching true \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d first requires us to think about what makes real intelligence. That\u2019s going to take time, and it\u2019s going to evolve alongside AI hardware, maybe even behind it. You can\u2019t rush science. \u00a0\nWhat does this mean for investors? If you\u2019re 20, 30 or 40, buy NVDA stock when it dips for your retirement account. If you\u2019re 70 or 80, you may not have time to wait.\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a LONG position in INTC.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day just above the flatline to claim another back-to-back record high. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) each closed up around 0.2%.  Stocks are struggling to find a footing as investors debate whether chipmaker Nvidia's high-stakes results on Wednesday can once again live up to elevated expectations. Semiconductor stocks lost ground on Tuesday alongside a 1% drop for the AI darling, a sign of how Nvidia's report could ripple through techs as it tests the AI trade that has driven gains. At the same time, investors are counting down to a crucial update to the inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve. Chair Jerome Powell's clear message that an interest rate cut is imminent confirmed widespread confidence in a policy pivot in September. Friday's reading on the PCE price index could dent or cement bets on a 0.5% interest rate cut next month. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) is replacing its long-standing CFO with an insider, Kevan Parekh, with just two weeks to go for its biggest product launch of the year.

I think they will,\" Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. \"I think they will once again exceed earnings expectations. They'll exceed reveue expectations, and they're going to announce substantial growth in their data center business data centers.\"\"I think Nvidia is positioning themselves to be the hub of the AI ecosystem in a similar fashion that Amazon became the hub of the e-commerce ecosystem,\" he said.Of course, expectations are incredibly elevated, with the stock up about 160% since the start of the year.

And now that investors have already bought the dip, the looming question heading into a highly anticipated earnings release after the market close on Wednesday is what Nvidia can say to keep investors excited.With Wall Street expecting earnings for the quarter grew nearly 109% and revenue soared almost 100% compared to the year prior, the bar is once again for the AI leader.\"It needs to be a beat and raise [guidance] quarter because I think that's sort of built into investor expectations,\" Stifel applied technology analyst Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance. \"Certainly the discussions that we're having with success suggest that there's widely anticipated expectations for a beat for the July quarter earnings and then a sort of a beat on the guidance for the October quarter.\"    Wed, August 28, 2024 at 1:27 AM GMT+8 Alexandra Canal  Here comes Nvidia's earnings report...  AI juggernaut Nvidia (NVDA) will report second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday. The report has been branded as critical for the artificial intelligence trade and the tech sector at large.Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley has a preview of what to expect:Nvidia\u2019s announcement \u2014 the most anticipated results of the quarter \u2014 comes as the stock is up more than 163% year to date and 60% in the last six months. Rival AMD\u2019s (AMD) stock price is up 9% year to date and down some 14% over the last six months.Intel (INTC) shares have collapsed 57% since the start of the year and are down 53% over the last six months as the company continues to struggle amid its massive turnaround effort.For the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.65 on revenue of $28.7 billion. That works out to a 139% jump in EPS and a 113% increase in revenue compared to the same period a year ago when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5 billion.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.04 -2.49 (-2.08%)  As of 3:03:43 PM EDT.

And it\u2019s expected to continue to hold that lead as it begins rolling out its next-generation Blackwell line of chips.And while the Information has reported a potential delay in Blackwell shipments, analysts at firms including Goldman Sachs, KeyBanc, and Loop Capital don\u2019t see that as much of a concern for Nvidia in the near term.\u201cOur work suggests that while Blackwell is in fact delayed as we first wrote about on [Aug. 8], it could be more like 120 days vs 90 days ... although it may not matter much as [1)] Hopper yields from TSMC continue to improve and [2)] The amount of increased Hopper production through the fall may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out,\u201d Loop Capital managing director Ananda Baruah said in an investor note.For the quarter, Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center business is expected to bring in $24 billion in revenue, a 142% increase from the $10.3 billion the segment saw in the same quarter last year. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to not only beat its Q2 expectations but raise its guidance for Q3.Read more here.

All three of those indexes moved more than 5% higher in mid-afternoon trading.The positive moves for the XLRE come after price increases moderated somewhat in June, according to the latest reading of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.The index increased 0.2% month over month on a seasonally adjusted basis, less than the 0.3% rise seen in May. However, home prices remain at a record, with the index climbing for a fifth straight month to hit an all-time high in June.Energy, meanwhile, was the biggest laggard of the day after crude oil dropped about 2%, reversing previous gains. Oil had ripped 3% higher on Monday as production cuts in Libya, coupled with more tensions in the Middle East, added to supply concerns.

At the time, the proposed $6 billion takeover of National Amusements threatened to derail the roughly $8 billion agreement the company reached with Skydance just one month prior.According to multiple reports, Bronfman had difficulty securing the financing for the deal, which included investors like Fortress and BC Partners Credit. This difficulty led to Bronfman's early withdrawal from the bid process.\"We continue to believe that Paramount Global is an extraordinary company, with an unrivaled collection of marquee brands, assets and people,\" Bronfman said in a statement.The Skydance transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval.Read more here.   Tue, August 27, 2024 at 10:05 PM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Consumer confidence rises more than expected despite weakening labor outlook Consumer confidence rose more than expected in August despite a continued weakening in consumers' assessment of the labor market.The latest index reading from the Conference Board was 103.3, above the 101.9 seen in July and higher than the 100.7 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected.\"Overall consumer confidence rose in August but remained within the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years,\" said Dana M. Peterson, Conference Board chief economist. \"Consumers continued to express mixed feelings in August. Compared to July, they were more positive about business conditions, both current and future, but also more concerned about the labor market.\"Peterson added: \"Consumers' assessments of the current labor situation, while still positive, continued to weaken, and assessments of the labor market going forward were more pessimistic. This likely reflects the recent increase in unemployment. Consumers were also a bit less positive about future income.\"The report comes as recent economic data has shown softening in the labor market. In July, the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. Meanwhile, the US labor market added 114,000 jobs, the second-lowest monthly total since 2020.In August's consumer confidence report, 32.8% of people said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 33.4% in July. Meanwhile, 16.4% said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up slightly from 16.3%.

Since its debut at Computex 2023 in the Ramen Shop tech demo, ACE\u2019s capabilities have evolved rapidly.\nAt Gamescom 2024, we announced our first digital human technology on-device small language model improving the conversation abilities of game characters. We also announced that the first game to showcase these ACE and digital human technologies is Amazing Seasun Game\u2019s Mecha BREAK, bringing its characters to life and providing a more dynamic and immersive gameplay experience on GeForce RTX AI PCs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Small Language Model Purpose-Built For Role-Playing\nNVIDIA\u2019s first digital human technology on-device small language model, called Nemotron-4 4B Instruct, is designed for role-playing, with leading retrieval-augmented generation and function-calling capabilities, allowing game characters to respond to gamers, more intuitively comprehend player instructions, and perform more accurate and relevant actions.\nNemotron-4 4B Instruct is available as an NVIDIA NIM for cloud and on-device deployment by game developers. The NIMs are optimized for low memory usage, offering faster response times and providing developers a way to take advantage of over 100 million GeForce RTX-powered PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACE Technologies Showcased In First Game, Mecha BREAK\nMecha BREAK, developed by Amazing Seasun Games, a Kingsoft Corporation game subsidiary, has implemented the NVIDIA Nemotron-4 4B Instruct NIM running on-device in the first showcase of ACE-powered game interactions. Additionally, NVIDIA Audio2Face-3D NIM and Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s automatic speech recognition model, provide facial animation and speech recognition running on device, while Elevenlabs powers the character\u2019s voice through the cloud.\nMecha BREAK is a multiplayer mech game that allows players to choose from diverse mechs, customize appearances, and battle colossal war machines on treacherous terrain. In the ACE showcase demo, players can interact via natural language with game characters, most notably the player\u2019s mechanic. Ask for advice on objectives, the ideal mech for the task, and more, before having their mech\u2019s paint job quickly updated for maximum battlefield bling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to showcase the power and potential of ACE NIMs in Mecha BREAK, using Audio2Face and NVIDIA Nemotron-4 4B Instruct to dramatically enhance in-game immersion,\u201d said Kris Kwok, CEO of Amazing Seasun Games.\nMecha BREAK will launch in 2025, players can sign up for future playtests on the game\u2019s Steam page.

At the same time, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) bucked the selloff to become the first non-tech company to top more than $1 trillion in market capitalization.\u00a0What's supposed to be one of the quietest trading weeks of the year was rudely interrupted by Nvidia \u2013 the most influential stock in the world right now \u2013 releasing second-quarter results after Wednesday\u2019s close. NVDA has an outsized role in setting the market's direction, and for good reason. The company's status as by far the most important supplier of chips for everything AI means that it counts the other six members of the Magnificent 7 as its customers.\u00a0Since the majority of the bull market's gains have been driven by this select group of Mag 7 plays, it's only natural that speculators and traders might take something off their positions ahead of NVDA's results. After all, the old Wall Street saying of \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" is as good as any in explaining NVDA stock's massive selloff Wednesday. Shares tumbled more than 4% at one point during the session, putting heavy pressure on the cap-weighted indexes, before closing down 2.1%.\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nOf course, volatility has always been the price of admission to this high-flying name. Indeed, anyone who put $1,000 into Nvidia stock 20 years ago would be stunned \u2013 in a good way \u2013 by what it's worth today. \u00a0Stocks on the moveWhile the market awaited the Nvidia news, a slew of consumer discretionary names continued to report mixed results.\u00a0Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) stock plunged 17% despite beating top- and bottom-line expectations for its second quarter.As a result of its strong performance in the first half of the year, ANF raised its outlook for the full fiscal year. The company now anticipates revenue growth in the range of 12% to 13% and an operating margin of 14% to 15%. This compares to the retailer's previous forecast of revenue growth of roughly 10% and an operating margin of about 14%.For the third quarter, ANF said revenue should grow in the low double-digits compared to the year-ago period, while its operating margin should arrive between 13% to 14%.Chewy (CHWY) stock soared 11.1% after the online pet products retailer met revenue expectations and reported earnings that were well ahead of expectations for its second quarter.For the third quarter, Chewy said it anticipates revenue in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.86 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 2% to 3%. Analysts were forecasting revenue of $2.86 billion.Chewy also reiterated its revenue forecast for the full fiscal year, anticipating sales of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion. It also raised its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin outlook to 4.5% to 4.7% from 4.1% to 4.3%.Foot Locker (FL) stock plummeted 10.2% despite topping analysts\u2019 expectations for its second quarter.Foot Locker also reaffirmed its outlook for the full fiscal year. The company continues to expect revenue to range from a decline of 1% to a gain of 1%, comparable-store sales growth between 1% to 3%, and earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.70.However, the retailer lowered its gross margin outlook for the full year, to a range of 29.5% to 29.7% from the prior guidance of 29.8% to 30.0%, which could explain today's slump.At the closing bell, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4% to 41,091, while the broader S&P 500 shed 0.6% to 5,592. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1% to finish at 17,556.\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway tops $1 trillionWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway added 0.8% in a down market to break the trillion-dollar market cap level for the first time. Berkshire joins Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) as the only companies with market values of at least $1 trillion.\u00a0Although BRK.B is the first non-tech stock to reach such a once-unthinkable valuation, should anyone really be surprised? The Berkshire Hathaway portfolio counts Apple as a top holding, even if Buffett has slashed its AAPL stake. It has exposure to AMZN too. Berkshire shareholders don't appear to be alarmed that Buffett is selling stocks such as Bank of America (BAC) and Chevron (CVX).\u00a0Whatever the Oracle of Omaha is up to, it's working very well on the price charts in 2024. BRK.B, which doesn't pay a dividend, gained 30% for the year to date through August 28. The S&P 500, with dividends included, returned 18% over the same span.Only four analysts cover BRK.B, per S&P Global Market Intelligence, and it doesn't really matter what they say since they're looking only 12 to 18 months out with a long-term holding. Nevertheless, with two Strong Buy ratings and two Hold calls, Berkshire Hathaway stock receives a consensus recommendation of Buy with mixed conviction.By the way, since 1964, Berkshire Hathaway has generated an overall gain of 4,384,748%. The S&P 500 gained 31,223% over the same span. On a compounded annual basis, Buffett has doubled the performance of the broader market over the past 60 decades. At that rate, a trillion dollars in market cap was just a matter of time.\u00a0\n\nTrack all markets on TradingView\nRelated contentCan a President Fix Inflation?Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Earnings?Kiplinger's Earnings Calendar and Analysis\n\nTOPICS\n\nS&P 500\nDow Jones Industrial Average\nNasdaq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Kiplinger Today newsletter \u2014 freeProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nNvidia Corp NVDA stock is trading higher on Monday.\nKen Mahoney, president and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, told Bloomberg that Nvidia\u2019s valuation has dropped to around 30 times forward earnings after the recent selloff, which could make the stock more appealing to long-term investors.\nThe analyst said that the key artificial intelligence beneficiary stock has been up 152% in the last 12 months despite losing ~15% in the previous 30 days.\n\nNvidia\u2019s success reflects its success in building a \u201cwalled garden\u201d of developers who build AI systems and other software with its chips, the Wall Street Journal reports.\u00a0\nThis ecosystem, centered around Nvidia\u2019s software platform CUDA, has made it nearly impossible for competitors to gain significant ground in the AI market.\nNvidia will likely have more leverage than its rivals as it continues to concentrate on its coding adeptness.\nCUDA, launched in 2007, allows Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips, GPUs, to run non-graphics software, including AI applications.\nJensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, describes this approach as \u201cfull-stack computing,\u201d where the company provides the chips and the software necessary to build AI systems.\nThis strategy has solidified Nvidia\u2019s position as the dominant player in the AI chip market, with an estimated 90% market share expected to continue for the next few years.\nThe AI chip market is projected to reach $400 billion annually by 2027.\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia through VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF SCHG.\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded higher by 5.30% at $110.24 at the last check on Monday.\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nImage via Nvidia BlogNVDANVIDIA Corp$120.630.92%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum85.55Growth88.64Quality97.50Value6.95Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewSCHGSchwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF--%SMHVanEck Semiconductor ETF$228.80-0.07%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

As the Destined One, explore a vast and enchanting world filled with challenges and jaw-dropping wonders. Discover hidden truths behind ancient legends and unveil secrets of a glorious past, enhanced by full ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 3; use the power of the GeForce RTX 40 Series for an unparalleled PC experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing is a demanding but highly accurate way to render light. Also known as Path Tracing, this advanced ray tracing technique is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, full ray tracing in real-time video games was impossible.\nIn Black Myth: Wukong full ray tracing increases the fidelity and quality of lighting, reflections and shadows. Reflections on water reflect all surrounding detail. Water caustics add further realism, accurately rendering the refraction and reflection of light. Particles are reflected, making battles more dynamic and exciting. Fully ray-traced lighting ensures lighting indoors and outdoors is pixel perfect, darkening areas where light is occluded or doesn\u2019t reach, and realistically illuminating the world by bouncing light.

ConclusionNvidia - A company specialized in GPU (graphics processing unit) devices, has been attracting the attention of Wall Street investors recently. The halo effect of artificial intelligence (AI) along with its activities in the cryptocurrency mining sector have significantly contributed to Nvidia's success, driving the NVDA stock price to an all-time high.If Nvidia can maintain its current growth pace, it is expected to become the 6th company to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion. So, what has helped this company accelerate in such a competitive market? How has Nvidia's stock price performed in recent years? Let's explore this in more detail in the following article.1. Overview of Nvidia and the AI IndustryAccording to updated information from Wikipedia, Nvidia Corporation, or Nvidia, is a multinational American technology company founded on April 5, 1993 by Jensen Huang in Delaware and headquartered in Santa Clara, California.This is a software company specializing in the design of graphics processing units (GPUs) used for cloud computing, supercomputing, mobile computing, tablets, or entertainment and navigation systems. In addition, Nvidia has also expanded into areas such as data science, high-performance computing, and the automotive industry.However, the focus and the source of Nvidia's success lies in the GPU segment. Therefore, in the scope of this article, we will delve deeper into this aspect.To help you better understand the scale of Nvidia, let's take a look at some key financial figures. The data is taken from tradingview as of 2024.Nvidia's revenue in 2023 was approximately $26.97 billion; total assets were around $41.18 billion with a global workforce of approximately 26,196 employees.\u00a0With a market capitalization close to $2,35 trillion (as of 21/5/2024), Nvidia is currently ranked at the 4th after Microsoft and Apple\u00a0 and before Google\u00a0 (according to 8marketcap).Nvidia's market capitalization. Source: 8marketcapNvidia's earnings report estimates revenue of $24,59 billion in the first quarter-2024. The company also reported revenue of $22,10 billion in Q4/2023, $1,7 billion higher than expected and up 8,37% from the previous quarter.Sell\u00a0\u00a0BuyRegister and trade stock CFDs with 0 commission and low spreads! Trade Demo\u00a0with 50,000USD RISK-FREE virtual money\uff01According to Reuters, the company's stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) has risen more than 202% in 1 year. This has made it the 4th most valuable company in the United States according to the 8marketcap ranking.While Nvidia initially started as a company specializing in GPUs for video games, when people realized that GPUs could be used in the field of AI, it became a catalyst accelerating Nvidia's development. Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft began purchasing Nvidia chips to process their data.Even Elon Musk's electric vehicle company, Tesla, revealed in 2021 that it was using Nvidia's supercomputer chips to power the autonomous capabilities of its vehicles.Furthermore, the emergence of chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard has recently ignited a surge in generative AI. At this point, GPUs play a crucial role in AI by helping to accelerate the training of models and allowing them to learn from larger datasets.Nvidia itself is also actively engaged in R&D to release new GPU models that are said to run at double the speed of the previous generation. This is why people have high expectations for a bright future for Nvidia in the coming years.2. Are Nvidia stocks worth investing in?Nvidia has a technological advantage and a solid market position in the graphics card field, and its strong R&D investment and patent protection provide it with strong support. Financial data clearly shows that Nvidia's profitability is far superior to competitors like AMD and Intel, and its market share is also in a leading position. For the technology industry, the impact of financial market risks is quite large. Currently, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate hike cycle is nearing an end, and market concerns about corporate funding have also eased somewhat.Based on the collected information, there are a few perspectives to consider regarding investing in NVIDIA stock in 2024:The growth outlook for the artificial intelligence (AI) industry is very positive. The AI market is forecasted to grow rapidly in the coming decade, from $100 billion to nearly $20 trillion. NVIDIA is playing a major role in developing AI technology, such as providing the A100 chip for training ChatGPT models.NVIDIA is not only focused on the traditional PC gaming market, but has also expanded into applications like mobile computing, AI-based audio and video processing. This helps diversify the company's revenue streams.The strong growth of the cryptocurrency market using proof-of-work (PoW) technology could also drive demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, although the future of this segment remains uncertain.In summary, with the positive outlook for the AI industry and new applications, NVIDIA stock could be a consideration for investors in 2024. However, as with any investment, properly assessing risk and determining one's own risk tolerance is very important before making a decision.3. How much is NVIDIA stock (NASDAQ: NVDA)?The NVDA stock of Nvidia is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US. With such impressive performance, it's no surprise that Nvidia has made it into the Nasdaq 100, S&P 100, and S&P 500 indices. At the time of writing this, the NVDA stock is trading at $936,07, recording a 1,24% decrease in the last 24 hours.NVDA stock price. Source: TradingviewBased on the chart, we can see that:The Nvidia stock has reached its all-time high since its listing. Compared to the price of $0.82 in January 1999, the current NVDA price has increased by more than 214109%.The NVDA stock has formed a double-top pattern, with the most recent peak recorded on November 19, 2021, at $329.81. It's important to note that this was a period of overall financial market exuberance, when the price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) also reached an all-time high.However, the NVDA stock has also experienced a significant decline in value, reaching only $112.27 in October 2022.The underperformance of the NVDA stock in 2022 was a reflection of the broader macroeconomic challenges during that period. Nvidia's Q4 revenue declined 21% due to a downturn in the gaming segment. The cyclical nature of demand combined with high inflation rates eroded the purchasing power of gamers.Interestingly, this period also coincided with the dark times for many large cryptocurrency companies, such as the collapse of Terra and the disappearance of the FTX empire, which impacted numerous related entities and even led to the legal troubles of Sam Bankman-Fried.Fortunately, thanks to Nvidia's strong financial position, the temporary recession did not have a significant impact on the company's performance. The company still maintains a dominant 78% market share in discrete GPUs and retains its leadership position through technological innovation. Based on this, Nvidia's stock could continue to be an attractive option for investors.4.

How to buy NVIDIA Stocks? How to Efficiently Invest in NVIDIA Stocks?Investors have shown great interest in NVIDIA, a leading company in the field of AI and graphics processors. There are three common investment methods to consider when investing in NVIDIA stocks: directly buying stocks, through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and through contracts for difference (CFDs). Each method has its own unique advantages and risks:Investment methodInvestment Advantagesinvestment riskDirectly purchase NVDA\u00a0stocksTo purchase NVDA stocks, you need to open an account through a brokerage firm for trading; you can participate in the company's growth opportunities, and if the company distributes dividends, investors can also receive them;Requires relatively high starting capital and is fully exposed to fluctuations in the company\u2019s stock priceETFsMay include NVDA and other technology stocks, reducing the risk of relying on a single stockBecause multiple companies are involved, the impact of an outperformance of a single company such as NVDA on the overall portfolio may be dilutedCFDs tradingThere is no need to actually own the stock, and leverage can be used to amplify the investment effect; short selling is allowed when the stock price falls to profit from the market decline.High leverage means an increased potential risk of lossWhen comparing these three investment methods, directly buying stocks is suitable for those who want to hold long-term and directly benefit from the company's growth. ETFs are suitable for those seeking diversification and wanting to reduce the impact of single stock volatility.

The risks when investing in Nvidia stocksHere is an overview of the objective and subjective risks associated with Nvidia stock:Objective risks:The macroeconomic outlook is quite bleak. Due to the current global inflation, there has been a noticeable decrease in consumer spending, resulting in a significant decline in Nvidia's revenue. If inflation and economic recession worsen, it will pose significant challenges for Nvidia to counter the prevailing market conditions.Decrease in user demand: The majority of Nvidia's revenue is generated through the sale of graphics cards designed for gaming purposes. Nevertheless, it appears that this market is filled to capacity. While Nvidia is making efforts to venture into the field of AI, it's important to note that the transition to generating significant revenue from this sector will not occur immediately.Intense competition: Nvidia faces strong competition from other brands in this field. Rival companies like Intel, AMD, and Apple are steadily strengthening their presence, which is impacting Nvidia's market share and stock prices.Subjective risks:Nvidia has consistently maintained a low dividend rate since the end of 2018, in contrast to its competitors like Intel and Broadcom who have higher dividend rates.Nvidia's P/E ratio stands out among other technology companies like Apple and Intel, which has raised concerns about the valuation of its stock.7. ConclusionArtificial intelligence (AI) is currently a hot topic in the investment world, and many NVIDIA concept stocks have achieved good results in 2023 and 2024 on the back of this trend. However, it is worth noting that the gains of many concept stocks have already been very substantial, and whether their actual performance can support the high stock prices remains to be closely observed.However, from a long-term investment perspective, the transformation brought by artificial intelligence is just beginning, and the supply of NVIDIA's GPU products still cannot fully meet market demand. AI models like Sora, which convert text to video, will further drive market demand for related products. Therefore, in the long run, the NVIDIA stocks have a solid basis for actual performance growth. Investors should continue to pay attention to the development of this industry to benefit from it, but also exercise caution and diversification to manage the risks.FAQWhat Is the Long-Term Outlook for NVIDIA?Analysts\u2019 reports, market trends, and Nvidia\u2019s strategic initiatives in AI, gaming, and data centers can provide a future outlook.

A manufacturer of advanced semiconductors \u2013 particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) \u2013 Nvidia provides the hardware demanded by the latest artificial-intelligence-based protocols and platforms. So, NVDA stock on paper makes for an excellent long-term investment.Right now, the chipmaker enjoys a consensus Strong Buy assessment, breaking down as 33 Strong Buys, two Moderate Buys and four Holds. About the only area of concern that exists within this defined framework is that just a month ago, the overall assessment was slightly superior: 34 Strong Buys versus \u201conly\u201d 33. Advocates are likely losing little sleep over this hiccup.What\u2019s more, the average price target among experts stands at $141.29. There are slight variations regarding this target, depending on how sources calculate the forecasts, with some publications choosing to include averages that extend back only to a certain timeframe. Overall, though, the consensus is that NVDA should land somewhere north of $140.Currently, the most optimistic target calls for a price per share of $200. That\u2019s a target set by Rosenblatt Securities. Combined with the Barchart Technical Opinion indicator pegging NVDA stock a 56% Buy, retail investors may be tempted to jump on the bandwagon.After hitting a closing high of $135.58 on June 18, NVDA stock looks like it\u2019s on shaky ground. Yes, Wednesday\u2019s price action saw a massive surge of nearly 13%. However, NVDA still remains below the psychologically significant $120 level.With so much going on \u2013 and so much at stake \u2013 it\u2019s helpful to understand what the smart money might be doing.Options Flow: A Powerful Tool to Decipher NVDA Stock or Any Other SecurityOne of the most important tools that Barchart Premier members have access to is the full range of data found in its Options Flow screener. Unlike other popular derivative-market screeners such as unusual options activity, Options Flow focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional or professional traders.In other words, if an average retail trader buys one contract of an NVDA put or call, the Flow algorithm will ignore it. It\u2019s getting rid of all the white noise that everyday market data can easily create, especially for a popular entity like NVDA stock. Instead, it focuses solely on major transactions, making the information much more meaningful.BarchartEven better for Barchart users, the tool is constantly being improved. Right now, the screener automatically calculates the net trade sentiment for the day, which is the aggregation of premiums of options with bullish and bearish sentiment. Interestingly, while NVDA stock soared in the open market during the midweek session, net trade sentiment sat at $-38.8 million in favor of the bears.Drilling into the top five options with bearish sentiment, all of the derivatives were calls. By deduction, these were sold calls. Here, call sellers (or writers) are collecting the premium (or the price the bullish trader pays for buying the call) in the assumption that NVDA stock will not rise above the listed strike price.For the five calls, the strike prices range from $100 to $132. That\u2019s significant of course because as mentioned earlier, the average price target is $141.29. Apparently, the smart money does not believe that\u2019s in the cards for NVDA stock.A Warning, Not a GuaranteeJust like a \u201ccheck engine light\u201d in a vehicle, the implications behind the options flow screener doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. In a vehicle, the light could be indicative of something serious. Or it could be something very simple (i.e. cheap to fix) or even an electronic gremlin. In the case of the market, even the smartest traders make mistakes.Still, it\u2019s an invitation to conduct further investigation. For example, based on the size of the volume relative to open interest, the JAN 17 \u201925\u00a0132.00 Call warrants a closer look. It appears that a trade is being opened in that there are several bullish traders buying the $132 call. However, the smart money seems more than willing to sell that same option.If one were to read into this setup, it\u2019s possible that NVDA stock could march higher. However, the smart money doesn\u2019t seem to believe that Nvidia can set a new all-time closing high. Instead, it might chart a triple-top pattern.Students of technical analysis will understand that triple tops are bearish reversal patterns.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

They enhance user interactions through accurate understanding and improved responses based on local languages and cultural heritage.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region alone, generative AI software revenue is expected to reach $48 billion by 2030 \u2014 up from $5 billion this year, according to ABI Research.\nLlama-3-Swallow-70B, trained on Japanese data, and Llama-3-Taiwan-70B, trained on Mandarin data, are regional language models that provide a deeper understanding of local laws, regulations and other customs.\nThe RakutenAI 7B family of models, built on Mistral-7B, were trained on English and Japanese datasets, and are available as two different NIM microservices for Chat and Instruct. Rakuten\u2019s foundation and instruct models have achieved leading scores among open Japanese large language models, landing the top average score in the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark carried out from January to March 2024.\nTraining a large language model (LLM) on regional languages enhances the effectiveness of its outputs by ensuring more accurate and nuanced communication, as it better understands and reflects cultural and linguistic subtleties.\nThe models offer leading performance for Japanese and Mandarin language understanding, regional legal tasks, question-answering, and language translation and summarization compared with base LLMs like Llama 3.\nNations worldwide \u2014 from Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and Sweden to France, Italy and India \u2014 are investing in sovereign AI infrastructure.\nThe new NIM microservices allow businesses, government agencies and universities to host native LLMs in their own environments, enabling developers to build advanced copilots, chatbots and AI assistants.\nDeveloping Applications With Sovereign AI NIM Microservices\nDevelopers can easily deploy the sovereign AI models, packaged as NIM microservices, into production while achieving improved performance.\nThe microservices, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, are optimized for inference with the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM open-source library.\nNIM microservices for Llama 3 70B \u2014 which was used as the base model for the new Llama\u20133-Swallow-70B and Llama-3-Taiwan-70B NIM microservices \u2014 can provide up to 5x higher throughput. This lowers the total cost of running the models in production and provides better user experiences by decreasing latency.\nThe new NIM microservices are available today as hosted application programming interfaces (APIs).\nTapping NVIDIA NIM for Faster, More Accurate Generative AI Outcomes\nThe NIM microservices accelerate deployments, enhance overall performance and provide the necessary security for organizations across global industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education and legal.\nThe Tokyo Institute of Technology fine-tuned Llama-3-Swallow 70B using Japanese-language data.\n\u201cLLMs are not mechanical tools that provide the same benefit for everyone. They are rather intellectual tools that interact with human culture and creativity. The influence is mutual where not only are the models affected by the data we train on, but also our culture and the data we generate will be influenced by LLMs,\u201d said Rio Yokota, professor at the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. \u201cTherefore, it is of paramount importance to develop sovereign AI models that adhere to our cultural norms. The availability of Llama-3-Swallow as an NVIDIA NIM microservice will allow developers to easily access and deploy the model for Japanese applications across various industries.\u201d\nFor instance, a Japanese AI company, Preferred Networks, uses the model to develop a healthcare specific model trained on a unique corpus of Japanese medical data, called Llama3-Preferred-MedSwallow-70B, that tops scores on the Japan National Examination for Physicians.\nChang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH), one of the leading hospitals in Taiwan, is building a custom-made AI Inference Service (AIIS) to centralize all LLM applications within the hospital system. Using Llama 3-Taiwan 70B, it is improving the efficiency of frontline medical staff with more nuanced medical language that patients can understand.\n\u201cBy providing instant, context-appropriate guidance, AI applications built with local-language LLMs streamline workflows and serve as a continuous learning tool to support staff development and improve the quality of patient care,\u201d said Dr. Changfu Kuo, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at CGMH, Linko Branch. \u201cNVIDIA NIM is simplifying the development of these applications, allowing for easy access and deployment of models trained on regional languages with minimal engineering expertise.\u201d\nTaiwan-based Pegatron, a maker of electronic devices, will adopt the Llama 3-Taiwan 70B NIM microservice for internal- and external-facing applications. It has integrated it with its PEGAAi Agentic AI System to automate processes, boosting efficiency in manufacturing and operations.\nLlama-3-Taiwan 70B NIM is also being used by global petrochemical manufacturer Chang Chun Group, world-leading printed circuit board company Unimicron,\u00a0 technology-focused media company TechOrange, online contract service company LegalSign.ai and generative AI startup APMIC. These companies are also collaborating on the open model.\nCreating Custom Enterprise Models With NVIDIA AI Foundry\nWhile regional AI models can provide culturally nuanced and localized responses, enterprises still need to fine-tune them for their business processes and domain expertise.\nNVIDIA AI Foundry is a platform and service that includes popular foundation models, NVIDIA NeMo for fine-tuning, and dedicated capacity on NVIDIA DGX Cloud to provide developers a full-stack solution for creating a customized foundation model packaged as a NIM microservice.\nAdditionally, developers using NVIDIA AI Foundry have access to the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which provides security, stability and support for production deployments.\nNVIDIA AI Foundry gives developers the necessary tools to more quickly and easily build and deploy their own custom, regional language NIM microservices to power AI applications, ensuring culturally and linguistically appropriate results for their users.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | SoftwareTags: DGX Cloud | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NeMo | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Large language models are trained on vast amounts of data, but are typically general-purpose and contain excess information for most uses.\nSLMs, on the other hand, focus on specific use cases. So even with less data, they\u2019re capable of delivering more accurate responses, more quickly \u2014 critical elements for conversing naturally with digital humans.\nNemotron-4 4B was first distilled from the larger Nemotron-4 15B LLM. This process requires the smaller model, called a \u201cstudent,\u201d to mimic the outputs of the larger model, appropriately called a \u201cteacher.\u201d During this process, noncritical outputs of the student model are pruned or removed to reduce the parameter size of the model. Then, the SLM is quantized, which reduces the precision of the model\u2019s weights.\nWith fewer parameters and less precision, Nemotron-4 4B has a lower memory footprint and faster time to first token \u2014 how quickly a response begins \u2014 than the larger Nemotron-4 LLM while still maintaining a high level of accuracy due to distillation. Its smaller memory footprint also means games and apps that integrate the NIM microservice can run locally on more of the GeForce RTX AI PCs and laptops and NVIDIA RTX AI workstations that consumers own today.\nThis new, optimized SLM is also purpose-built with instruction tuning, a technique for fine-tuning models on instructional prompts to better perform specific tasks. This can be seen in Mecha BREAK, a video game in which players can converse with a mechanic game character and instruct it to switch and customize mechs.\nACEs Up\nACE NIM microservices allow developers to deploy state-of-the-art generative AI models through the cloud or on RTX AI PCs and workstations to bring AI to their games and applications. With ACE NIM microservices, non-playable characters (NPCs) can dynamically interact and converse with players in the game in real time.\nACE consists of key AI models for speech-to-text, language, text-to-speech and facial animation. It\u2019s also modular, allowing developers to choose the NIM microservice needed for each element in their particular process.\nNVIDIA Riva automatic speech recognition (ASR) processes a user\u2019s spoken language and uses AI to deliver a highly accurate transcription in real time. The technology builds fully customizable conversational AI pipelines using GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation microservices. Other supported ASRs include OpenAI\u2019s Whisper, a open-source neural net that approaches human-level robustness and accuracy on English speech recognition.\nOnce translated to digital text, the transcription goes into an LLM \u2014 such as Google\u2019s Gemma, Meta\u2019s Llama 3 or now NVIDIA Nemotron-4 4B \u2014 to start generating a response to the user\u2019s original voice input.\n\nNext, another piece of Riva technology \u2014 text-to-speech \u2014 generates an audio response. ElevenLabs\u2019 proprietary AI speech and voice technology is also supported and has been demoed as part of ACE, as seen in the above demo.\nFinally, NVIDIA Audio2Face (A2F) generates facial expressions that can be synced to dialogue in many languages. With the microservice, digital avatars can display dynamic, realistic emotions streamed live or baked in during post-processing.\nThe AI network automatically animates face, eyes, mouth, tongue and head motions to match the selected emotional range and level of intensity. And A2F can automatically infer emotion directly from an audio clip.\nFinally, the full character or digital human is animated in a renderer, like Unreal Engine or the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.\nAI That\u2019s NIMble\nIn addition to its modular support for various NVIDIA-powered and third-party AI models, ACE allows developers to run inference for each model in the cloud or locally on RTX AI PCs and workstations.\nThe NVIDIA AI Inference Manager software development kit allows for hybrid inference based on various needs such as experience, workload and costs. It streamlines AI model deployment and integration for PC application developers by preconfiguring the PC with the necessary AI models, engines and dependencies. Apps and games can then orchestrate inference seamlessly across a PC or workstation to the cloud.\nACE NIM microservices run locally on RTX AI PCs and workstations, as well as in the cloud. Current microservices running locally include Audio2Face, in the Covert Protocol tech demo, and the new Nemotron-4 4B Instruct and Whisper ASR in Mecha BREAK.\nTo Infinity and Beyond\nDigital humans go far beyond NPCs in games. At last month\u2019s SIGGRAPH conference, NVIDIA previewed \u201cJames,\u201d an interactive digital human that can connect with people using emotions, humor and more. James is based on a customer-service workflow using ACE.\nInteract with James at ai.nvidia.com.\nChanges in communication methods between humans and technology over the decades eventually led to the creation of digital humans. The future of the human-computer interface will have a friendly face and require no physical inputs.\nDigital humans drive more engaging and natural interactions.

This possible setback, coupled with the current negative sentiment around Nvidia, raises the question: should investors buy the dip in Nvidia stock ahead of earnings?Let\u2019s delve into the key factors to determine whether going long on Nvidia stock is a wise move or if a more cautious approach is warranted.Data Center to Drive Q3 FinancialsDespite macro and geopolitical challenges, artificial intelligence (AI)-led demand remains strong, which will likely boost Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenues significantly and its overall financials in Q2.In Q1 of fiscal 2025, Nvidia reported Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion, a sequential increase of 23% and a staggering year-on-year rise of 427%. This impressive growth was fueled by strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform, with compute revenue growing over fivefold and networking revenue tripling compared to the previous year.This growth trajectory is expected to continue into Q2. Nvidia\u2019s management has projected total revenue of approximately $28 billion for Q2, indicating a 107% year-over-year improvement. They anticipate sequential growth across all market platforms, with Data Center revenues being a primary driver.Notably, Nvidia\u2019s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are essential to many advanced generative AI applications. Further, consumer internet companies and enterprises, which account for about 50% of Data Center revenues, are ramping up their AI investments. These developments bode well for future growth. Consequently, Nvidia's Data Center compute revenue could deliver massive growth in Q2.The accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform is a key factor supporting Nvidia\u2019s top-line growth. Adding to the optimism, Nvidia\u2019s leadership highlighted during the Q1 conference call the extraordinary demand for GPUs in Data Centers. Applications such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and other multimodal AI systems are rapidly consuming available GPU resources. Additionally, a surge in generative AI startups is further driving demand.Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI is making inroads into various other sectors, spanning consumer internet companies, enterprises, sovereign AI projects, automotive sectors, and healthcare. This expansion creates a multibillion-dollar market for the company.In summary, Nvidia\u2019s strong position in the AI market and continued demand for its GPUs are set to drive substantial revenue growth. Higher sales and margin expansion will cushion its earnings per share (EPS), which analysts expect to more than double in Q2.\u00a0Nvidia has exceeded analysts\u2019 earnings forecast by an average of 23.99% in the past four quarters. As for Q2, analysts expect Nvidia to report earnings of $0.59 per share, up 136% year-over-year. Given the solid momentum in its business and margin expansion, Nvidia could once again deliver better-than-expected bottom-line results in Q2. Blackwell Delay Won't Impact Q2During the Q1 conference call, Nvidia\u2019s management confirmed that the Blackwell platform is in full production, with shipments beginning in Q2 and ramping up in Q3. Nvidia\u2019s leadership indicated that significant Blackwell revenue is anticipated this year. However, there are now concerns about a potential delay in the launch of the next-generation Blackwell platform, which could impact future performance.Despite this potential setback, Nvidia\u2019s Q2 financials and competitive positioning remain solid. Strong demand from cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and enterprises could continue to support its growth. Further, Nvidia\u2019s other products will likely enable the company to mitigate any revenue impact from the Blackwell delay.Nvidia Enhances Shareholders\u2019 ValueNvidia\u2019s solid financial performance has allowed the chip giant to return more cash to its shareholders. In Q1, Nvidia returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and cash dividends. Additionally, the company increased its dividend by 150%.At the end of Q1, Nvidia had over $31 billion in cash, and it generated $14.9 billion in free cash flow. Its solid financials and robust cash flow suggest that Nvidia can continue to enhance shareholder value through dividends and share repurchases.Analysts Are Upbeat on Nvidia StockAnalysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock ahead of Q2 earnings, and most of them suggest buying NVDA shares near the current market price.\u00a0Among 39 experts covering NVDA, 33 recommend a \u201cstrong buy,\u201d two suggest a \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and four have a \u201chold.\u201d Overall, Nvidia stock has a consensus rating of \u201cstrong buy.\u201dBarchartThe average price target for NVDA is $141.29, implying a roughly 40% potential upside from recent levels.On the date of publication, Sneha Nahata did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nThe initial wave of generative AI was driven by its use in internet services that showed incredible new possibilities with tools that could help people write, research and imagine faster than ever.\nThe second wave of generative AI is now here, powered by the availability of advanced open-source foundation models, as well as advancements in agentic AI that are improving efficiency and autonomy of AI workflows. Enterprises across industries can use models like Google Gemma, Llama 3.1 405B, Microsoft Phi, Mixtral and Nemotron to develop their own AI applications to support business growth and boost productivity.\nTo accelerate business transformation, enterprises need blueprints for canonical generative AI workflows like digital human customer service chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation and drug discovery. While NVIDIA NIM microservices help make these models efficient and accessible for enterprise use, building enterprise generative AI applications is a complex, multistep process.\nLaunched today, NVIDIA Blueprints include everything an enterprise developer needs to build and deploy customized generative AI applications that make a transformative\u00a0 impact on business objectives.\nBlueprints for Data-Driven Enterprise Flywheels\nNVIDIA Blueprints are reference AI workflows tailored for specific use cases. They include sample applications built with NVIDIA NIM and partner microservices, reference code, customization documentation and a Helm chart for deployment.\nWith NVIDIA Blueprints, developers can gain a head start on creating their own applications using NVIDIA\u2019s advanced AI tools and end-to-end development experience for each use case. The blueprints are designed to be modified and enhanced, and allow developers to leverage both information retrieval and agent-based workflows capable of performing complex tasks.\nNVIDIA Blueprints also help developers improve their applications throughout the AI lifecycle. As users interact with AI applications, new data is generated. This data can be used to refine and enhance the models in a continuous learning cycle, creating a data-driven generative AI flywheel.\nNVIDIA Blueprints help enterprises build their own generative AI flywheels with applications that link models with their data. NVIDIA NeMo facilitates this process, while NVIDIA AI Foundry serves as the production environment for running the flywheel.\nThe first NVIDIA Blueprints available are:\n\ndigital human for customer service\ngenerative virtual screening for accelerated drug discovery\nmultimodal PDF data extraction for enterprise RAG\n\nServiceNow is a leader in enterprise AI that has integrated advanced generative AI capabilities into its digital workflow platform. It\u2019s already bringing NIM microservices into its Now Assist AI solutions and working with the technologies featured in the digital human for customer service NIM Blueprint.\n\u201cAI is not just a tool, it\u2019s the foundation of a fundamental shift in how companies can better equip employees and serve customers,\u201d said Jon Sigler, senior vice president, Platform and AI at ServiceNow. \u201cThrough our collaboration with NVIDIA, we\u2019ve built new generative AI products and features that are driving growth and powering AI transformation for ServiceNow customers.\u201d\nMore NVIDIA Blueprints are in development for creating generative AI applications for customer service, content generation, software engineering, retail shopping advisors and R&D. NVIDIA plans to introduce new NVIDIA Blueprints monthly.\nNVIDIA Ecosystem Supercharges Enterprise Adoption\nNVIDIA\u2019s partner ecosystem \u2014 including global systems integrators and service delivery partners Accenture, Deloitte, SoftServe, Quantiphi and World Wide Technology \u2014 are bringing NVIDIA Blueprints to the world\u2019s enterprises.\nNVIDIA Blueprints can be optimized using customer interaction data with tools from NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem of partners, such as Dataiku and DataRobot for model fine-tuning, governance, and monitoring, deepset, LlamaIndex and Langchain for building workflows, Weights & Biases for generative AI application evaluations, and CrowdStrike, Datadog, Fiddler AI, New Relic and Trend Micro for additional safeguarding. Infrastructure platform providers, including Nutanix, Red Hat and Broadcom, will support NVIDIA Blueprints on their enterprise solutions.\nCustomers can build and deploy NVIDIA Blueprints on NVIDIA-Certified Systems from manufacturers such as Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo, as well as on NVIDIA-accelerated cloud instances from Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nTo help enterprises put their data to work in generative AI applications, NVIDIA Blueprints can integrate with data and storage platforms from NVIDIA partners, such as Cohesity, Datastax, Dropbox, NetApp and VAST Data.\nA Collaborative Future for Developers and Data Scientists\nGenerative AI is now fostering collaboration between developers and data scientists. Developers use NVIDIA Blueprints as a foundation to build their applications, while data scientists implement the data flywheel to continually improve their custom NIM microservices. As a NIM improves, so do the related applications, creating a cycle of continuous enhancement and data generation.\nWith NVIDIA Blueprints \u2014 and support from NVIDIA\u2019s partners \u2014 virtually every enterprise can seamlessly integrate generative AI into their applications to drive efficiency and innovation across industries.\nEnterprises can experience NVIDIA Blueprints today.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Millions of students worldwide are participating in university STEM programs to learn skills that will set them up for career success.\nTo prepare students for the future job market, NVIDIA has worked with top universities to develop a GPU-accelerated AI curriculum that\u2019s now taught in more than 5,000 schools globally. Students can get a jumpstart outside of class with NVIDIA\u2019s AI Learning Essentials, a set of resources that equips individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills and certifications for the rapidly evolving AI workforce.\nNVIDIA GPUs \u2014 whether running in university data centers, GeForce RTX laptops or NVIDIA RTX workstations \u2014 are accelerating studies, helping enhance the learning experience and enabling students to gain hands-on experience with hardware used widely in real-world applications.\n\nSupercharged AI Studies\nNVIDIA provides several tools to help students accelerate their studies.\nThe RTX AI Toolkit is a powerful resource for students looking to develop and customize AI models for projects in computer science, data science, and other STEM fields. It allows students to train and fine-tune the latest generative AI models, including Gemma, Llama 3 and Phi 3, up to 30x faster \u2014 enabling them to iterate and innovate more efficiently, advancing their studies and research projects.\nStudents studying data science and economics can use NVIDIA RAPIDS AI and data science software libraries to run traditional machine learning models up to 25x faster than conventional methods, helping them handle large datasets more efficiently, perform complex analyses in record time and gain deeper insights from data.\nAI-deal for Robotics, Architecture and Design\nStudents studying robotics can tap the NVIDIA Isaac platform for developing, testing and deploying AI-powered robotics applications. Powered by NVIDIA GPUs, the platform consists of NVIDIA-accelerated libraries, applications frameworks and AI models that supercharge the development of AI-powered robots like autonomous mobile robots, arms and manipulators, and humanoids.\nWhile GPUs have long been used for 3D design, modeling and simulation, their role has significantly expanded with the advancement of AI. GPUs are today used to run AI models that dramatically accelerate rendering processes.\nSome industry-standard design tools powered by NVIDIA GPUs and AI include:\n\nSOLIDWORKS Visualize: This 3D computer-aided design rendering software uses NVIDIA Optix AI-powered denoising to produce high-quality ray-traced visuals, streamlining the design process by providing faster, more accurate visual feedback.\nBlender: This popular 3D creation suite uses NVIDIA Optix AI-powered denoising to deliver stunning ray-traced visuals, significantly accelerating content creation workflows.\nD5 Render: Commonly used by architects, interior designers and engineers, D5 Render incorporates NVIDIA DLSS technology for real-time viewport rendering, enabling smoother, more detailed visualizations without sacrificing performance. Powered by fourth-generation Tensor Cores and the NVIDIA Optical Flow Accelerator on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs, DLSS uses AI to create additional frames and improve image quality.\nEnscape: Enscape makes it possible to ray trace more geometry at a higher resolution, at exactly the same frame rate. It uses DLSS to enhance real-time rendering capabilities, providing architects and designers with seamless, high-fidelity visual previews of their projects.\n\nBeyond STEM\nStudents, hobbyists and aspiring artists use the NVIDIA Studio platform to supercharge their creative processes with RTX and AI. RTX GPUs power creative apps such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Autodesk, Unity and more, accelerating a variety of processes such as exporting videos and rendering art.\n\nChatRTX is a demo app that lets students create a personalized GPT large language model connected to their own content and study materials, including text, images or other data. Powered by advanced AI, ChatRTX functions like a personalized chatbot that can quickly provide students relevant answers to questions based on their connected content. The app runs locally on a Windows RTX PC or workstation, meaning students can get fast, secure results personalized to their needs.\nNVIDIA ChatRTX user interface.\nSchools are increasingly adopting remote learning as a teaching modality. NVIDIA Broadcast \u2014 a free application that delivers professional-level audio and video with AI-powered features on RTX PCs and workstations \u2014 integrates seamlessly with remote learning applications including BlueJeans, Discord, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex and Zoom. It uses AI to enhance remote learning experiences by removing background noise, improving image quality in low-light scenarios, and enabling background blur and background replacement.\nNVIDIA Broadcast.\nFrom Data Centers to School Laptops\n\n @dannylum_ \nThe GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptops are perfect for your back to school all-in-one computer!

Despite recent declines, Nvidia stock surged 116% in 2024 and 130% over the past 12 months.\nWith a 629% increase in earnings per share but correspondingly high valuation multiples, there are questions about where this stock is headed. That said, many growth investors still feel Nvidia stock is trading at a justified valuation, given these sky-high growth rates.\nOthers question whether future growth will come in as anticipated or if Nvidia has simply pulled forward a significant chunk of true demand to past quarters. We\u2019ll have to see. However, the company\u2019s Blackwell architecture remains promising, and there are several growth catalysts investors have to like on the horizon.\nIndeed, many top tech stocks face short-term concerns, but Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects remain promising. Let\u2019s dive into why this stock still looks like a buy ahead of earnings.\nAnalysts Are Still Bullish on Nvidia Stock\nBarclays strategists have highlighted Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Q2 earnings report on August 28 as a potential catalyst for large-cap tech stocks. With recent market volatility and concerns over AI spending, Nvidia\u2019s results could influence the Big Tech landscape and investor sentiment about AI investments.\nBarclays deemed the 16% drop in European tech stocks and the 30% decline in key players like ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) excessive. Investors largely re-entered European tech with an overweight position, favoring this sector\u2019s long-term growth over struggling sectors like autos.\nRecent market volatility, driven by leveraged trades and shifting yen rates, caused sharp pullbacks. Barclays expects yen weakness to resume if global rate cuts accelerate but sees the recent sell-off as overdone, presenting opportunities for long-term investors.\nNVDA stock fell nearly 20% over the past month, but Mizuho sees significant upside ahead. Despite Blackwell chip delays, demand for Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200 remains strong. Analysts from Mizuho also raised Nvidia\u2019s price target to $132, showing a 26% potential gain.\nOther Wall Street analysts also believe Nvidia stock remains a strong buy, with a consensus average target price of $141.29 at the time of this writing. A number of top price target increases have been seen since May 2023 due to the company\u2019s incredible surging demand and the popularity of Nvidia\u2019s chips, which have led to strong earnings reports.\nBlackwell Delays Are Just Small Hurdles\nNvidia is delaying its next-gen Blackwell B200 AI chips by at least three months, with mass shipments now expected in early 2025. The delay, caused by a late-stage design flaw, has led to a drop in Nvidia\u2019s stock and broader AI investments. The company\u2019s B200 chips were slated to replace the successful H100, which has significantly boosted Nvidia\u2019s sales and stock.\nNvidia is testing new chips with Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) as several reports of delays continue to circulate. While Nvidia claims production is on track, a delay could impact its revenue and stock, affecting TSMC and rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\nCitigroup was among the analysts who lowered their 2025 revenue forecasts for the company and removed Nvidia from its catalyst watch due to the delay. Despite these prospective delays, Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips will maintain strong demand. Investors should view the current dip as a buying opportunity.\nWeigh The Good and Bad\nConcerns over Nvidia\u2019s market dominance and potential delays in its Blackwell chips are valid but varied in impact. Despite competition and regulatory scrutiny, Nvidia remains a leader in AI chips. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Nvidia for alleged market abuses, and delays are possible due to design flaws.\u00a0\nCEO Jensen Huang had previously projected strong revenue from Blackwell this year. The threat of reduced sales to China, especially with potential political changes, adds risk. However, Nvidia\u2019s valuation has stabilized below peak levels, and short-term demand for its chips remains strong, supported by ongoing AI investments from major tech firms.\nGiven ongoing tech volatility and strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips, gradually buying Nvidia stock in August appears to be a solid strategy. This is a company that long-term investors have not regretted dollar cost averaging into over time.\nYes, there are potential headwinds for the stock here. But buying NVDA stock on dips has been among the most profitable things to do for a long time, and I don\u2019t anticipate that will change soon.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in NVDA.\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Shares have gone from trading at levels below $100 earlier this month to around $124, as of this writing. That's approximately a 25% gain in a very short period. With so much change so fast, investors who bought the dip or who have been holding from much lower levels earlier this year may be debating whether it might make sense to take their profits and move on.\nThe decision about whether the stock should be sold at this level is not an easy one. The company, which creates graphic processing units (GPUs) powering the deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) craze, trades at 74 times earnings -- a high premium. But Nvidia's underlying business fundamentals are incredible; revenue in the company's most recent quarter soared 262% year over year, and earnings per share skyrocketed 629% over the same period.\nHere's a closer look at both the bull and bear cases for the stock to help investors decide for themselves what they should do.\n\nThe bull case\nInvestors bullish on the stock quickly point out that the company's impressive top-line growth is likely to persist for some time. This, bulls say, is evidenced by the fact that demand for the company's flagship H200 and Blackwell chips remains ahead of supply. Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress even noted in the company's most recent earnings call that the company expects demand for these products to \"exceed supply well into next year.\"\nFurther, Nvidia bulls might point to the company's revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter of 2025 to show how growth is continuing. Management forecast fiscal second-quarter revenue of $28 billion, a figure translating to more than a doubling of revenue and likely even faster earnings-per-share growth. Momentum like this will likely help quickly bring down Nvidia's high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bear case\nFundamental to the bear case for Nvidia stock is the fact that the market is forward looking -- particularly when dealing with stocks trading at high premium valuations. This means that Wall Street may severely punish Nvidia shares if it starts seeing evidence of potential future deterioration of revenue growth rates or earnings. A simple comment from management during an earnings call about demand and supply for Nvidia's key products getting closer to equilibrium, therefore, could spook investors and cause them to no longer believe the stock deserves a valuation multiple as high as it currently commands.\nFurther, what appears to be Nvidia's strength today -- its high profit margin -- is the same factor that makes it vulnerable. For instance, the company's gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 impressively expanded from 66.8% in the year-ago quarter to 78.9%. However, a higher-than-usual gross margin means normalization could occur in the future as demand catches up to supply and as competitors do a better job making competing products.\nIn an environment like this, Nvidia may have to lower the price of its products, and its margins could take a hit. This could lead to not only a slowdown in earnings but possibly even a decline.\nHeadwinds to Nvidia's margins and earnings growth (if they ever materialize) could be more than a year away. But a forward-looking market could start pricing in these risks any moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Nvidia seems like a great company, but a risky stock at this price. Selling shares and buying something more attractive may make sense.\n\n\n\nDaniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

That's because the company is viewed as a bellwether, or indicator, for the AI space and the overall market.\nNvidia dominates the rapidly growing AI chip market. If it delivers stronger-than-expected results -- particularly in its AI-driven data center business -- that suggests the broad AI market is probably more robust than widely believed.\nNvidia stock's performance has also become an indicator of the likely strength of the overall market. Nvidia is the second-largest stock on the S&P 500 index (behind Apple) and has been skyrocketing since early 2023, so it's been a huge driver of the index's overall performance.\nMy two-part prediction is that (1) Nvidia will beat Wall Street's earnings estimate, and (2) it will do so by at least 10%. We will get to where the 10% came from.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's Q2 guidance and Wall Street's estimates\n\n\n\nMetric\nQ2 Fiscal 2024 Result\nNvidia's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Guidance\nNvidia's Projected Growth\nWall Street's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Consensus Estimate\nWall Street's Projected Growth\n\n\nRevenue\n$13.51 billion\n$28 billion\n107%\n$28.68 billion\n112%\n\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$0.27*\n$0.622**\n130%\n$0.64\n137%\n\n\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo!

This data goes back to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended in late July 2020.

Finance, and YCharts.\nKey takeaways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimate in every quarter since generative AI became a major growth driver.\nNvidia's earnings beats, on average, have become larger in, let's call it, the generative AI era.\n\nPrediction: Nvidia will surpass Wall Street's earnings estimate by at least 10%\nLast quarter, Nvidia beat the Street's earnings estimate by 10%. In the last five quarters -- the generative AI era -- the company's earnings beat has generally decreased in size: 10% (most recent), 12%, 19%, 32%, and 18%. So, I'm using the smallest earnings beat as my prediction. I'm using the smallest and not, say, the average because of the trend in the data.\nThe bigger picture: Nvidia stock is likely not as pricey as it might seem\nSince generative AI entered the scene, Nvidia's earnings beats have become notably bigger (averaging 18%). I think this trend will continue.\nThe data in this article weakens the argument that goes something like: \"Nvidia stock is overvalued because its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is X.\" (The forward P/E is 46.2, as of Aug. 26.) A forward P/E uses an estimate for the earnings value, generally Wall Street's. And those estimates are likely notably too low, which inflates the forward P/E.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple and Nvidia.

Photograph: Chiang Ying-ying/APTechnology This article is more than 6 months oldNvidia rides big tech\u2019s AI investment to beat Wall Street\u2019s sky-high expectationsThis article is more than 6 months oldChipmaker, third most valuable company in world, records $30.04bn in revenue, showing AI demand continues to riseEdward HelmoreWed 28 Aug 2024 22.07 BSTFirst published on Wed 28 Aug 2024 21.30 BSTShareChipmaker Nvidia reported its latest financial results on Wednesday, recording $30.04bn in revenue over the past three months \u2013 a 122% jump from the year prior \u2013 and showing that artificial intelligence investment mania shows no signs of cooling.Analysts had anticipated about $28.7bn in revenue. Shares slid more than 3% in after-hours trading.In an earnings call, founder and CEO Jensen Huang said he expected Nvidia to ship \u201ca lot more\u201d chips and hardware next year than the company had in its 31-year history.\u201cThe reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to drive its costs down, and we want to increase the scale of AI models so that it will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and realize the next industrial revolution,\u201d he said.Analysts welcomed the results, despite signs that Nvidia\u2019s extraordinary sales growth might ultimately slow. \u201cThe company continues to benefit from a market paradox: big tech\u2019s aggressive AI investment strategies drive massive demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips, even as these same companies invest in developing their own silicon,\u201d said Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst with Emarketer.Nvidia has told customers that its next-generation AI chips, code-named Blackwell, will be delayed several months from January, though early samples are shipping to a small group of customers now. However, its current line of graphics processing units, nicknamed Hopper, continues to sell well, chief executive officer Jensen Huang said in a press release.\u201cHopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNvidia achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.\u201d The company\u2019s data center revenue, its most closely watched financial metric, increased by 154% from a year ago to $26.3bn.Recent earnings reports from Nvidia\u2019s main big tech customers \u2013 Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google \u2013 which use the company\u2019s chips to build and train their own AI models, indicated higher capital spending as AI demand continues to rise.\u201cAs competitors like AMD intensify their efforts, the timely release of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chip will be essential for maintaining its dominant position in the increasingly competitive AI chip market,\u201d said Bourne.The importance of Nvidia\u2019s earnings results to Wall Street can hardly be overestimated \u2013 the company represents 6% of the total value of the S&P 500, currently the third most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at $3.1tn.The index has gained 27% over the past 12 months, but Nvidia is individually up 167% over the same period. But because big tech is driving US stocks to new record highs, and because spending on Nvidia is seen as a signal of future tech earnings, Nvidia\u2019s results are a key barometer of the US stock market.The company also reported $0.68 in earnings per share and announced a $50bn stock buy-back. Analysts expected $0.64 per share for the quarter, compared to $13.5bn in revenue a year earlier. Profits were seen at $15.1bn, up from about $6.2bn a year earlier.The company\u2019s last earnings, released in May, showed quarterly growth of 18% and annual revenue growth of 262%. Against that extraordinary precedent, anything less than a repeat could be seen as a disappointment.The Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called Nvidia\u2019s earnings call \u201cthe most important week for the stock market this year and potentially in years\u201d. Ives estimates that for every $1 spent on an Nvidia GPU chip, there is a $8-$10 multiplier across the tech sector.\u201cIn a nutshell, we expect another drop-the-mic performance from Nvidia, as right now Jensen & Co are the only game in town with $1tn of AI cap-ex [capital expenditure] on the way for the next few years with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs the new oil and gold in this world,\u201d he added.The expectations are so high, in fact, that Ameriprise Financial\u2019s Anthony Saglimbene told Bloomberg that the results could have more impact on the overall market than Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech last week at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.But placing so much emphasis on a single stock itself rests on the concept that AI will boost global productivity over the coming decades.The enormous $100bn annual investment into AI has yet to translate into profits for big tech, and its not yet clear when they will arrive. Conversely, a disappointing set of results could leads to doubts \u2013 and that we are at peak AI hype.Nvidia reports stratospheric growth as AI boom shows no sign of stoppingRead moreThat\u2019s led to comparisons to the late 1999 Internet bubble when the sector crashed but later recovered as the online world we know today on its skeletal remains.In his market hand-holding mode, Ives said in a note that investors may worry about the huge spending, but the circumstances are more like 1995, when investment was pouring into the internet\u2019s infrastructure, and not like 1999 when the bubble burst.\u201cTech earnings season has only bolstered and validated this bullish view of tech stocks heading into year-end and 2025,\u201d Ives says.As with Microsoft in the early 2000s, regulators are hovering over Nvidia. Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation into the tech giant. Rival chipmakers have alleged the company has abused its market dominance to corner the market and coerce its customers into continuing to purchase its products.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyNvidia shares slump amid reports US is ramping up antitrust investigation4 Sept 2024Nvidia shares fall on slowing growth and production concerns29 Aug 2024Why have the big seven tech companies been hit by AI boom doubts?3 Aug 2024Can AI boom drive Nvidia to a $4tn valuation despite investor doubt?2 Jul 2024Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia investigated over monopoly laws6 Jun 2024Nvidia: what\u2019s so good about the tech firm\u2019s new AI superchip?19 Mar 2024Why has Nvidia driven stock markets to record highs?23 Feb 2024US orders immediate halt to some AI chip exports to China, says Nvidia25 Oct 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As the Galactic Empire relentlessly pursues the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance, the criminal underworld thrives. Fans will play as cunning scoundrel Kay Vess and her loyal companion Nix, as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen. Seeking the means to start a new life, players will join Kay and Nix as they fight, steal, and outwit their way through the galaxy\u2019s crime syndicates and join the galaxy\u2019s most wanted.\nKay and Nix can turn any situation to their advantage: use stealth and gadgets to gain the upper hand, use Nix to distract and draw away enemies, or engage in blaster combat in tense situations throughout their journey. In order to pull off the ultimate heist, Kay and Nix will search for and join forces with a cast of outlaws, including battle-hardened droid ND-5. While stealing valuable goods, infiltrating secret locations, and outwitting enemies, they will need to carefully consider how their choices affect their status with each syndicate, as each move will influence Kay\u2019s ever-changing reputation.\nSTAR WARS TM & \u00a9 2024 Lucasfilm Ltd.

Nvidia (NVDA) earnings are due out after hours, which could help break the stagnant trading conditions in U.S. equity index futures during the first two days of the week. Ahead of time, the AI narrative is under pressure as Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced accounting-related issues. Bonds are floating higher over the session, although the stronger U.S. dollar is proving a formidable challenge today for precious metals.\u00a0\n\nSymbol: Equities\u00a0Daily Change\u00a0/ESU4\u00a0-0.11%\u00a0/NQU4\u00a0-0.22%\u00a0/RTYU4\u00a0-0.44%\u00a0/YMU4\u00a0-0.05%\u00a0\nNasdaq futures (/NQU4) were slightly lower this morning, down about 0.17% ahead of the New York open. All eyes are on Nvidia\u2019s earnings, which are due today after the close of the market. Nordstrom (JWN) rose 2% in pre-market trading after the luxury retailer posted better-than-expected earnings. Ambarella (AMBA), the fabless chip maker, rose over 20% ahead of the open after beating revenue estimates and guiding higher for the next quarter. Bank of America (BAC) fell 1% after a filing showed that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) continued to offload shares.\u00a0\u00a0Super Micro Computer (SMCI) announced it will miss the deadline to file its annual report on Form 10-K. The delay occurred because the company is reassessing its controls over financial reporting after Hindenburg Research said it identified red flags in its accounting procedures. SMCI is down over 10% in pre-market trading.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStrategy: (51DTE, ATM)\u00a0Strikes\u00a0POP\u00a0Max Profit\u00a0Max Loss\u00a0Iron Condor\u00a0\u00a0Long 17750 p\u00a0Short 18000 p\u00a0Short 21250 c\u00a0Long 21500 c\u00a068%\u00a0+1010\u00a0-3990\u00a0Short Strangle\u00a0Short 18000 p\u00a0Short 21250 c\u00a073%\u00a0+4460\u00a0x\u00a0Short Put Vertical\u00a0Long 17750 p\u00a0Short 18000 p\u00a089%\u00a0+445\u00a0-4555\u00a0Symbol: Bonds\u00a0Daily Change\u00a0/ZTZ4\u00a00%\u00a0/ZFZ4\u00a0+0.01%\u00a0/ZNZ4\u00a0+0.04%\u00a0/ZBZ4\u00a0+0.08%\u00a0/UBZ4\u00a0+0.16%\u00a0There isn\u2019t too much movement in the Treasury market this morning, although prices across the curve are slightly lower at the New York open. Tomorrow\u2019s update to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and Friday\u2019s inflation numbers could introduce some volatility, but trading volume remains light this week, which is normal ahead of the holiday weekend.

That allows more time to adjust or close, but also means a lower annualized return.As a reminder, a bull put spread is a bullish trade that also can benefit from a drop in implied volatility.The maximum profit for a bull put spread is limited to the premium received while the maximum potential loss is also capped. To calculate the maximum loss, take the difference in the strike prices of the long and short options, and subtract the premium received.Implied volatility is currently sitting at 63.71% which gives NVDA and IV Percentile of 90% and an IV Rank of 54%.Keep in mind Nvidia is due to report earnings on August 28th.When entering credit spreads such as a bull put spread, it\u2019s better to look for a stock with a high implied volatility percentage.To create a bull put spread, we sell an out-of-the-money put and then by a put further out-of-the-money.If we go out to December, we could sell the December 20 put with a strike price of $85 and buy the $80 put, which would create a bull put spread.This spread was trading yesterday for around $0.80. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $800 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $420.That represents a 19% return on risk between now and December 20 if NVDA stock remains above $85.If NVDA stock closes below $80 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $420.The breakeven point for the bull put spread is $84.20 which is calculated as $85 less the $0.80 option premium per contract.That breakeven price is around 28.7% below yesterday\u2019s closing price.\u00a0Conclusion And Risk ManagementOne way to set a stop loss for a bull put spread is based on the premium received. In this case, we received $80, so we could set a stop loss equal to the premium received, or a loss of around $80.Another way to manage the trade is to set a point on the chart where the trade will be adjusted or closed. That could be if the stock breaks through the key level of $100.Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.\u00a0This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose over 2% in premarket trading, with other megacap \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks also seeing sharp rebounds. \nOn a year-to-date basis, NVDA stock is still up more than 100%, though it\u2019s down considerably from its recent peak, shedding more than $650 billion from its peak market capitalization at the time of writing.\nThere are several reasons for Nvidia\u2019s recent drop that are worth discussing. The company announced a three-month delay on its next generation chips. This might push other megacap tech stocks to develop their own chips internally at a faster rate.\nSome analysts have warned that missing sales during this crucial period could hurt Nvidia\u2019s valuation. It appears that\u2019s already happened, and now the question is whether these headwinds are fully priced into this semiconductor stock right now.\nLet\u2019s dive into this question and see whether we can form an opinion one way or another. \nChip Production and Delay Problems\nA highly popular GPU among gamers is Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 3060, recently named the best GPU under $300. Sadly, reports say the model might be discontinued soon. \nAn insider from Bobatang forums revealed Nvidia is ending production and notifying manufacturers about the last opportunity to order the RTX 3060.\nEven if the RTX 3060 is indeed being discontinued, it won\u2019t vanish from stores immediately. Nvidia typically continues sales for a few months post-announcement. \nThe end of production is significant, as it holds 5.88% market share, skyrocketing pass the GTX 1650, which holds 4%.\nIn other news, Nvidia\u2019s \u201cBlackwell\u201d B200 AI chips will be delayed by at least three months due to a late-stage design flaw, sources reported. \nThe B200 chips, successors to the highly sought-after H100, will now ramp up production in the second half the year.\nNvidia is delaying Blackwell chip shipments until Q1, working through tests with TSMC. Microsoft, Google, and Meta have placed huge orders. The chips were expected to launch in 2024, starting Nvidia\u2019s annual AI chip releases.\nAI Spending\nNVDA stock has been volatile, fluctuating with market movements. On Aug. 2, it rose following the FOMC meeting hinting at a potential rate cut and positive news from Microsoft increasing AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia benefited from this news. \nAdditionally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced plans to boost AI spending through 2025, further aiding fuel to the Nvidia momentum rally we saw form in between various dips.\nDespite Meta\u2019s positive AI news, disappointing economic data overshadowed these tailwinds. Jobless rates are higher in the U.S. now (though recent jobless claims data complicates the trajectory), leading to a market downturn in recent weeks. \nNVDA might also see a drop post-earnings if guidance will disappoint, even if it beats estimates. ROI concerns on AI spending loom, but Nvidia\u2019s CFO plans to address these with positive metrics. \nGoldman Sachs remains confident in Nvidia\u2019s leadership and expects Q2 results to surpass estimates.\nNvidia\u2019s Q1 revenue soared 262% to $26 billion, with earnings per share up 629% to $5.98. Q2 revenue is estimated at $28 billion, potentially setting another record. Analysts expect $28.4 billion. \nWith AMD\u2019s strong Q2 and increased AI spending from Microsoft and Meta, NVIDIA is poised for another significant quarter.\nAnalysts Remain Bullish\nNvidia gained 3.8% to $104.25 Tuesday, rebounding with the market after Monday\u2019s sell-off and easing fears about chip delays. Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer highlighted Nvidia\u2019s solid AI positioning despite minor delays. \nAnalysts believe the company\u2019s Hopper chips will mitigate issues, maintaining a $150 target price for the stock.\nOn Tuesday, NewStreet\u2019s Pierre Ferragu upgraded NVDA stock to Buy with a $120 target, citing delays in Blackwell chips as easing supply issues.\nHe noted that higher spending on current Hopper chips would benefit Nvidia. Susquehanna\u2019s Mehdi Hosseini downplayed major delays, stating that yields and forecasts for Blackwell chips remained stable.\nMany analysts and experts still view AI as a strong trade, suggesting the current dip is a buying opportunity. I believe Nvidia\u2019s leadership in high-performance chips positions it for long-term growth. \nOf course, near-term dips can materialize and likely will over the coming months. But there\u2019s a reason Nvidia has turned out to be a long-term gem for investors who have been patient.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nEvery month brings new creative app updates and optimizations powered by the NVIDIA Studio platform \u2014 supercharging creative processes with NVIDIA RTX and AI.\nRTX-powered video editing app CyberLink PowerDirector now has a setting for high-efficiency video encoding (HEVC). 3D artists can access new features and faster workflows in Adobe Substance 3D Modeler and SideFX: Houdini. And content creators using Topaz Video AI Pro can now scale their photo and video touchups faster with NVIDIA TensorRT acceleration.\nThe August Studio Driver is ready to install via the NVIDIA app beta \u2014 the essential companion for creators and gamers \u2014 to keep GeForce RTX PCs up to date with the latest NVIDIA drivers and technology.\nAnd this week\u2019s featured In the NVIDIA Studio artist Stavros Liaskos is creating physically accurate 3D digital replicas of Greek Orthodox churches, holy temples, monasteries and other buildings using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for building and connecting Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) apps.\nDiscover the latest breakthroughs in graphics and generative AI by watching the replay of NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s firechat chats with Lauren Goode, senior writer at WIRED, and Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg at SIGGRAPH.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a Creative App for That\nThe NVIDIA NVENC video encoder is built into every RTX graphics card, offloading the compute-intensive task of video encoding from the CPU to a dedicated part of the GPU.\nCyberLink PowerDirector, a popular video editing program that recently added support for RTX Video HDR, now has a setting to increase HEVC with NVIDIA NVENC HEVC Ultra-High-Quality mode.\nThe new functionality reduces bit rates and improves encoding efficiency by 10%, significantly boosting video quality. Using the custom setting, content creators can offer audiences superior viewing experiences.\nEncoding efficiency jumps by 55% with just a few clicks.\nAlpha exporting allows users to add overlay effects to videos by exporting HEVC video with an alpha channel. This technique can be used to create transparent backgrounds and rapidly process animated overlays, making it ideal for creating social media content.\nWith an alpha channel, users can export HEVC videos up to 8x faster compared with run-length encoding supported by other processors, and with a 100x reduction in file size.\nAdobe Substance 3D Modeler, a multisurface 3D sculpting tool for artists, virtual effects specialists and designers, released Block to Stock, an AI-powered, geometry-based feature for accelerating the prototyping of complex shapes.\nIt allows rough 3D shapes to be quickly replaced with pre-existing, similarly shaped 3D models that have greater detail. The result is a highly detailed shape crafted in no time.\nThe recently released version 20.5 of SideFX: Houdini, a 3D procedural software for modeling, animation and lighting, introduced NVIDIA OptiX 8 and NVIDIA\u2019s Shader Execution Reordering feature to its Karma XPU renderer \u2014 exclusively on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nWith these additions, computationally intensive tasks can now be executed up to 4x faster on RTX GPUs.\nTopaz Video AI Pro, a photo and video enhancement software for noise reduction, sharpening and upscaling, added TensorRT acceleration for multi-GPU configurations, enabling parallelization across multiple GPUs for supercharged rendering speeds \u2014 up to 2x faster with two GPUs over a single GPU system, with further acceleration in systems with additional GPUs.\n\nVirtual Cultural Sites to G(r)eek Out About\nAnyone can now explore over 30 Greek cultural sites in virtual reality, thanks to the immersive work of Stavros Liaskos, managing director of visual communications company Reyelise.\n\u201cMany historical and religious sites are at risk due to environmental conditions, neglect and socio-political issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBy creating detailed 3D replicas, we\u2019re helping to ensure their architectural splendor is preserved digitally for future generations.\u201d\nLiaskos dedicated the project to his father, who passed away last year.\n\u201cHe taught me the value of patience and instilled in me the belief that nothing is unattainable,\u201d he said. \u201cHis wisdom and guidance continue to inspire me every day.\u201d\nChurches are architecturally complex structures. To create physically accurate 3D models of them, Liaskos used the advanced real-time rendering capabilities of Omniverse, connected with a slew of content-creation apps.\n\nThe OpenUSD framework enabled a seamless workflow across the various apps Liaskos used. For example, after using Trimble X7 for highly accurate 3D scanning of structures, Liaskos easily moved to Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender for modeling and animation.\nThen, with ZBrush, he sculpted intricate architectural details on the models and refined textures with Adobe Photoshop and Substance 3D. It was all brought together in Omniverse for real-time lighting and rendering.\nInterior rendering of the Panagia Xrysospiliotissa Church in Athens, Greece.\nFor post-production work, like adding visual effects and compiling rendered scenes, Liaskos used OpenUSD to transfer his projects to Adobe After Effects, where he finalized the video output. Nearly every element of his creative workflow was accelerated by his NVIDIA RTX A4500 GPU.\u00a0\nInterior scene of the Church of Saint Basil on Metsovou Street in Athens.\nLiaskos also explored developing extended reality (XR) applications that allow users to navigate his 3D projects in real time in virtual reality (VR).\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-2-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nFirst, he used laser scanning and photogrammetry to capture the detailed geometries and textures of the churches.\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/studio-itns-stavros-liaskos-wk121-agios-eleftherios-1-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nThen, he tapped Autodesk 3ds Max and Maxon ZBrush for retopology, ensuring the models were optimized for real-time rendering without compromising detail.\nAfter importing them into NVIDIA Omniverse with OpenUSD, Liaskos packaged the XR scenes so they could be streamed to VR headsets\u00a0 using either the NVIDIA Omniverse Create XR spatial computing app or Unity Engine, enabling immersive viewing experiences.\n\u201cThis approach will even more strikingly showcase the architectural beauty and cultural significance of these sites,\u201d Liaskos said. \u201cThe simulation must be as good as possible to recreate the overwhelming, impactful feeling of calm and safety that comes with visiting a deeply spiritual space.\u201d\nCreator Stavros Liaskos.\nThe project is co-funded by the European Union within the framework of the operational program Digital Transformation 2021-2027 for the Greek Holy Archbishopric of Athens.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, X and Facebook.

However, some caution is advisable, as Raymond James recently highlighted concerns about Nvidia\u2019s chart setup, suggesting potential technical headwinds that could affect short-term price movements.With Nvidia's quarterly earnings slated for August, the stakes are high. In this article, we will delve into Nvidia\u2019s recent developments, financials, valuation, growth prospects, and sentiment in the options market, evaluating whether the stock is a prudent buy in the lead-up to its next earnings release.About Nvidia StockBased in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a premier technology firm known for its expertise in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The company is renowned for its pioneering contributions to gaming, data centers, and AI-driven applications. Its market cap currently stands at $2.87 trillion.While the stock is now down about 17% from its June intraday peak of over $140, shares of Nvidia have still skyrocketed roughly 142% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the broader market. Recent Launches from NvidiaOn July 29, Nvidia unveiled significant enhancements to Universal Scene Description, or OpenUSD, aimed at broadening its use in robotics, industrial design, and engineering. These advancements will speed up developers' capacity to create highly precise virtual worlds, paving the way for the next evolution of AI.On July 23, Nvidia launched its new NVIDIA AI Foundry service and NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, designed to enhance generative AI for global enterprises using the openly available Llama 3.1 model collection. NVIDIA AI Foundry enables enterprises and nations to develop custom \u201csupermodels\u201d tailored to their specific industry use cases, utilizing Llama 3.1 alongside NVIDIA's software, computing, and expertise. Enterprises can train these supermodels using both proprietary data and synthetic data generated from Llama 3.1\u00a0405B and the NVIDIA Nemotron Reward model.In June, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE and Nvidia introduced NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE, a jointly developed portfolio of AI solutions and go-to-market integrations, designed to help enterprises accelerate the adoption of generative AI. A standout feature of the portfolio is HPE Private Cloud AI, a pioneering solution that offers the most comprehensive integration yet of NVIDIA AI computing, networking, and software with HPE\u2019s AI storage, computing capabilities, and the HPE GreenLake cloud.Also in June, Nvidia introduced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a suite of microservices designed to facilitate physically accurate sensor simulation, accelerating the development of fully autonomous machines across various applications.Nvidia Works on a Flagship AI Chip for Chinese MarketIn March, the AI chip giant unveiled its \u201cBlackwell\u201d chip series, which is scheduled for mass production later in the year. The new processors feature two silicon squares, each the size of the company's previous models. Within the series, the B200 processor performs certain tasks, such as delivering responses from chatbots, up to 30 times faster than its predecessor.\u00a0On July 22, Reuters reported that Nvidia is developing a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market, designed to comply with current U.S. export controls.Nvidia plans to collaborate with Inspur, one of its major distribution partners in China, on the launch and distribution of the chip, tentatively named the \u201cB20,\u201d according to two sources who spoke to Reuters. A separate source informed Reuters that shipments of the \u201cB20\u201d are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2025.Notably, China has long been a significant market for Nvidia, contributing about 17% of its revenue as of January this year - down from 26% two years prior, due to U.S. sanctions. In light of this, the introduction of the \u201cB20\u201d chip is an effort to regain market share and strengthen Nvidia\u2019s position in China.Analysts Are Bullish Ahead of Nvidia\u2019s Q2 ResultsOn July 31, Morgan Stanley named Nvidia a top U.S. chip stock pick, and said recent weakness in the stock provides a \u201cgood entry point.\u201d The firm kept an \"Overweight' rating on the stock with a $144 price target.Prior to that, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar on July 22 raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $140 from $120, and reiterated an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating. The analyst stated that, despite recent volatility, the bull case for Nvidia stock remains intact: \u201cWe view the setup for Nvidia positively ahead of the July-quarter earnings and the October-quarter guidance,\" Kumar said in a client note. \u201cWe see the strong business trends exhibited over the prior year by Nvidia set to continue, aided by the official launch of the Blackwell architecture in the October quarter.\u201d Separately, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on NVDA stock to $175 from $120 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating.Additionally, as noted by On the Pulse investor on July 21, \u201cNvidia\u2019s valuation is actually not excessive at all.\u201d Despite recognizing the rapid growth, the investor remains optimistic about NVDA\u2019s future prospects, particularly in its data center business. The investor argues that the company\u2019s status as the undisputed leader in the AI processor market positions it for continued gains well into the future, believing that \u201cNvidia\u2019s AI growth curve is just getting started.\u201d As a result, On the Pulse confidently rates Nvidia shares as a \u201cBuy.\u201d\u00a0However, Raymond James analyst Javed Mirza said in a note on July 26 that Nvidia\u2019s stock could continue to decline in the short term, potentially dropping another 16% to $94.94 per share. Mirza pointed out that Nvidia has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d according to a moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) indicator that monitors price momentum. He also emphasized that Nvidia\u2019s price is falling below its 50-day moving average and showing initial signs of selling pressure, indicating a potential intermediate-term correction phase lasting about 1-3 months.How Did Nvidia Perform in Q1?On May 22, Nvidia reported quarterly results and guidance that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations, propelling its shares to a gain of over 9% in the subsequent trading session.\u00a0The company reported record revenue of $26.0 billion in the first quarter, an 18% increase from the previous quarter and a 262% increase year-over-year, significantly exceeding its own outlook of $24 billion and Wall Street's consensus of $24.59 billion. Data Center revenue, which represented approximately 87% of total revenue, reached a record $22.6 billion, marking a 23% sequential increase and a 427% year-over-year growth. This figure exceeded estimates of $21.13 billion, driven by sustained strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform.\u00a0Gaming revenue increased by 18% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, aligning with estimates. Automotive revenue for the period totaled $329 million, and professional visualization revenue rose 45% year-over-year to $427 million.\u201cOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.During the earnings conference call, Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NVIDIA, mentioned that the company anticipates continued growth opportunities as generative AI expands into more consumer Internet applications.Meanwhile, the company\u2019s earnings per share came in at $0.61, comfortably beating analysts\u2019 expectations. Its adjusted gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.9% on lower inventory targets.It\u2019s also noteworthy that the company returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the first quarter. Notably, Nvidia raised its quarterly cash dividend by 150%.Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, management anticipates that the company will generate $28 billion in revenue, with a possible variance of plus or minus 2%. Adjusted gross margin is projected to be approximately 75.5%, with a potential variation of plus or minus 50 basis points, and adjusted operating expenses are expected to be around $2.8 billion.The company is set to announce its fiscal Q2 earnings results after the market closes on Wednesday, Aug. 28. Analysts tracking Nvidia forecast a 136% year-over-year increase in its earnings to $0.59 per share for fiscal Q2 of 2025, with revenue expected to rise 110.91% year-over-year to $28.49 billion. Notably, NVDA has consistently exceeded Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates in its last four quarterly reports.Is NVDA Stock Overvalued?Assessing Nvidia\u2019s valuation, the stock is currently trading at 37.86 times the consensus earnings estimate for FY25, which is higher than the sector median of 24.57x, but still below its five-year average of 47.03x.\u00a0Additionally, NVDA\u2019s forward non-GAAP PEG ratio of 1.13 is approximately 39% lower than the sector median of 1.86, and significantly below its five-year average of 2.12.Therefore, considering its growth prospects, NVDA does not seem to be overvalued.Options Market Sentiment on Nvidia Stock\u00a0Examining the August 30,\u00a02024, option chain, there is a bid/ask spread of $9.20/$9.50 for the $117.00 CALL option and $8.10/$8.80 for the $117.00 PUT option. Remember, this is the options strike nearest to the current stock price. We can estimate the anticipated earnings price movement by using the midpoint prices of these options:8.45 (117.00 put) + 9.35 (117.00 call) = 17.80/117.02 = 15.2%Based on current prices, the options market suggests that NVDA stock could potentially rise or fall by approximately 15% from the $117.00 strike price by the August options expiration, using the long straddle strategy. That would place the stock in a trading range of about $99.23 to $134.80.\u00a0Additionally, the ratio of open calls to open puts at the $117.00 strike price is approximately 1.43 to 1, with 1,293 open calls compared to 902 open puts. This reflects a bullish sentiment in the options market and suggests a greater probability of the stock's price increasing.What Do Analysts Expect For NVDA Stock?Nvidia stock has a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating. Out of the 39 analysts covering the stock, 33 recommend a \u201cStrong Buy,\u201d two advise \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and the remaining four have a \u201cHold\u201d rating. The average analyst price target of $141.29 indicates a potential upside of about 20.7% from current price levels. The Bottom Line on NVDA StockAll things considered, I believe Nvidia is a solid buy candidate ahead of its next earnings release. Nvidia stock still has potential for growth due to the significant opportunities in GPU sales for data centers, even following the stock\u2019s impressive year-to-date rally.\u00a0Also, the recent drop in Nvidia\u2019s stock presents an excellent buying opportunity for those wary of its high valuation. Finally, sentiment in the options market reinforces the overall bullish outlook for the company.On the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

This integration allows you to deploy industry-leading large language models (LLMs) on SageMaker and optimize their performance and cost. The optimized prebuilt containers enable the deployment of state-of-the-art LLMs in minutes instead of days, facilitating their seamless integration into enterprise-grade AI applications.\nNIM is built on technologies like NVIDIA TensorRT, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, and vLLM. NIM is engineered to enable straightforward, secure, and performant AI inferencing on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated instances hosted by SageMaker. This allows developers to take advantage of the power of these advanced models using SageMaker APIs and just a few lines of code, accelerating the deployment of cutting-edge AI capabilities within their applications.\nNIM, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform listed on AWS Marketplace, is a set of inference microservices that bring the power of state-of-the-art LLMs to your applications, providing natural language processing (NLP) and understanding capabilities, whether you\u2019re developing chatbots, summarizing documents, or implementing other NLP-powered applications. You can use pre-built NVIDIA containers to host popular LLMs that are optimized for specific NVIDIA GPUs for quick deployment. Companies like Amgen, A-Alpha Bio, Agilent, and Hippocratic AI are among those using NVIDIA AI on AWS to accelerate computational biology, genomics analysis, and conversational AI.\n\nIn this post, we provide a walkthrough of how customers can use generative artificial intelligence (AI) models and LLMs using NVIDIA NIM integration with SageMaker. We demonstrate how this integration works and how you can deploy these state-of-the-art models on SageMaker, optimizing their performance and cost.\nYou can use the optimized pre-built NIM containers to deploy LLMs and integrate them into your enterprise-grade AI applications built with SageMaker in minutes, rather than days. We also share a sample notebook that you can use to get started, showcasing the simple APIs and few lines of code required to harness the capabilities of these advanced models.\nSolution overview\nGetting started with NIM is straightforward. Within the NVIDIA API catalog, developers have access to a wide range of NIM optimized AI models that you can use to build and deploy your own AI applications. You can get started with prototyping directly in the catalog using the GUI (as shown in the following screenshot) or interact directly with the API for free.\n\nTo deploy NIM on SageMaker, you need to download NIM and subsequently deploy it. You can initiate this process by choosing Run Anywhere with NIM for the model of your choice, as shown in the following screenshot.\n\nYou can sign up for the free 90-day evaluation license on the API Catalog by signing up with your organization email address. This will grant you a personal NGC API key for pulling the assets from NGC and running on SageMaker. For pricing details on SageMaker, refer to Amazon SageMaker pricing.\n\nPrerequisites\nAs a prerequisite, set up an Amazon SageMaker Studio environment:\n\nMake sure the existing SageMaker domain has Docker access enabled. If not, run the following command to update the domain:\n\n\n# update domain\naws --region region \\\n    sagemaker update-domain --domain-id domain-id \\\n    --domain-settings-for-update '{\"DockerSettings\": {\"EnableDockerAccess\": \"ENABLED\"}}'\n\n\nAfter Docker access is enabled for the domain, create a user profile by running the following command:\n\n\naws --region region sagemaker create-user-profile \\\n    --domain-id domain-id \\\n    --user-profile-name user-profile-name\n\n\nCreate a JupyterLab space for the user profile you created.\nAfter you create the JupyterLab space, run the following bash script to install the Docker CLI.\n\nSet up your Jupyter notebook environment\nFor this series of steps, we use a SageMaker Studio JupyterLab notebook. You also need to attach an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume of at least 300 MB in size, which you can do in the domain settings for SageMaker Studio. In this example, we use an ml.g5.4xlarge instance, powered by a NVIDIA A10G GPU.\nWe start by opening the example notebook provided on our JupyterLab instance, import the corresponding packages, and set up the SageMaker session, role, and account information:\n\nimport boto3, json, sagemaker, time\nfrom sagemaker import get_execution_role\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nsess = boto3.Session()\nsm = sess.client(\"sagemaker\")\nclient = boto3.client(\"sagemaker-runtime\")\nregion = sess.region_name\nsts_client = sess.client('sts')\naccount_id = sts_client.get_caller_identity()['Account']\n\nPull the NIM container from the public container to push it to your private container\nThe NIM container that comes with SageMaker integration built in is available in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. To deploy it on your own SageMaker account securely, you can pull the Docker container from the public Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) container maintained by NVIDIA and re-upload it to your own private container:\n\n%%bash --out nim_image\npublic_nim_image=\"public.ecr.aws/nvidia/nim:llama3-8b-instruct-1.0.0\"\nnim_model=\"nim-llama3-8b-instruct\"\ndocker pull ${public_nim_image} \naccount=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)\nregion=${region:-us-east-1}\nnim_image=\"${account}.dkr.ecr.${region}.amazonaws.com/${nim_model}\"\n# If the repository doesn't exist in ECR, create it.\naws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names \"${nim_image}\" --region \"${region}\" > /dev/null 2>&1\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]\nthen\n    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name \"${nim_image}\" --region \"${region}\" > /dev/null\nfi\n# Get the login command from ECR and execute it directly\naws ecr get-login-password --region \"${region}\" | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \"${account}\".dkr.ecr.\"${region}\".amazonaws.com\ndocker tag ${public_nim_image} ${nim_image}\ndocker push ${nim_image}\necho -n ${nim_image}\ngi\n\nSet up the NVIDIA API key\nNIMs can be accessed using the NVIDIA API catalog. You just need to register for an NVIDIA API key from the NGC catalog by choosing Generate Personal Key.\nWhen creating an NGC API key, choose at least NGC Catalog on the Services Included dropdown menu. You can include more services if you plan to reuse this key for other purposes.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, we store it in an environment variable:\nNGC_API_KEY = YOUR_KEY\nThis key is used to download pre-optimized model weights when running the NIM.\nCreate your SageMaker endpoint\nWe now have all the resources prepared to deploy to a SageMaker endpoint. Using your notebook after setting up your Boto3 environment, you first need to make sure you reference the container you pushed to Amazon ECR in an earlier step:\n\nsm_model_name = \"nim-llama3-8b-instruct\"\ncontainer = {\n    \"Image\": nim_image,\n    \"Environment\": {\"NGC_API_KEY\": NGC_API_KEY}\n}\ncreate_model_response = sm.create_model(\n    ModelName=sm_model_name, ExecutionRoleArn=role, PrimaryContainer=container\n)\n\nprint(\"Model Arn: \" + create_model_response[\"ModelArn\"])\n\nAfter the model definition is set up correctly, the next step is to define the endpoint configuration for deployment. In this example, we deploy the NIM on one ml.g5.4xlarge instance:\n\nendpoint_config_name = sm_model_name\n\ncreate_endpoint_config_response = sm.create_endpoint_config(\n    EndpointConfigName=endpoint_config_name,\n    ProductionVariants=[\n        {\n            \"InstanceType\": \"ml.g5.4xlarge\",\n            \"InitialVariantWeight\": 1,\n            \"InitialInstanceCount\": 1,\n            \"ModelName\": sm_model_name,\n            \"VariantName\": \"AllTraffic\",\n            \"ContainerStartupHealthCheckTimeoutInSeconds\": 850\n        }\n    ],\n)\n\nprint(\"Endpoint Config Arn: \" + create_endpoint_config_response[\"EndpointConfigArn\"])\n\nLastly, create the SageMaker endpoint:\n\nendpoint_name = sm_model_name\n\ncreate_endpoint_response = sm.create_endpoint(\n    EndpointName=endpoint_name, EndpointConfigName=endpoint_config_name\n)\n\nprint(\"Endpoint Arn: \" + create_endpoint_response[\"EndpointArn\"])\n\nRun inference against the SageMaker endpoint with NIM\nAfter the endpoint is deployed successfully, you can run requests against the NIM-powered SageMaker endpoint using the REST API to try out different questions and prompts to interact with the generative AI models:\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello! How are you?\"},\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hi! I am quite well, how can I help you today?\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Write a short limerick about the wonders of GPU Computing.\"}\n]\npayload = {\n  \"model\": \"meta/llama3-8b-instruct\",\n  \"messages\": messages,\n  \"max_tokens\": 100\n}\n\n\nresponse = client.invoke_endpoint(\n    EndpointName=endpoint_name, ContentType=\"application/json\", Body=json.dumps(payload)\n)\n\noutput = json.loads(response[\"Body\"].read().decode(\"utf8\"))\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=2))\n\nThat\u2019s it! You now have an endpoint in service using NIM on SageMaker.\nNIM licensing\nNIM is part of the NVIDIA Enterprise License.\u00a0NIM comes with a 90-day evaluation license to start with. To use NIMs on SageMaker beyond the 90-day license,\u00a0connect with NVIDIA for AWS Marketplace private pricing. NIM is also available as a paid offering as part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software subscription\u00a0available on AWS Marketplace\nConclusion\nIn this post, we showed you how to get started with NIM on SageMaker for pre-built models. Feel free to try it out following the example notebook.\nWe encourage you to explore NIM to adopt it to benefit your own use cases and applications.\n\nAbout the Authors\nSaurabh Trikande is a Senior Product Manager for Amazon SageMaker Inference.

Affan Mir   August 28, 2024 9 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.13%          We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other ethical companies to invest in. Ethical investing involves choosing investments based on ethical principles, such as environmental, religious, or social values. Unlike socially conscious investing, which follows a specific set of guidelines, ethical investing is more individualized. Investors typically avoid being involved in gambling, alcohol, or firearms, and carefully research to make sure their investments align with their values.  Other stocks that are avoided by ethical investors include the shares of companies where employees are mistreated, have high gender parity, or discriminate against employees due to their race, religion, or sexual orientation. Environmentally conscious companies are also a huge part of ethical investing. Is Ethical Investing the Future? A 2022 report by Stamford University noted that the younger generation considers ethical investing quite crucial. A 2022 survey of 2,470 individual investors, conducted by Stanford University's Rock Center for Corporate Governance, found significant differences in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) preferences based on age and wealth. Younger and wealthier investors are more likely to support ESG initiatives, even at the expense of returns, while older and less wealthy investors are generally opposed.  Over recent years, support for ESG proposals has surged, with average support among S&P 500 companies increasing from 18% in 2012 to 35% in 2021, and the number of proposals passed rising from 0 to 28. The survey found that 70% of young investors (18-41 years old) are very concerned about environmental issues, compared to only 35% of older investors (58+ years old). Similarly, 65% of young investors are very concerned about social issues, versus 30% of older investors. When it comes to governance, 64% of younger investors express significant concern, while only 28% of older investors do. Moreover, 86% of older investors would not give up any or only a trivial amount of returns for carbon emission reductions, while 64% of younger investors would give up moderate or large amounts. Additionally, 91% of older investors are unwilling to sacrifice returns for workplace diversity improvements, compared to 62% of younger investors who are willing to do so. The survey also found that investor attitudes towards ESG differ across fund companies. Investors in State Street and Invesco funds exhibit nearly twice the concern for environmental issues compared to those in Fidelity funds. A significant percentage of investors in Fidelity (40-45%) and Vanguard funds are unwilling to forfeit returns for ESG, while a smaller percentage in American Funds and BlackRock (25-30%) share this reluctance.   Story Continues Despite these differences, 83% of investors across all demographics believe that fund managers should consider their views when voting on ESG issues. The results suggest that fund managers might need to allocate votes on a proportional basis to reflect the diverse preferences of their investor base.Our MethodologyFor this article, we scoured through several threads to discover which companies were considered ethical according to the users.

According to digital news brand, Stockhead, the company\u2019s advancements in GPUs are evidence of this effort. Its GPUs are highly regarded for their efficiency compared to traditional central processing units (CPUs), particularly in handling AI workloads.According to CEO Jensen Huang, the GPUs are up to 20 times more energy-efficient for specific AI and high-performance computing tasks than CPUs. This efficiency is critical for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers, which are becoming increasingly important as the demand for AI technology grows.In addition to their efficiency, the company\u2019s RAPIDS Accelerator is an important innovation that further enhances environmental sustainability. By optimizing the processing capabilities of its GPUs, the RAPIDS Accelerator can potentially cut a data center\u2019s carbon footprint by up to 80%.Major companies such as Adobe and AT&T have tested this technology and reported faster processing speeds, reduced costs, and improvements in AI model training. Furthermore, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in Berkeley demonstrated a five-fold increase in energy efficiency by utilizing Nvidia\u2019s A100 Tensor Core GPUs.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also made significant advancements in AI ethics as evidenced by initiatives led by Nikki Pope, the company\u2019s first-ever head of AI and legal ethics. Her team has introduced a beta-testing process involving community resource groups from diverse backgrounds to help identify and address unintended biases in AI products. This approach ensures that the company\u2019s AI models are not only more efficient but also more equitable and transparent.The \u201cModel Card++\u201d project, which enhances the transparency of AI models by providing detailed information on privacy, safety, and bias, has been well-received and represents its commitment to ethical AI development. The company\u2019s ability to deliver powerful, efficient solutions and its proactive approach to addressing AI ethics make it a compelling player in the tech industry.Furthermore, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also seems to have a healthy work culture as the company promotes a collaborative and non-hierarchical work environment, where teams are formed based on project needs and innovation is encouraged, even at the risk of failure. It is dedicated to providing excellent pay, benefits, and a supportive work culture, allowing employees to do meaningful work.The company offers several benefits to support employees and their families through various life events. These include resources for building a family, such as adoption, fertility, and surrogacy support, as well as assistance for developmental disabilities through RethinkCare. The company also provides college preparation resources through Collegewise, and offers support for life changes like marriage, divorce, having a child, moving, buying a home, and becoming eligible for Medicare.

While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Rivals have accused Wall Street darling Nvidia of abusing its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence \u2014 and the U.S. Justice Department is now investigating these complaints, technology news site The Information reported.According to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, Justice Department officials are looking into concerns Nvidia is potentially cornering the market and pressuring its customers to unfairly retain business. That includes allegations of Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant and its competitors.The Information also reported that U.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors about the complaints.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment or provide further information when reached by The Associated Press on Friday. But a statement from Nvidia said the company \u201cwins on merit\u201d \u2014 and competes \u201cbased on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIRS agents who investigated Hunter Biden given promotions at the Treasury Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovie theater trade group unveils new name, Cinema United, and renewed mission to promote moviegoing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the story of the return of stuck NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout directly acknowledging details of The Information\u2019s Thursday report, the company added that it is \u201chappy to provide any information regulators need.\u201dNvidia has faced calls for an antitrust investigation from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups before. Earlier this week, 10 progressive advocacy groups \u2014 including Demand Progress Education Fund and Tech Oversight Project \u2014 penned a letter to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in support of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNvidia is the world\u2019s chip gatekeeper,\u201d the groups wrote, arguing the company had \u201cbullied its way into a prominent investment position\u201d by leveraging scarce supply alongside tactics like blocking customers from doing business with competitors. \u201cSuch a company deserves the most aggressive scrutiny that the Department of Justice can bring to bear.\u201d\n\nNvidia\u2019s has cemented itself as a poster child for the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 and in the process become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In June, the tech giant briefly reached a market value of more than $3.3 trillion.Some of that market momentum has stalled a little since \u2014 and any stock climbing to such heights is vulnerable to some investors selling shares to lock in profits. On Friday afternoon, shares for Nvidia were down 3%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Company prepares earnings.  Nvidia stock is up 3,000% in 5 years.  Illustration by TradingViewAnother bumper quarter is expected when Nvidia releases its earnings results Wednesday after the bell. Here\u2019s what to know. Nvidia stock NVDA tumbled 2.2% to start this week\u2019s trading as the chip giant neared another milestone. On Wednesday, the stock market\u2019s main character and the leading AI player will release its earnings update for the most recent quarter. As is tradition, Wall Street has some lofty expectations to be met. But, perhaps even more important, the financials will shed light on how fast AI is getting adopted out there.  Nvidia is expected to more than double its sales year-on-year with analysts eyeballing $28.7 billion in revenue. Even that high bar will pale in comparison with the previous quarter\u2019s revenue growth of 262%. All underpinned by insatiable demand for the AI chips carrying a price tag north of $25,000 a piece. Besides the figures, investors will be watching for the release of the Blackwell GPU \u2014 a next-generation game-changing chip that was delayed over design flaws.  Shares of Nvidia have added more than 160% to their valuation this year. Briefly even \u2014 in June \u2014 the Jensen Huang-led tech juggernaut blasted off to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. And to think that just five years ago, before the monster 3,000% share price gain to date, Nvidia was barely known outside the techy and geeky circles.

Here\u2019s what to expect\n\nThe management's revenue guidance for the second quarter is $26 billion, while analysts estimate $28.59 billion\n\n\nAugust 20, 2024August 21, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), a pioneer in the development of graphic processing units, is currently ruling the artificial intelligence chip market, thanks to its aggressive AI strategy. When the company reports second-quarter results next week, the market will keep a close eye on the event looking for cues on the latest trends in the AI chip market.\nThe stock set a new record in mid-June this year after the price more than doubled in the first half, and Nvidia emerged as the most valuable company in the world. However, the shares withdrew from the peak in the following weeks, before returning to the growth path last month. NVDA is once again hovering near its all-time high, ahead of the earnings. The market\u2019s bullish outlook indicates the stock has more room for growth, which makes it a promising investment option for the long term. \u00a0\nStrong Estimates\nRecently, Nvidia executives forecasted revenues of $28 billion for the second quarter, the report for which is expected on Wednesday, August 28, at 4:20 pm ET. That is slightly below analysts\u2019 revenue forecast of $28.59 billion but well above the $13.5 billion revenue the company generated in the prior-year quarter. Experts\u2019 consensus earnings estimate, excluding special items, is $0.64 per share for Q2, compared to $0.25 per share in the same period of FY24.\nRight now, Nvidia is leading the revolutionary transformation of traditional data centers into centers of accelerated computing, by harnessing artificial intelligence. Tech hyperscalers, including internet companies and developers of AI models, are currently investing heavily in modern data centers powered by Nvidia\u2019s AI solutions.\nDominance\nThe company\u2019s state-of-the-art AI chips, combined with a first-mover advantage, give it a clear edge over rivals when it comes to tapping into emerging opportunities. According to the Nvidia leadership, the eagerly-awaited Blackwell platform, which is expected to revolutionize scientific computing with significantly higher speeds and energy efficiency, is in full production.\n\nAlso Read: After blowout quarter, Nvidia looks set to continue riding the AI wave\n\nFrom Nvidia\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\u201cCompanies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power.\u201d\nFinancials\nIn the first three months of fiscal 2025, revenue more than doubled to about $26 billion, continuing the trend seen in each of the trailing three quarters. The impressive top-line performance reflects strong revenue growth at the Data Center division and a double-digit increase in Gaming revenue. As a result, adjusted earnings climbed to $6.12 per share in the April quarter. Unadjusted profit grew more than 100% to $14.88 billion or $5.98 per share, compared to the first quarter of 2024. In the past six quarters, earnings consistently beat the Street view.\nAfter starting the week on a high note, Nvidia\u2019s shares experienced weakness on Tuesday and traded lower in the early hours. At $130, the last closing price is well above the twelve-month average of $76.56.\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\nListen to the conference calls as they happen.\u00a0Don't miss a beat!

The chipmaker had record quarterly revenue of $30 billion, up 122% year over year, during the three-month period ending July 28.\nAs Nvidia expands its broader AI infrastructure business with the Blackwell rack system solution, its data center segment revenues grew 154% year over year to $26.3 billion, accounting for the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s total quarterly revenue.\n\u201cData centers worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI,\u201d Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang said during the Wednesday earnings call. \u201cPeople are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nNvidia remains entrenched in a year-plus run as the leading provider of high-end AI processing power driving what Huang has dubbed \u201cthe next industrial revolution.\u201d\u00a0\nHyperscale cloud providers and generative AI model developers bought up Nvidia Hopper and Grace Hopper GPUs\u00a0as they rolled off the production line.\n\nNvidia revenues soared to $30B in two years driven by an AI boom\nRevenue by quarter, in billions\n\nWhile signs of a general chip shortage\u00a0have largely dissipated, orders for the Blackwell product line are piling up, according to Nvidia EVP and CFO Colette Kress.\n\u201cHopper supply and availability have improved,\u201d Kress said Wednesday. \u201cDemand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.\u201d\nThe company recently \u201cexecuted a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields\u201d and expects to start shipments in Q4, Kress added.\nForrester Senior Analyst Alvin Nguyen noted a modest improvement in the GPU stock.\n\u201cHopper supply and availability improvements means increased semiconductor capacity, but probably not substantially so,\u201d Nguyen said in an email. \u201cWith competitors like AMD and Intel catching up to Hopper levels of performance, Blackwell will be in higher demand by those wanting a competitive edge.\u201d\nAWS, Microsoft and Google, the three largest hyperscalers by market share, are racing to build out data center capacity. As enterprises and model builders devour existing GPU resources, cloud providers are pouring tens of billions of dollars into data center construction.\n\u201cIf you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey're renting capacity to model makers. They're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products.\u201d\nWhile GPU capacity can be hard to source during LLM training, it\u2019s typically available at other times, according to Nguyen. But the situation has put enterprise AI plans in a precarious spot.\n\u201cSince we know most enterprises are not getting GPU allocations, the lack of cloud availability means that costs will be higher and will cause them to scale back their AI ambitions,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cIf organizations cannot get AI services to experiment with and deploy AI capabilities, they will need to invest in something else.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nAI & Future Tech, \nHardware & Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

The stock drawdown was further exacerbated by some high profile investment funds exiting or cutting stake in Nvidia, and doomsday predictions Nvidia\u2019s shares were running rampant on Wall Street. However, the stock staged a strong recovery of more than 30% from these low levels, closing August 19 at $130. Even as the AI bellwether braces to release its second-quarter earnings report on August 28, what should investors expect from Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings print? Is it time to sell Nvidia after its nearly 3,000% rally in the past five years?\n\n\nNvidia Stock: Is It Time To Sell?\nWhen is a good time to sell Nvidia or any other stock? When the stock fundamentals have deteriorated and do not support the current price levels at which the stock trades. Is that true of Nvidia?\n\nAfter a meteoric rise in the past years, Nvidia stock lost its sheen somewhat after its recent slump of more than 20%. The selloff was triggered by concerns related to a possible capex slowdown by Nvidia\u2019s top customers and hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG).\n\nNvidia\u2019s Top Customers Deflate Capex Slowdown Worries; Estimated To Spend $200 Billion Collectively This Year\nHowever, all these companies have pledged to boost their spending on AI-related infrastructure even higher. Google parent Alphabet said its future capex will be \u201cat or above the first-quarter level of $12 billion.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft, which is Nvidia\u2019s largest customer, reported capital spending of $55.7 billion for the fiscal year (ended in June) up 75% from last year, and noted that capital spending in fiscal 2025 will top that level to meet the growing demand signal for its AI and cloud products.\nMeta stated that it currently expects significant capex growth in 2025 as it invests to support its AI research and product development efforts. The elevated AI capital spending appears to be paying off for Meta, which raised its third-quarter revenue guidance to $38.5 billion to $41 billion vs. the $39 billion consensus estimate, thanks to a robust growth in advertising. Meta has been leveraging AI to optimize ad targeting, which has significantly improved its advertising performance and business efficiencies. Amazon expects capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year and the majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure as the company continues to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. JPMorgan sees the four hyperscalers\u2013Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon\u2013spending a collective $200 billion in capex this year with AI buildout dominating the capital spending, which in turn bodes well for Nvidia.\n\nBlackwell\u2019s Strong Revenue Potential Should Likely Offset Any Possible Ramp Delays\nAnother cause for concern centers around the rumored delay in the rollout of Nvidia\u2019s next generation Blackwell AI chips, which are roughly two times faster than Nvidia\u2019s current Hopper models, but with notable improvements in energy efficiency. The delay is reportedly attributed to the complexity of the chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology used by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that manufactures these chips for Nvidia. The Blackwell launch is scheduled for later this year.\nHowever, Nvidia commented that Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half. Nvidia's hardware partners, like Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron, Pegatron, and Asus, have already demonstrated their Blackwell-based servers at Computex, a computer expo held annually in Taipei, Taiwan. Investors are hoping that Nvidia may provide a more specific timeline for the Blackwell ramp in its upcoming earnings call, beyond an ambiguous reference to the second half of the year.\nEven assuming there is a delay in a worst case scenario, it is good to know that Nvidia is working on fixing the design complexities rather than bringing out a flawed model that is bound to fail. The delay (if there is one) is unlikely to hamper Nvidia or its prospects in the longer run. Don\u2019t forget, Nvidia is still the undisputed leader in the data center GPU market, and even if AMD brings out a rival product comparable to Blackwell, it will still have to catch up with the yawning chasm in market share.\nBesides, there\u2019s the alluring revenue dynamics at play. According to news reports that reference a Morgan Stanley analysis, Nvidia and its partners are expected to price an AI server cabinet, featuring the upcoming Blackwell GPUs, between $2 million and $3 million. This pricing could potentially lead to an estimated annual revenue exceeding $200 billion in 2025 based on the requirement for tens of thousands of AI servers. If reports were to be trusted, Nvidia may have boosted its Blackwell orders with TSMC by 25% and that could be favorable for TSMC, which is manufacturing the most powerful AI chip in the world based on Blackwell architecture.\nSmart Money\u2019s Mixed Sentiment Weakens Nvidia Sell Argument\nThe much-touted exodus of top money managers from Nvidia shares during the second quarter is reflected in some 13F filings. The SEC's Form 13F must be filed every quarter by institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM).\nAccording to the latest 13F filings,\n\n\nStanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office slashed its stake in Nvidia by 88% and now holds less than 1% of Nvidia in its portfolio.\nDavid Tepper's Appaloosa Management reduced its Nvidia holdings by 84.4% and now Nvidia is just 1.38% of its portfolio.\nSoros Capital Management LLC, Twin Tree Management LP and Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management Holdings exited their positions in Nvidia.\nLight Street Capital Management Holdings cut its Nvidia stake by 26.1% but Nvidia is still its top holding representing 17.1% of its portfolio.\nLee Ainslie's hedge fund Maverick Capital trimmed its stake in Nvidia by 2.86% but Nvidia is still among its top five holdings representing 4.8% of its portfolio.\nWhale Rock Capital Management Holdings cut its stake by 40.7% in Nvidia, which still remains its top holding representing 8.5% of its portfolio.\nInterestingly, the top shareholders of Nvidia shares\u2013Vanguard and BlackRock\u2013added 11.4 million and 16.9 million shares, respectively during the second quarter.\n\n\nWhile it may seem like a great strategy to follow \u201csmart money,\u201d it should be noted that the 13F is just one among several data points for investors to make informed investment decisions. Besides, the 13-F can be filed up to 45 days after the end of a quarter, meaning that the filing only gives a peek into past strategies of institutional investment managers and may not hold much relevance at the time when it comes into public knowledge. Also, institutional investment managers have deep pockets, and specific investment strategies which they are not required to reveal to the public fully, like their short positions for example. So attempting to reverse-engineer their success without understanding the underlying strategy can often burn the investor.\nAt this point, does it look like there is any compelling reason to sell Nvidia shares?\nNvidia\u2019s Market Position\nAs a key enabler of AI with its GPUs powering even supercomputers used by Meta and Tesla, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market with an estimated market share ranging from 70% to 95%. For a hardware company, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins are quite high at 73.8% for fiscal 2024. Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat lies in CUDA, its proprietary software stack that allows developers to leverage the parallel processing capabilities of Nvidia GPUs to accelerate machine learning workloads. Attempts to migrate from the CUDA have gone south, but Nvidia is never negligent. It constantly evolves CUDA\u2019s capabilities, to retain its market leadership. But that hasn\u2019t deterred AMD, Intel and Google from persevering in valiant attempts to unseat the CUDA from its pedestal.\nNvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell platform has an inference capability that is 30x of the incumbent Hopper\u2019s, while consuming 25x less cost and energy. Nvidia has dismissed any concerns of customers holding off on Hopper orders because of the upcoming Blackwell launch. The demand for both Hopper and Blackwell platforms is well ahead of supply and this is expected to continue well into the next year. The upcoming earnings report will provide more clues on the Blackwell ramp.\nNvidia sees a long-term market opportunity of $1 trillion with $300 billion from datacenter, $100 billion from gaming, $300 billion from autonomous vehicles and robotics, $150 billion from industrial meta verse via its Omniverse ecosystem and $150 billion from Enterprise via Nvidia AI Enterprise\u2013its operating system for enterprise AI, as well as DGX Cloud that gives customers instant access to Nvidia AI supercomputing in global-scale clouds.\nHistorical Earnings Performance\nNvidia\u2019s growth has been strong and profitable. In the last five years, revenue has grown from $10.9 billion in fiscal 2020 to $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024 with revenue reaching $26 billion for the first quarter of 2025, while operating margins have risen from 34% to 61%, and at 69% for the first quarter.\nData Center revenues constitute a major chunk of its top line, and have grown at a 75% CAGR in the past five years to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024. In the first quarter, data center revenues were $22.6 billion.\nGaming revenue, which represented 17% of Nvidia\u2019s fiscal 2024 top line, has grown at a five-year CAGR of 11% from $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020 to $10.4 billion in fiscal 2024.\nNvidia\u2019s Professional Visualization segment represented 3% of 2024 revenues, but is seen as a significant future growth driver. The business offers Omniverse as a development platform for enhancing productivity and introducing new capabilities in design, manufacturing and digital content creation.\nNvidia\u2019s automotive revenues stem from its platform solutions for automated driving and in-vehicle cockpit computing. The Nvidia DRIVE\niShares S&P 500 Value ETF\n is an end-to-end Autonomous Vehicle (AV) platform with a full software stack powered by systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) in the vehicle. Xiaomi\u2019s first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan is built on the Nvidia Drive Orin, which is Nvidia\u2019s AI car computer for software-defined autonomous vehicle fleets. Nvidia Drive Thor, the successor to Orin, has already procured design wins with EV makers, and slated for production in vehicles in 2025. Although automotive revenues represented only 2% of the top line in fiscal 2024, this is another key area of growth for Nvidia in the future, amid the rising momentum of self-driving vehicles. The global autonomous vehicle market is estimated to grow to $448.6 billion by 2035, according to Allied Market Research.\nFinancial Health Indicators (H2)Nvidia\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) has grown from $4.3 billion in fiscal 2020 to an impressive $26.9 billion in fiscal 2024, with first quarter FCF at a stellar $14.9 billion. In fiscal 2024, the company spent $395 million in dividends, which it plans to maintain, and $9.5 billion on stock buybacks, reflecting its strong alignment with shareholders. It is not surprising considering that Nvidia\u2019s Founder CEO Jensen Huang owns more than a 3% stake in Nvidia. There was some controversy about the CEO offloading some shares and making good profits before Nvidia shares dropped. Although the timing of the sale turned out to be unusual, the shares were sold under a 10b5-1 trading arrangement that allows company insiders to sell company stock on a predetermined schedule without breaching insider trading laws. So, there\u2019s no cause for concern. Like other shareholders, Jensen Huang experienced a significant paper loss when Nvidia\u2019s stock value fell in the recent period.\nSector And Macro Trends Influencing Nvidia \nAI is a secular growth trend, not a one-off pattern to fizzle out. According to management consulting firm MarketsandMarkets, AI is estimated to grow from a value of $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030, and Nvidia\u2019s strong positioning makes it a key beneficiary of these AI tailwinds. However, Nvidia\u2019s growth is expected to normalize from the fast, furious and feverish pace to stable and more sustainable levels.\nFed interest rate cut expectations:\nA low interest rate environment is typically better for tech companies, as it spurs R&D spending, deal making (M&A) and fundraising in the tech sector. However, AI has been the winning theme so far, defying the higher-for-longer interest environment, by shaping capital spending plans of large tech enterprises.\nMega Tech capex spending on the rise:\nCapex of mega cap techs are at new highs, and the budget is expected to expand further in 2025. Tech spending intent by corporations remained positive in the second quarter of 2024, as reflected by the U.S. Technology Demand Indicator (TDI) score of 51.71 in the second quarter (as measured by 451 Research). The score is slightly lower than the first-quarter number of 52.11, but still positive as a score above 50 typically indicates expansion. This bodes well for Nvidia, which is a key beneficiary of AI tech spending. With the wide expectation of Fed interest rate cuts starting in September, the capital spending environment in the tech sector is likely to get even more conducive.\nGaming and e-sports growth:\nThe global gaming market is estimated to generate $187.7 billion in revenue in 2024 with nearly half of it originating from mobile games, according to gaming market data and research firm Newzoo. Nvidia\u2019s flagship gaming GPU product line GeForce, supports more than 200 million gamers. The latest RTX 40-series graphics cards of GeForce based on Ada Lovelace architecture continue to stay on top of the game. The gaming industry is looking forward to Nvidia\u2019s next-generation GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards based on the Blackwell architecture. Significant growth in e-sports\u2013the gaming competitions for professional players and teams\u2013also highlights the demand for high speed and performance packed Nvidia GPUs.\nAccelerating adoption of Industrial Metaverse:\nIndustrial Metaverse is a virtual environment that will apply metaverse elements like digital twins, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR\nArweave\n) to industrial applications, to enhance the efficiencies of industrial operations and processes. A simple example would be the maintenance team in a manufacturing company applying VR to simulate repairs on a digital twin of a machine and optimizing the procedure before actually applying it to a physical machine. Allowing businesses to model prototypes and test in a digital environment before committing physical and human resources to a project, will enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve overall productivity, while unlocking immense value for enterprises. Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse is a scalable, multi-GPU real-time development platform for building and operating metaverse applications. Nvidia is collaborating with Siemens to build the industrial Metaverse and to increase use of AI-driven digital twin technology for enhancing industrial automation. MarketsandMarkets estimates the global industrial metaverse market to reach $228.6 billion by 2029 from an estimated $28.7 billion in 2024, with an estimated CAGR of 51.5%, thanks to the rising adoption of digital twins, advancements in AR, VR, AI, IoT, and rising demand for efficiency and optimization in the industrial sector. As a key player, Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from this growth.\nNvidia\u2019s Risks And Challenges\nPossible U.S. trade ban on Sales to China May Cost Nvidia $12 billion In Revenue\nA report citing Jeffries analysts noted that the U.S. may implement new trade restrictions that could ban Nvidia from selling its H20 AI chips to China. H20 is Nvidia\u2019s specially designed chip for China, after regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China, including Nvidia\u2019s H100, citing national security concerns. However, H20\u2019s computing power is significantly lesser compared to H100, to achieve compliance with the U.S. sanctions. But, now even the H20 may possibly be banned for sale in China when the U.S. reviews its semiconductor export controls in October, says the report and if the ban occurs, Nvidia stands to lose an estimated $12 billion in revenue. Analysts had previously projected that Nvidia will deliver more than 1 million new H20 chips to China, and generate more than $12 billion in sales as each H20 chip is priced between $12,000 and $13,000. In the prior financial year, Nvidia\u2019s China revenues were estimated at $10.3 billion.\nHuawei Reportedly challenging Nvidia\u2019s Chinese market share with new AI chip\nAccording to a WSJ report, Huawei is preparing to challenge Nvidia\u2019s H100 AI chips with its Ascend 910C, and expects to begin shipping these chips as early as October. The Ascend 910C chip is reportedly being tested by Chinese companies, while TikTok parent ByteDance, Baidu and China Mobile may be engaged in early discussions to buy the chip. If the news reports were to be believed, this could pose a serious threat to Nvidia\u2019s market share in China, which is already very limited because of U.S. trade restrictions.\nNvidia\u2019s Second-Quarter Earnings: What To Expect?\nNvidia is scheduled to release second-quarter 2025 earnings on August 28. Here\u2019s a rundown of what investors can expect\u2026\n\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to report second quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents a share on revenues of $28.5 billion, representing a more than two-fold increase from year-ago\u2019s split-adjusted 27 cents per share on $13.51 billion revenues.\nNvidia appears well positioned to beat earnings and revenue estimates for the second quarter, if we look to the last four quarters for direction. Nvidia beat EPS and revenue estimates in the last four quarters, with the magnitude of beats reducing sequentially. (See table below.)\nA definite time frame for the Blackwell ramp would be helpful, if Nvidia wants to put the delay rumors to rest. Nvidia had said it expects to see a lot of Blackwell revenues this year. Analysts project Blackwell revenues exceeding $200 billion for Nvidia next year.\nNvidia is well positioned to benefit from its top customers\u2019 plans to continue spending heavily on AI-related infrastructure.\nFundamentally, nothing has changed to impact Nvidia\u2019s competitive edge in AI or accelerated computing. Among peers, Nvidia is still an enviable market leader in AI chips. The demand for both Hopper and Blackwell platforms is well ahead of supply and is expected to continue well into the next year. Strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference should propel data center growth.\nNvidia may provide more color on its new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution that began shipping in the first quarter. The Spectrum-X enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. Nvidia expects the Spectrum-X to ramp to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\nAn update can be expected on Sovereign AI, which refers to a nation's capabilities to produce AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks to navigate the complex landscape of data privacy and security. Nvidia sees its Sovereign AI revenue approaching the high single-digit billions this year, from nothing last year.\nAn update may be expected on Omniverse industrial digitalization, which is expected to drive the next wave of growth in the professional visualization business.\nNvidia sees its automotive business driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. The second quarter earnings call may provide more clues on the demand for the Nvidia Drive Thor and the Nvidia Drive Orin.\nAny update on Nvidia\u2019s China sales/market will be a key watch point.\n\n\nPost Earnings Stock Performance\nIn the past five quarters, Nvidia shares have continued to set new highs in the days and weeks following a strong earnings report and guidance. However, after Nvidia reported spectacular results for the second quarter of 2023, the stock rose by a lackluster 6% although that was still a new high. Was it because the Nvidia stock had run up significantly ahead of its second quarter announcement? Will that pattern repeat this year?\nSource: Yahoo Finance\nBottom Line\nNvidia is firing on all cylinders. Fundamentally nothing has changed much for Nvidia. It is still the market leader for AI chips and demand for its GPUs appears as strong as ever with its top customers having pledged to keep spending heavily on AI infrastructure. Any delay in the Blackwell ramp may cause near-term volatilities, but the true risk lies in the likelihood of a trade ban that would stop it from selling its H20 AI chips to China, the second largest economy in the world. But if the company loses an estimated $12 billion in China revenues, there is still the $200 billion in estimated revenue potential for Blackwell. The true competitive edge of Nvidia lies in the strong moat it builds around its products, like the CUDA for instance.\nNvidia could report a stellar second quarter, but will the Nvidia stock rally in the near-term? That depends. If the stock runs up ahead of its second-quarter earnings, then the post-earnings rally may likely be lackadaisical. But, Nvidia stock is for the long haul, as AI is here to stay. The strategy would be to buy on dips.\nPlease note that I am not a registered investment advisor and readers should do their own due diligence before investing in this or any other stock.

Umar Farooq   August 22, 2024 7 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.13%          We recently published a list of 10 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other big data stocks. The global big data market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to reach $103 billion by 2027, more than doubling its size from 2018. This explosive growth is driven by the increasing reliance on data to inform business decisions, optimize operations, and unlock new revenue streams. According to Statista, the software segment, in particular, is poised to dominate, accounting for 45% of the market by 2027. Big data, characterized by its massive volume, high velocity, and wide variety, presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.  The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today\u2019s competitive landscape.  Investment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market\u2019s growth.   Story Continues According to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.In healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.With such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Best Big Data Stock To Buy Now?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Average Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 5.40%Average Analyst Share Price Target: $131.31\u00a0Number ten on our list of ten best big data stocks to buy now is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company makes chips that are used to facilitate big data use cases. The average analyst price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is $131.31, indicating a potential upside of 5.40% as of August 16. Analysts consider NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a strong buy ahead of its August 28 earnings report. Despite a 35% drop, the stock rebounded and may surge again. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a leader in the AI market, stands to benefit from the sector\u2019s rapid growth, projected to expand from $184 billion in 2024 to $826 billion by 2030. Analysts believe the company\u2019s current 78% gross margin may decline due to competition, but this isn\u2019t an immediate concern. With a forward P/E ratio of around 40 for fiscal 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued earnings growth could drive its stock higher, making it a solid long-term buy despite potential risks.Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 10th on our list of the best big data stock to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Our initial beta release in February was the first step in our journey to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience and RTX Experience.\nA new update, available now in-app and from our website, adds Display settings, RTX Video Enhancement controls, application sorting, app translations for users in other countries, and more.\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers, enabling quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nRead on to learn more about the new NVIDIA app features, and what\u2019s coming next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Control Center Adds Display & RTX Video Features\u00a0\nIn our new NVIDIA app beta update, the System tab now includes a new Displays section, featuring resolution, refresh rate and orientation controls for connected monitors and TVs. We plan to continue adding more features like G-SYNC controls, Surround options, custom resolutions, and multi-monitor support in the future, so stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a new Video section that adds RTX Video Enhancements and customization sliders for RTX Video HDR. RTX Video HDR instantly converts any Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video playing in internet browsers into vibrant High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos using the power of AI. RTX Video HDR allows all GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their display\u2019s HDR capabilities to display more vivid, dynamic colors in streamed video and local files played on Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and via the VLC media player RTX branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution (VSR) uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs by removing compression artifacts, and sharpening edges when upscaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the System > Video tab in the NVIDIA app, you can easily activate these options, and see in real-time if they\u2019re active when watching video or streams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking the icons next to each feature will open configuration panels. The latest NVIDIA app update adds new sliders for RTX HDR, enabling you to adjust peak brightness, middle grey brightness, contrast, and saturation in real-time as your video plays, making for easy adjustments. For Video Super Resolution, you can manually set the quality level, although we recommend using Auto as it dynamically adjusts quality based on GPU utilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the technology, go to the knowledge base article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates From User Feedback\u00a0\nYour feedback is important to us and we\u2019ve made improvements in a few areas.\u00a0\nOn the Graphics tab, the list of games and apps on your system can now be alphabetically sorted and filtered via the icon highlighted below. And by clicking the three vertically-aligned dots on the top right of the program info, you can hide entries on the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Settings, you can now select different languages for the NVIDIA app, enabling users in other countries to make full use of the app\u2019s options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA app beta now supports many languages, as demonstrated in the Spanish example above\nThe Statistics Overlay can now display FPS 1% Low stats, along with real-time statistics for a dozen other stats, including CPU usage, latency, and a full suite of GPU info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ChatRTX Available From NVIDIA App\nNVIDIA ChatRTX is a demo app that lets you personalize a GPT large language model (LLM) connected to your own content\u2014docs, notes, images, or other data. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), TensorRT-LLM, and RTX acceleration, you can query a custom chatbot to quickly get contextually relevant answers. And because it all runs locally on your Windows RTX PC, laptop or workstation, you\u2019ll get fast and secure results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn NVIDIA app\u2019s Home tab, you can now download and install ChatRTX, along with GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast, and other NVIDIA applications. With everything available in one location, it\u2019s easier and faster to enhance your experience and unlock new possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Reward: PC Game Pass\nNVIDIA app users get access to rewards, such as in-game content, exclusive GeForce NOW premium membership offers, and more.

The company has consistently exceeded expectations, but strategists warn of widespread effects on the stock market if investors are disappointed.\nNvidia's financial results have loomed large thanks to the role of the company's semiconductor chips in developing\u00a0artificial intelligence technology. The firm has consistently delivered blowout results and outperformed analyst estimates and lofty investor expectations, sending its stock soaring.\nThis time, Morningstar technology equity strategist\u00a0Brian Colello\u00a0is confident the chipmaker's momentum will continue.\n\"I\u2019d be stunned if they fell short of their guidance for the July quarter and/or didn't increase it for the October quarter,\" he says.\nBut in the unlikely event that investors are disappointed with the company's results, he warns that the ramifications would be far-reaching: \"it's fair to say that if Nvidia's stock were to fall for whatever reason, it'd take down all AI-related names with it.\"\nBecause mega-cap AI companies are weighted so heavily in the major indexes, a stumble by Nvidia could potentially ripple through the broader market.\nHere's everything investors need to know ahead of Nvidia's earnings.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia Stock\n\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $105.00 (\u00a380.03)\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating:\u00a0\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High\nNvidia Stock's Wild Ride\nShares of Nvidia are up 157% this year and 194% over the past 12 months. The stock fell at the beginning of August amid a market selloff sparked by concerns about economic growth and the strengthening of the Japanese yen, but it has nearly recovered all those losses. Shares are up more than 9% over the past week. The stock now trades at around $128 per share, and Colello considers it fairly valued.\n\nOverall, analysts remain bullish. Nvidia raked in $26 billion in revenue in the first fiscal quarter ending in April 2024. They expect the company to exceed its revenue guidance of roughly $28 billion in the July quarter, according to FactSet's consensus estimates.\n\"Like in the past several quarters, we think Nvidia will report results exceeding guidance while projecting even higher revenue in the October quarter,\" Colello\u00a0writes. He points to continued spending by cloud computing firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon (AMZN)\u00a0on AI infrastructure. He adds that Nvidia should be able to increase revenue even further as constraints from its suppliers ease over the next few quarters.\nMeanwhile, analysts at Goldman Sachs predict \"another strong double-digit revenue and earnings growth year for Nvidia,\" while Bank of America analysts characterize the stock's recent volatility as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for concern over the long run.\n\"This company has been beyond phenomenal,\" says Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\"I cannot think of a company that has so consistently beaten expectations, raised expectations, and then turned around the next quarter, beaten those expectations, and then raised them again. It's unprecedented.\" But at the same time, he adds, \"it's hard to imagine the streak continuing forever.\"\nCan Nvidia Stock Keep Soaring?\nFor Colello, the bigger question surrounding Nvidia stock is the durability of AI spending over the long term. For now, he writes, \"both Alphabet\u202f(GOOGL) and Meta have conceded that it is far riskier to underinvest in AI than overinvest.\" While that may bode well for the stock in the near term, \"it increases the risk that there will be a crash in investment at some point once they secure adequate AI GPU supply.\"\nSosnick agrees: \"the question that we have to wrestle with is whether the AI adoption cycle can continue at this pace.\" The market's\u00a0August selloff\u00a0was a sign that investors are already beginning to question the durability of the trade. Tech names stumbled while value stocks and small-caps surged.\n\"We've seen the AI trade roll off a bit in the past month versus the broader market, as I think the market has proper concerns about the longevity of spending,\" Colello says.\nRisks to Index Fund Investors\nStrategists say it's not just AI companies that could struggle if Nvidia disappoints. \"There are knock-on effects,\" Sosnick says.\nSo far this year, Nvidia alone has been responsible for 4.12 percentage points (roughly a quarter) of the\u00a0Morningstar US Market Index's\u00a017.2% return, according to data from Morningstar Direct.\nSosnick explains that an investor in an S&P 500 index fund might assume that they own a diverse basket of stocks, but eight of the most heavily weighted AI firms (Nvidia, Amazon, Apple [AAPL], Microsoft, Meta, Tesla [TSLA], Alphabet, and Broadcom [AVGO]) now account for roughly one-third of the weight of that fund. Despite some signs that the market's gains have broadened beyond big tech, \"the concentration risk is nowhere close to gone,\" he says.\nThat means that if the AI trade falters on less-than-stellar earnings from Nvidia, investors could feel the impact across their entire portfolio. \"Nvidia occupies such a privileged space in investors' mindsets,\" Sosnick says. If the company were to spark investor concerns that the AI trade was slowing, \"that could have very strong ramifications.\"\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings Season Drama to Your Inbox\nSign up Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nNVIDIA\nSEMICONDUCTORS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

After the chip designer reported triple-digit sales and earnings growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, investors are wondering how far NVDA stock can realistically grow in the next five years.\n\n\nLet's dive in to answer that question, starting with a teaser: Even the conservative view might make your jaw drop.\n\nNvidia's Current Market Position\nNvidia specializes in semiconductors, primarily microprocessors known as graphics processing units or GPUs. These are used in many applications, including Nvidia's own gaming PCs, autonomous vehicles and 5G RAN networks. But where Nvidia has become dominant recently is in AI-capable chips and related software.\n\nTechspot reports that Nvidia owns 88% of the GPU market as of the first quarter 2024. That compares to 80% market share in the prior quarter. The jump in positioning came at the expense of competitors Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC), which both lost share in the first quarter.\n\nCurrent Financial Health\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, Nvidia generated $26 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.12. Relative to the prior-year quarter, sales grew 262% and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 461%. The company also increased its gross margin by 12.1 points.\nOver the past 18 months, Nvidia has quadrupled its annual sales, added nearly 20 points to its gross margin and increased non-GAAP diluted EPS by more than five times. The stock price has gained nearly 500% as a result.\n\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, Nvidia is strong. The chip designer's cash balance doubled in 2023, and the company now has more cash than debt.\nWhere Will Nvidia Stock Be In 5 Years?\nIn five years, the AI chip market is expected to be worth $311 billion, according to MarketsandMarkets. This translates to a compound annual growth rate of 20.4% from 2024. Applying that growth rate to Nvidia's data center sales, assuming the current annual run rate of about $90 billion, equates to more than $225 billion in AI-related sales by 2029. That alone could justify another doubling of Nvidia's stock price by 2029, assuming the margins don't degrade terribly.\nWhile this line of thinking also assumes Nvidia won't lose market share in AI, which is unlikely, it also ignores the rest of Nvidia's business. Note, too, that other estimates predict a steeper trajectory for overall AI chip sales. As reported by CNBC, Nvidia's competitor AMD expects the AI chip market to reach $400 billion by 2027.\nFor those reasons, it doesn't feel farfetched to expect Nvidia's market cap to double in the next five years to $6 trillion. That estimate is actually conservative compared to other views. Beth Kindig of the I/O Fund, for example, expects Nvidia to reach $10 trillion in market cap by 2030.\nLet's review some of the factors in play for Nvidia going forward.\nGrowth Drivers\nThree growth drivers for Nvidia include its Blackwell platform launch, government demand for AI hardware and data center demand for hardware that supports multiple use cases, such as AI and 5G RAN.\n\nBlackwell: Blackwell GPU architecture incorporates multiple innovations to trim the energy consumption required for developing, training and running large language models (LLM). Nvidia says the platform will lower costs and energy consumption by up to 25 times. Although the chip launch has been pushed back due to a design flaw, Meta Plaforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) are rumored to have Blackwell orders in place valued at tens of billions.\nGovernment demand: Forbes Senior Contributor Peter Cohan believes governments will increasingly invest in high-performance GPUs to develop their own LLMs, in their language and with their data.\nData center demand: Nvidia's hardware allows data centers to maximize their utilization by supporting generative AI and 5G applications. Utilization and efficiency will continue to be prioritized in the data center as computing demand grows.\n\nInnovation And R&D\nNvidia opened its doors in 1993 with a mission to revolutionize PC and video game graphics. Since then, the company has launched several industry firsts, including the GPU, the mobile GPU, the programmable GPU and the mobile workstation GPU.\nIn the early 2010s, CEO Jensen Huang identified AI as the company's next big opportunity\u2014roughly a decade before the masses had heard of ChatGPT. Thanks to Huang's forethought and vision, Nvidia has established a dominant first-mover position in a technology that could revolutionize the way business is done.\nWith its forward-thinking culture and innovation mindset, Nvidia will likely continue to identify opportunities, reinvent and create new markets\u2014at least as long as Huang is running the show.\nMarket Opportunities\nMajor market opportunities for Nvidia going forward include AI, gaming and digital-twin technology.\n\nAI: Nvidia's dominance in AI infrastructure is well-documented. While the company may lose some market share as competition heats up, it is well-positioned to capture the bulk of AI value creation over the next five years.\nGaming: Nvidia's AI business now dwarfs its gaming segment in terms of revenue. However, Huang has a vision for synergies between AI and gaming. AI-driven improvements in graphics and game dynamics could inspire a resurgence in the video game market. Nvidia would likely be the driver and main beneficiary of that resurgence.\nDigital-twin technology: A digital twin is a virtual replication of a physical object or system, such as a manufacturing line. The twin uses real-time data to simulate the replicated system so it can identify issues and potential optimizations. Beyond efficiency gains, this technology has broader implications for robotics innovation and other generative physical AI applications. Nvidia Omniverse, Nvidia AI and OpenUSD support digital-twin development.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nNvidia is the AI chip leader now, but competition will surely increase over the next five years. The closest competitors today are chipmakers AMD and Intel. Cloud providers are also a threat as they work to develop their own AI solutions. Some of these providers, including Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN), are Nvidia customers today.\nRegulatory And Geopolitical Factors\nU.S. sanctions on high-performance chips sales to China have already affected Nvidia. These sanctions were first introduced in 2022 and then updated in 2023. Nvidia has developed lower-performance chips that are compliant, but Chinese demand for these so far has been weak.\nChinese sales contributed 17% to Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue. Chinese research firm CCID Consulting predicts that China will account for 30% of the global AI market by 2035, according to Reuters.\nRisks And Challenges\nThree risks to monitor for Nvidia are market volatility, rising competition and the inherent uncertainty of innovation.\n\nMarket volatility: Technology is a volatile sector. Stock prices can fluctuate for any number of reasons, some of which may have little to do with Nvidia's business fundamentals. Compounding the volatility risk is AI's potential to create negative headlines around known problems such as hallucinations.\nCompetition: Any $100 billion market opportunity is going to inspire aggressive competitive behavior. Nvidia is so far ahead of its peers in R&D that the company has been insulated from extreme competition so far. But that won't be the case forever. To remain dominant in AI chips, Nvidia will have to innovate faster and cheaper than everyone else.\nInnovation uncertainty: Creating new products requires foresight and savvy resource allocation. There is always the chance money will be spent on products that disappoint. Nvidia has a good track record for identifying massive opportunities early and rising to lead the market, but then the launch of the company's Blackwell platform has been delayed due to a design flaw. Time will tell if Nvidia's rush to stay ahead of the competition will lead to more errors.\n\nNvidia's Long-Term Investment Potential\nRight now, it's hard to imagine Nvidia doing anything but creating more value. The company has a lot going for it: dominance in one of investing's most popular industries, an enviable customer list, tons of cash, a knack for spotting opportunity and a proven process for innovating. These factors position the chip designer well for long-term growth.\nIt almost sounds too good to be true, which is a good reason to step lightly into a Nvidia position. Yes, the company stands to double or triple in value, again, in the next several years\u2014but it won't be a smooth ride. Given that Nvidia's multiples are well above their five-year averages, you could use the volatility to your advantage. Waiting for a pullback will amplify your growth potential and take some of the stress out of the position.\nBottom Line\nNvidia is a good company with loads of opportunity ahead. Unquestionably, there is long-term growth potential for investors who buy at the right price and can handle a wild ride.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)What are the main drivers of Nvidia's growth?\u00a0Nvidia may also see rising demand for its products from multitenant data centers and government agencies.\u00a0\u00a0How does Nvidia compare to its competitors?\u00a0Analysts say Nvidia's hardware and software are years ahead of the competition.\u00a0What are the risks associated with investing in Nvidia?\u00a0Risks of investing in Nvidia include market volatility, rising competition and the inherent uncertainty of innovation.\u00a0How will global expansion impact Nvidia's stock?Global expansion of AI infrastructure will drive demand for Nvidia's products.

[+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Jaque Silva/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nCould Nvidia stock reach $300 in the next few years? Does this sound ridiculous? Consider this, less than nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2.5x and trades at close to $128 presently. Nvidia stock trades at about 75x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not at all. Especially if you consider the fact that the company\u2019s earnings could be about 4x the current level in the next few years.\n\n\nHow is that?\n\nIf Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next 3 years - its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY\u201924 to around $250 billion by FY\u201927 or over 4x. For context, Nvidia\u2019s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years. These growth rates could hold up, given the surge of demand for Nvidia\u2019s high-end graphics chips, which have emerged as the defacto silicon for running artificial intelligence applications. The lure of AI is growing each day, and the demand for chips isn\u2019t fading yet.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhile initial AI models unveiled by the likes of OpenAI were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, sectors as diverse as energy to real estate, healthcare and medical equipment, and industrial robots are looking to leverage AI tech as an input that can help these companies win. \n\nNVidia has already done it in the past\nTo put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled 900% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA\u2019s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular - as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nBut there is more to the story this time around\nLet\u2019s take the case of Eli Lilly - the maker of the weight loss drug Zepbound. Like all companies, Lilly uses electricity as an input in its factories and offices. Clearly, Lilly doesn\u2019t expect to win against a rival such as Pfizer because it uses more electricity. Now AI is fast becoming a core input for companies across sectors, just like electricity. But with an important difference. Lilly believes that leveraging AI in its R&D will help develop better products, faster than the competition. Unlike more electricity, more AI will help Lilly win in the marketplace. This changes everything. It implies Lilly will want to invest in AI. Aggressively. With little concern about price, it will be willing to pay for better, faster chips from companies like Nvidia. Nvidia is in a rare position of producing something where the demand seems limitless. Limitless, across sectors and industries. And this isn\u2019t going away soon.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nCombine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia\u2019s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY\u201919 to about 49% in FY\u201924 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia\u2019s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures.\n\nSo is 4x growth in earnings possible? \nSure. Looks quite reasonable when you combine 4x revenue growth with potentially flat margins over the next few years. Now if earnings grow 4x, the PE multiple will shrink by 4 times, assuming the stock price stays the same! But that\u2019s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting will not happen. If earnings expand 4-fold over the next few years, instead of PE shrinking from a figure around 75x now to about 19x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 40x to 45x looks quite likely. This would make a 2.5x growth in Nvidia stock price to levels of about $300 a real possibility.\n\n\nWhat about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won\u2019t make much difference whether it takes 3 years or 5, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.\nAnd it could be a bumpy ride yet again. While there is definitely a case to be made for large long-term gains from NVDA stock, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Trefis\nInvest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\nEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? When Is Debt Dangerous? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.  Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What Is NVIDIA's Net Debt? You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in April 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, it does have US$31.4b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$21.7b.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Debt to Equity History August 26th 2024   A Look At NVIDIA's Liabilities We can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$15.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$31.4b and US$12.4b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$15.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.  This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$3.18t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that NVIDIA has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely. Even more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 956% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.   Story Continues Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 82% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$21.7b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$39b, being 82% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

Built on NVIDIA Omniverse, RTX Remix consists of a runtime renderer and a toolkit app that facilitates the modding of game assets and materials.\nLast year, NVIDIA open sourced the RTX Remix Runtime, allowing modders to expand game compatibility and advance rendering capabilities. Now, NVIDIA is open sourcing the RTX Remix Toolkit, allowing modders to streamline how assets are replaced and scenes are relit, increase supported file formats for RTX Remix\u2019s asset ingestor, and bolster RTX Remix\u2019s AI Texture Tools with new models.\nIn addition, the capabilities of RTX Remix Toolkit are now accessible via REST API, allowing modders to livelink RTX Remix to other DCC tools such as Blender, and generative AI apps such as ComfyUI. NVIDIA is also releasing an SDK for the RTX Remix runtime to allow modders to deploy RTX Remix\u2019s renderer into other applications and games beyond DirectX 8 and 9 classics.\nSince RTX Remix Toolkit launched earlier this year, 20,000 modders have experimented with using it to mod classic games, resulting in over 100 RTX remasters in development on the RTX Remix Showcase Discord. By continuing to open up the RTX Remix platform, we aim to enable and inspire modders across the globe to build even more amazing RTX remasters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe RTX Remix platform opens up with an open source Toolkit, Remix Runtime SDK, and REST API. Runtime screenshot from Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix Toolkit: Now Open Source\nMembers of the RTX Remix community have introduced new functionality and features for the RTX Remix Toolkit. By open sourcing the Toolkit, all modders can now contribute new features, tweaks and changes on our Toolkit GitHub.\nFollowing code review, these submissions may be selected to become part of our official Remix releases, bolstering the Toolkit\u2019s capabilities for every Remix modder, giving them more tools to create amazing\u00a0 mods and remasters of classic games.\nTo see contributions from other modders, head to the RTX Remix Showcase\u2019s tools channel. And if you\u2019re inspired to make your own Remix enhancement, be sure to submit to our open source GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix\u2019s REST API\nDevelopers can now use the REST API to connect RTX Remix with other applications, including DCC applications like Blender, ComfyUI, and ChaiNNer. While the RTX Remix Toolkit runs in the background, applications can work in lockstep with any of its functions.\nREST API is a gateway to the latest technologies, enabling modders to quickly remaster games by adding a huge amount of new functionality based on their needs. Connected applications unlock endless possibilities and allow modders the ability to mass process game assets as well as fine tune the smallest of details. The only limit is the creativity of the artist.\u00a0\nTo demonstrate one functionality of the RTX Remix REST API, we\u2019ve connected RTX Remix with the generative AI ecosystem of ComfyUI, and released the plugins as open source on this GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI can help quickly remaster game textures in high resolution and with physically accurate materials that work in concert with RTX Remix\u2019s full ray tracing. Save time by upgrading secondary assets with AI, with tools like ComfyUI, to enhance game textures or modified assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA TensorRT accelerates ComfyUI image generation by 60%, making Stable Diffusion workflows even faster on RTX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload The RTX Remix Beta Now\nIf you want to make your own ray-traced mod for a classic game, download the NVIDIA RTX Remix Beta and check out our tutorial videos to walk you through the setup process. Head to ModDB to find the latest RTX Remix mods and visit NVIDIA Studio to learn more about RTX-accelerated software, such as Adobe Substance and Blender.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see how modders and developers build on top of the fully open RTX Remix platform, and expand the ecosystem of games and applications it works with.

Chip giant posts 122% revenue jump.  Tamed guidance fails to please investors.  Illustration by TradingViewNot unusual for volatile AI play to see its valuation seesaw like a meme stock. The $3 trillion tech behemoth has seen worse. Nvidia stock NVDA shed as much as 10% in after-hours trading following the company\u2019s quarterly earnings results. The chip maker, which saw shares pare back the loss to 5% ahead of the opening bell Thursday, reported soaring revenue and earnings, both surpassing lofty consensus calls from analysts. Still, the spectacle ended with no fireworks as investors seemed to expect an even higher beat. But even that reaction was moderate compared to other performances.  Nvidia picked up revenue of $30 billion, up a whopping 122% from last year and above the $28.7 billion expected by Wall Street. Earnings per share arrived at 68 cents, up 152% year-on-year and above the 65 cents eyeballed by analysts. Net profit landed at $16.95 billion. What made things worse for the stock was the earnings call with CEO Jensen Huang, where he failed to spark investor excitement over the delayed Blackwell GPU.  Jensen said that the company would bring in \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d in revenue this fiscal year from the sales of its next-generation Blackwell chip. Also, for the current quarter, Nvidia didn\u2019t go too much above and beyond and this didn\u2019t sit well with overly optimistic forecasters. Nvidia stuck to revenue guidance of $32.5 billion, mildly exceeding the $31.7 billion expected. The company authorized a share buyback program of $50 billion.

The company has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, with its stock market value soaring to more than $3 trillion.But while analysts have grown used to Nvidia producing \"spectacular\" sales growth, the latest results indicate \"that rate of growth was starting to slow,\" said Simon French, head of research at Panmure Liberum.Analysts had forecast sales growth of $28.7bn for the three months to 28 July.Nvidia surpassed this with revenues increasing by 122% compared to the same period last year. But following the release of the results, Nvidia's share price fell by 6% in after-hours trading in New York on Wednesday. On Thursday, its shares were down about 2% in early trading, but its stock remains about 150% up so far in 2024, making it one of the big winners in the US market.Announcing the latest results, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said: \"Generative AI will revolutionise every industry.\"But Mr French told the BBC: \"If you\u2019re going to raise expectations that high then you\u2019ve got to keep growing at spectacular rates.\"He added that while its current AI chip - called Hopper - is selling well, the next generation Blackwell chip \"has faced some production delays and that perhaps is one of the reasons why Wall Street after hours sold off the stock\".Nvidia's results have become a quarterly event which sends Wall Street into a frenzy of buying and selling shares.A \"watch party\" had been planned in Manhattan, according to the Wall Street Journal, while Mr Huang, famed for his signature leather jacket, has been dubbed the \"Taylor Swift of tech\".Alvin Nguyen, senior analyst at Forrester, told the BBC both Nvidia and Mr Huang have become the \"face of AI\".This has helped the company so far, but it could also hurt its valuation if AI fails to deliver after firms have invested billions of dollars in the technology, Mr Nguyen said.\"A thousand use cases for AI is not enough. You need a million.\"Mr Nguyen also said Nvidia's first-mover advantage means it has market-leading products, which its customers have spent decades using and has a \"software ecosystem\".He said that rivals, such as Intel, could \"chip away\" at Nvidia's market share if they developed a better product, though he said this would take time.AI frenzy makes Nvidia the world's most valuable companyWhy is Nvidia boss the 'Taylor Swift of tech'?International BusinessArtificial intelligenceNvidiaRelatedThe Matrix film producer files for bankruptcy12 hrs agoBusinessSubsea fibre cables can 'listen out' for sabotage18 hrs agoTechnologyDisasters spur investment in flood and fire risk tech19 hrs agoMore12 hrs agoJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cryHerbie Hancock on 80 years of playing the piano and being this year's recipient of the Polar Music Prize.12 hrs agoCulture1 day agoMarket alters application rules after AI complaintsThe Alternative Market in Leeds will ask potential vendors to declare and describe any use of AI.1 day agoEngland2 days agoAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schoolsAllison Gardner says schools should be commended for using artificial intelligence in teaching.2 days agoStoke & Staffordshire4 days agoAlphonso the robot waiter delighting cafe visitorsThe robot is able to help serve and interact with customers, and has already caused a stir.4 days agoSuffolk5 days agoThe ex-Google exec who wants to simplify your lifeThe former Google and Yahoo executive believes AI should simplify our lives.5 days agoBusinessBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

Discover how to track all 535 Congress member stock trades today.\r\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia Corp NVDA stock traded lower as investors resorted to profit booking. The stock gained 193% in the last 12 months, backed by the artificial intelligence frenzy.\nAnalysts, including Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson and Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, hailed Nvidia as the critical AI play.\nApart from AI, Nvidia continues to target gaming technology by introducing its first digital human technology small language model, Nemotron-4 4B Instruct.\nAlso Read: Taiwan Semiconductor Expands to Europe with $11B Chip Plant in Germany: Report\nThe innovation will likely transform the gameplay experience by enhancing character interactions in the new multiplayer mech game Mecha BREAK, developed by Amazing Seasun Games, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Cloud Holdings KC.\nThe technology is optimized for GeForce RTX AI PCs and laptops, making it easier for developers to deploy advanced digital human technology in next-generation games like Mecha BREAK.\nNvidia has also unveiled a generative AI weather model that promises to revolutionize short-range weather forecasting. The new model, StormCast, marks a significant leap forward in predicting extreme weather events, such as flash floods and tornado outbreaks, with greater accuracy down to the kilometer scale, Axios reports.\nNvidia\u2019s StormCast can operate at the mesoscale level, which allows it to resolve small-scale weather systems and incorporate complex atmospheric physics, such as how thunderstorms form, intensify, and dissipate.\nAnalyst Rating: Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer reiterated an Outperform rating on Nvidia with a price target of $150.\nNvidia trades at 29x calendar year 2026 versus the five-year average of 36x. Schafer flagged the company\u2019s best-in-group gross and operating margin profile.\nNvidia remains the purest scale play on AI proliferation. Schafer said Data Center AI leads sustained structural growth as accelerator attach increases.\nHe noted that Nvidia\u2019s entrenched DC AI ecosystem is core to GenAI adoption. Schafer remains a long-term buyer.\nSchafer expects an upside for second-quarter results and third-quarter outlook, led by sustained cloud service providers\u00a0(CSPs) and enterprise AI demand.\nThe lead times have normalized despite the tight supply, which is gated by advanced packaging capacity. The B100 is on track for a low-volume fourth-quarter market introduction with a meaningful ramp in the first quarter as Chip-On-Wafer-On-Substrate-L\u00a0(CoWoS-L) supply improves.\nThe analyst expects Hopper to fill demand in the interim. Blackwell Ultra is anticipated by late fiscal 2025, Ruben+Vera due fiscal 2026, and Ruben Ultra by fiscal 2027.\nThe move to rack-scale leveraged Nvidia\u2019s unique end-to-end software connectivity accelerator platform. The analyst noted that GB200 NVL36 and GB200 NVL72 racks further separate Nvidia from the competition.\nSchafer projects second-quarter net sales and EPS of $28.04 billion and $0.62.\nPrice Action: NVDA stock traded lower by 1.50% to $128.08 at the last check Tuesday.\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia Hedge Fund Ownership Shifts, Citadel Cuts Stake While Renaissance Buys In: Report\n\nImage via Nvidia BlogNVDANVIDIA Corp$118.77-0.64%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewKCKingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd$19.035.54%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. In recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.

However, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors. Another critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. There has been lots of chatter around the second quarter earnings report of the firm in recent days, more so because of delays in the production of the new Blackwell chips that the firm is marketing as a game changer for AI data centers. However, experts in the chip domain have dismissed concerns around this hiccup, noting that demand for the H200 will more than make up for any delays in Blackwell production. NVIDIA claims that Blackwell shipping will begin at the back end of this year and accelerate in the first quarter of 2025.Wall Street analysts have been monitoring NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) closely ahead of the release of the second quarter earnings. Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating on the shares with a price target of $144. In a recent investor note, analyst Joseph Moore detailed that the advisory expected initial volumes of Blackwell in the October quarter, as the initial product was functional but with somewhat lower yields, and still expected a volume ramp of the next revision of silicon through January - all of which was still within the broad brush strokes of guidance.Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

The chipmaker's stock is up 159% year to date and has risen more than 60% over the last six months. Compare this to chip rival, Intel (INTC), which has seen its stock fall over 60% year to date. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.04 -2.49 (-2.08%)  As of 3:03:58 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA ^IXIC ^GSPC   Advanced Chart    The next big event for the market is the chip darling\u2019s earnings report, set for after the bell on Wednesday, as our Executive Editor Brian Sozzi excitedly pointed out. And it\u2019s not just Nvidia's stock that\u2019s on the line: Nvidia\u2019s closely watched results will set the pace for other artificial intelligence players. \u201cNvidia\u2019s report and guidance will be absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade,\u201d tech investor Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Intel Corporation (INTC)   Follow    View Quote Details    26.11 +0.42 (+1.63%)  As of 3:03:57 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    The past several weeks have been a roller-coaster ride for tech investors. Shares of AI giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are down over the past three months, with Alphabet falling more than 6% and both Amazon and Microsoft down more than 3%. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)   Follow    View Quote Details    193.52 -2.22 (-1.13%)  As of 3:03:53 PM EDT. Market Open.   AMZN MSFT GOOG   Advanced Chart    And second-tier AI players are struggling to regain traction as well. AMD (AMD) has fallen more than 16% since mid-July while Marvell Technology (MRVL) is off nearly 6% in the same period. But strong results from Nvidia could reignite some of that lost momentum, according to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives. \u201cNvidia is the heart and lungs of this bullish tech trade as the AI Revolution takes hold,\u201d Ives told me.  Ives, who expects a \u201cshock and awe\u201d quarter from Nvidia, said continued strong demand for the company\u2019s chips will have ripple effects across the industry. In a recent note to clients, Ives estimated that for every dollar spent on a Nvidia GPU chip, there is an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector. Bernstein\u2019s Mark Shmulik, who covers many of Nvidia's biggest customers including Meta (META), Amazon, and Google, told me the chip giant\u2019s results will be a critical driver of Big Tech\u2019s next move. \u201cNvidia is a bellwether of the 'Magnificent Seven' and AI trade,\u201d Shmulik explained. \u201cIf there is any softness, maybe rotation out of the Mag 7 picks up a little bit of steam, but listening to other tech earnings, core fundamentals keep delivering.\u201d So far this year, Nvidia\u2019s stock has soared. Shares are up 180% over the past year and up nearly 2,900% over the past five years \u2014 setting the bar very high for earnings this quarter. Estimates are for Nvidia's revenue to grow 112% in its latest quarter, marking a dramatic slowdown from over 250% growth one year ago. For Wall Street, the consensus remains bullish. KeyBanc, Citi, and Goldman Sachs were among those on the street who reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week ahead of results.   Story Continues While only time will tell whether Nvidia lives up to the hype this earnings season, it\u2019s safe to say the stakes are high.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).  No shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 7.7% in value last week. Still, the 146% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Ownership Breakdown August 31st 2024   What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth August 31st 2024   Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.5% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.  While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.   Story Continues Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$113b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NVIDIA   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The report noted that AWS' clusters each have 20,000 H100s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nGlobalFoundries and Quantum Motion partner on development of quantum processors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 Nov 2024\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\nHypertec introduces the world\u2019s most advanced immersion-born GPU server: Sustainability, exceptional density, and optimized performance for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in North America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Leadership Summit 2025 - Sponsorship Brochure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nIRS purchases Nvidia DGX B200 SuperPOD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Dec 2024\n\n\n\n\nDOE: Data centers consumed 4.4% of US power in 2023, could hit 12% by 2028\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nNvidia A100\n\n\nA100\n\n\nTab Schadt\n\n\nLiftr Insights\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nNvidia H100\n\n\nH100\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.  If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  NVIDIA's Improving Profits Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$0.19 to US$1.73 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.  Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of NVIDIA shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 17% to 60% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts. In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue History August 22nd 2024   Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NVIDIA. Are NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders? Since NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$3.1t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$123b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!   Story Continues Does NVIDIA Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?NVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.Although NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Tech stages powerful comeback.  Blackwell GPU to be delayed.  Illustration by TradingViewNouveau riche boss scaled down his fortunes to $89 billion after the wipeout session cost the chipmaker $170 billion. Nvidia stock NVDA led the broad-based technology rout on Monday, losing 6.3% of its market cap, or $170 billion, to sit on $2.5 trillion. The painful downturn cost the company\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang as much as $6 billion thanks to his 3% stake in the chipmaker. Huang now boasts a personal fortune of $89 billion, taking the 16th place on the world\u2019s richest list. This year, Jensen has been the biggest nouveau riche person, adding $45 billion to his net worth.  Recession worries swept markets out there with tech taking the biggest hammering due to their volatile nature and, some would say, lofty and frothy valuations. Traders sold off shares of tech giants in fears that the Federal Reserve had missed the window of opportunity to lower interest rates and now it may be too late. Fortunately, a powerful rebound took place on Tuesday with stock futures all shooting higher.  Back to Nvidia, weighing on the stock further was a weekend report that said one of the company\u2019s next-generation chips \u2014 Blackwell GPU \u2014 may be delayed over a just-discovered design flaw. Nvidia\u2019s massive chips are largely responsible for building out the infrastructure layer of the artificial intelligence wave that is sweeping across the tech industry. These chips are also behind the monster gains in Nvidia\u2019s share price \u2014 up 108% year to date.

The solution lets customers and claimants notify the insurer about their claim, take photos of their vehicle in the event of an accident, and provide documentation needed for settlement while detecting and reducing insurance fraud.\nThe solution automatically classifies the content of images, such as vehicle photos or documentation (e.g., license or registration). ControlExpert uses vision AI to identify vehicle information like make, model, color, and license plate. Based on images of vehicle damage, ControlExpert also developed AI models to segment visible vehicle parts and precisely detect the severity of the damage, generating a detailed description of the damage as well as cost estimation for repairs.\u00a0 For the solution to accurately assess the damage, ControlExpert developed AI-based fraud prevention that analyzes and detects manipulated images.\nInsurance companies process millions of non-standardized documentation each day, which can be very time-consuming for claim agents.\u00a0 Using NLP, AI models can extract and analyze data from documentation, including invoices, appraisals, and emails, to provide a decision about claim payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of ControlExpert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Specifications\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \t\n                        \t\n                            \tSoftware: NVIDIA AI Enterprise (Triton Inference Server, PyTorch), VMware vSphere\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \t\n                        \t\n                            \tHardware: NVIDIA A100 GPUs, Dell R750\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Why NVIDIA AI Enterprise?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \t\n                        \t\n                            \tNVIDIA-accelerated performance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \t\n                        \t\n                            \tStreamlined development with included AI tools and frameworks\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n                        \t\n                        \t\n                            \tReliability and stability with regular security patches and long-term support branches\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Building an AI Solution for End-to-End Claims Management\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControlExpert turned to NVIDIA AI to develop an end-to-end claims management solution.

One of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.  Some of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times. This exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.   Story Continues Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has been hit recently amid a broader selloff in the tech sector and reports of delays in the production of new AI chips branded Blackwell. However, the bigger picture remains rosy. The company has taken measures to ease investor concerns on the new chip, AI labs of the firm have been upsizing and lengthening their instance commitments, and enterprises are rapidly growing as a proportion of the demand mix. All these indicators point towards a bullish outlook for the AI giant.Analysts led by Timothy Arcuri at investment advisory UBS have also recently backed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to emerge from the Blackwell troubles unscathed, reiterating a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $150. Arcuri and his team noted that initial Blackwell customer volume shipments were only delayed four to six weeks at most, putting them at the very end of January 2025. This delay, per the team, was likely to be filled in large by customers taking more H200 chips due to very short lead times.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's other top stock picks. Jim Cramer reacted to Monday\u2019s market by questioning if there\u2019s any money left to invest and why mutual funds aren\u2019t holding enough cash. The S&P 500 fell 17.77 points, or 0.3%, to 5,616.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.44 points, or 0.2% to 41,240.52. The Nasdaq composite fell 152.03 points, or 0.9%, to 17,725.76. \u201cWhat do we do if we\u2019re out of money? Don\u2019t mutual funds have enough cash? That\u2019s my reaction to today\u2019s market action. Right now, mutual funds know they have to pivot out of consistent growth stocks, especially tech stocks like software and semiconductors, which don\u2019t benefit from rate cuts. They need to swap into companies that can supercharge their earnings as the Fed lowers rates. We all recognize that cyclical stocks, the ones that benefit from lower rates, can go higher, maybe much higher.\u201d  Cramer pointed out that mutual funds now need to shift away from consistent growth stocks, particularly in tech sectors like software and semiconductors, which don\u2019t benefit from interest rate cuts. Instead, they should move towards companies that can boost their earnings as the Federal Reserve reduces rates. \u201cWhat\u2019s painful for many of you are the declines in stocks of companies with consistent earnings. These companies, especially tech firms, don\u2019t really need lower rates, and they\u2019re selling off as money managers raise capital to rotate into the rate-cut winners.  Cramer explained that cyclical stocks, which tend to perform better with lower rates, are likely to rise, possibly significantly. However, the decline in stocks of companies with stable earnings, especially in tech, is troubling for many investors. These stocks are being sold off as money managers raise capital to invest in those poised to benefit from rate cuts.  Cramer emphasized that it\u2019s important to understand who the winners and losers are in this situation. The winners include two groups: high-dividend-yield stocks and cyclical companies expected to see earnings growth from lower rates, particularly in the housing sector. Cramer noted that housing stocks, which had seen significant gains, were down on Monday because hedge funds and mutual funds had bought heavily before the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting. While mutual funds are holding on, hedge funds are cashing in their profits, as these stocks had sharp increases before the event. For traders, taking profits after such a successful trade is standard practice.   Story Continues \u201cLet\u2019s start with the most direct beneficiaries: housing. These stocks were all down today because hedge funds and mutual funds bought them aggressively ahead of Friday\u2019s Jackson Hole verdict. Mutual funds are staying long, but hedge funds are ringing the register furiously because they\u2019ve made so much money. Housing stocks had parabolic moves going into the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference, so now these portfolio managers are just taking profits. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do with a successful trade if you\u2019re a trader. Cramer believes that while the housing trade may be over for traders, the housing investment story isn\u2019t finished. He also warned that the recent reversal in housing stocks could limit their potential, as investors are wary of the technical trends.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, though. This kind of reversal I\u2019m talking about can be hideous. Some of these stocks are very close to their highs, and I don\u2019t like that.\u201d Cramer cautioned that these kinds of reversals can be severe and might discourage new buyers. He reminded everyone that by the time the Federal Reserve signals a clear path forward, it might be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. According to Cramer, it\u2019s better to wait for these stocks to pull back and recharge before making a move.\u201cThose who have them can hold on, but they flew too close to the sun to attract new buyers. Remember, I\u2019ve said all along that by the time the Fed gives the all-clear, it may be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. You have to let them recharge, let them come down, and then you can pull the trigger.\u201d Our MethodologyIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money and picked the ten notable stocks he mentioned. We also explore what hedge funds think about these stocks and rank them based on how many hedge funds own them, from the fewest to the most.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Jim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the brutal market selloff of Monday and said days like these could make you \u201ccry yourself to sleep.\u201d Cramer said that this \u201cnasty\u201d selloff was expected.  \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect at this point in the rate cycle, the point where the Fed is about to start cutting rates to bolster the economy. But the economy is going down,\u201d Cramer said. Cramer said that the Monday selloff was \u201cvicious enough\u201d to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that\u2019s exactly \u201cwhat you have to do.\u201d He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Jim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their \u201cpants down\u201d when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it\u2019s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet \u201cuntil we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.\u201d   StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.   Cramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn\u2019t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he\u2019d do it. \u201cHe\u2019s got horse sense,\u201d Cramer said.  Jim Cramer said there are no \u201csafe havens\u201d in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for \u201cpain\u201d in the near term if they want to invest in technology. \u201cIf you can\u2019t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.\u201d  For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Is Jim Cramer is Talking About NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Amid Global Selloff?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 Jim Cramer in a latest program reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doing \u201camazing things\u201d with generative AI and accelerated computing and they don\u2019t have anything to do with the Fed. Despite this, Cramer said that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has \u201cbecome a wasteland.\u201d   Story Continues Cramer said he does not see NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) decline stopping here mainly because the company does not benefit from the upcoming rate cuts.Cramer thinks the market\u2019s earnings estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is low, and \u201cmaybe\u201d the company can earn $4.59 next year, which means it\u2019s trading at 23x earnings.\u201cI am not selling the greatest growth stock of our generation\u201d at 23 times earnings, Cramer said. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\u201cVisibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,\u201d the firm said. However, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company\u2019s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won\u2019t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.Raymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has \u201ctriggered a mechanical sell signal\u201d based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research last month downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.However, New Street upgraded the stock recently after the latest selloff and set a price target of $120, saying:\u201cWe find the correction healthy overall, recognize some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, but overall see the stock moves as an opportunity to gain more exposure.\" Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that  Intel remains dominant in the tech sector. Cramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions. \"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.  In a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won\u2019t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue. \"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"  Cramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened. \"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"  The same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.   Story Continues \"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\" Discussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\" Cramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors:186NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands to gain substantially from the surging demand for AI, particularly as more companies and researchers invest in AI development. The continuous growth in AI training within data centers is the main force driving NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s revenue.Although AI technology is expected to advance significantly over the next decade, the current demand already signals a strong outlook for NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s business. UBS analysts anticipate a 27% increase in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from its current $118 price, which would raise its forward price-to-earnings ratio to 54, indicating strong confidence in Nvidia's future growth.Jim Cramer emphasizes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s CEO, Jensen Huang, has been confidently stating that purchasing Nvidia chips could potentially quadruple returns. He stresses that this isn't a mere speculation but a reality, and questions how much anyone has actually gained by betting against Huang's predictions over the years.\"Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?\" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Interestingly, this company won the award for the single most important earnings report of 2024 (and every quarter in 2023) when it reported three months ago!  I am talking about Nvidia (NVDA). Earnings are out on Aug. 28 after the close of trading, and it could mean big things for the AI trade as Morning Brief co-host Seana Smith points out. Every day, I get to the office by 4:20 a.m. and turn on some software we use to track which stories and ticker pages are garnering the most interest from Yahoo Finance readers. Every single day, one of the most actively viewed pages on our platform is for Nvidia. The world could be on the cusp of an alien attack, and I fancy people will still be hitting refresh on the Nvidia ticker page. Investors have become absolutely obsessed with a company they had never even heard of two years ago. I can't blame them. Nvidia's stock is up 170% in the past year. Nvidia's stock is up 3,000% in the past five years. These are insane gains, the type that lure in the less-experienced investor hoping to retire early. And Nvidia's story is surprisingly easy to grasp despite the company's incredibly complicated business. Nvidia makes the best artificial intelligence chips in a world being upheaved by AI. Simple. No one is even close to Nvidia in terms of AI chip performance and forward-looking demand. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.10 -2.43 (-2.03%)  As of 3:04:15 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA AMD   Advanced Chart    I do want to caution that the setup on Nvidia going into the quarterly report is a little different this go around. While the Street is staying super bullish on Nvidia heading into the print, they are a touch cautious amid reported shipment delays for Nvidia's powerful new AI chip Blackwell. There is good reason for the bullishness based on a host of recent signals from earnings reports: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just cited strong AI demand when it reported. AMD (AMD) recently lifted its sales for data center chips for the third time in a year. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cited strong demand for its liquid cooling solutions. Nvidia chip customer Meta (META) just raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 and 2025 by billions.   \"We expect Nvidia to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs. Given the Blackwell delay, we believe Nvidia will prioritize the ramp of B200 for hyperscalers and has effectively canceled B100, which will be replaced with a lower cost/performance GPU (B200A) targeted at enterprise customers,\" Keybanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note.   Story Continues For Nvidia's report to be embraced, I think investors need to see at least two things:Nvidia must convey that reported Blackwell shipment delays aren't a structural issue. Nvidia must show strong quarter-over-quarter sales growth in its data center business. If this happens, it could shake off a few bears and set the table for what EMJ Capital founder and tech investor Eric Jackson told me on the Opening Bid podcast.\"I'm saying [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" Jackson said.To put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.2 trillion or so currently.Jackson reasons the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report this week or in November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.Rest up. It's going to be a busy week ahead.Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

The company also said it expects Q3 revenue ahead of guidance. Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 on revenue of $30 billion in its fiscal second quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.64 and revenue of $28.8 billion. That marks a 122% increase on the top line from a year ago; earnings rose 168% from the same quarter last year. The company also provided third quarter revenue guidance of $32.5 billion plus or minus 2%. Analysts were looking for $31.9 billion. The stock fell as much as 6% in immediate reaction to the numbers.   The bulk of that revenue came from Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center business, which brought in $26.3 billion in the quarter versus Wall Street's expectations of $25 billion in revenue. That's a 154% increase from the same period last year when the segment brought in $10.3 billion. In a statement, CEO Jensen Huang said anticipation for the company's next-generation Blackwell chip is \"incredible.\"  CFO Colette Kress said in a statement, \"Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\" Kress's statement added that the company \"executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield.\" The company expects shipments of its current Hopper chips to \"increase\" in the second half of the year. Nvidia also announced Wednesday a $50 billion increase in its share buyback authorization. The company had $7.5 billion remaining on its existing authorization at the end of the quarter. Nvidia's gaming division, which used to stand as the company's breadwinner, saw revenue of $2.8 billion, up 16% year over year. Nvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. The company has also been key to the current AI trade on Wall Street, with almost half of its revenue tied directly to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta.   Nvidia\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t resting on their laurels. Earlier this month, AMD announced it is acquiring ZT Systems in a deal valued at $4.9 billion. The move gives AMD more firepower to build out AI system servers, something that\u2019s been a major catalyst for Nvidia\u2019s own sales. And while it could provide AMD with a boost in sales, it doesn\u2019t mean Nvidia will face any major threats to its reign as the AI king anytime soon.   Story Continues \"There are emerging competitors like AMD that are starting to take a little bit of market share,\" Stifel managing director Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance Monday. \"But when you look at the overall infrastructure spend cycle \u2026 which we think is going to continue to increase, Nvidia appears to us as the best positioned to benefit from [spending].\"  Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo FinanceEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Still, today's price action was muted as investors look ahead to tomorrow's quarterly earnings report from Nvidia (NVDA, +1.5%), which has become a key event on Wall Street.\u00a0Indeed, Nvidia earnings will be released after Wednesday's close and Wall Street is anxiously awaiting the outcome. \"NVDA results have been a key driver of the broader market short term, and the stock has added roughly 5 percentage points to S&P 500 returns for the year to date,\" says BofA Securities.In a separate note, BofA analyst Vivek Arya calls Nvidia a \"top sector pick\" ahead of earnings. He adds that any issues related to potential delays of its Blackwell chip will be limited and unlikely to \"fundamentally derail NVDA's longer-term momentum.\" Arya also says that any selloff in the chip stock should be viewed as an \"enhanced buying opportunity.\"\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nSuper Micro Computer slumps after short seller reportElsewhere in the tech space, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) was down nearly 9% at its session low before ending the day with a milder 2.6% drop. Today's pressure came courtesy of Hindenburg Research, which revealed a short position in SMCI. The firm also accused Super Micro Computer, which makes artificial intelligence (AI) servers, of \"accounting manipulation.\"SMCI \"benefited as an early mover but still faces significant accounting, governance and compliance issues and offers an inferior product and service now being eroded away by more credible competition,\" Hindenburg wrote in its report.The stock had a red-hot start to 2024 and had more than quadrupled for the year to date back in March. It has struggled more recently amid disappointing earnings and concerns about reduced AI spending, paring its return to about 93%.Paramount Global falls on M&A newsParamount Global (PARA) fell 7.2% after Edgar Bronfman Jr, the former chairman and CEO of Warner Music Group, abandoned his bid to buy the media company amid reports he could not secure funding.\u00a0Bronfman threw his hat into the ring earlier this month, adding \"one more twist to the long and winding road of Paramount Global's sale process,\" says Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner (Sell). \"The process has gone through so many convolutions and resulted in such destruction of shareholder value.\"With Bronfman out, it appears that Skydance Media is in the clear to close on its purchase of Paramount Global.Home prices keep risingIn economic news, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index showed home prices were up 5.4% year-over-year in June. While this is slower than the 5.9% annual gain seen in May, it's the largest rise for June on record.\u00a0New York, San Diego and Las Vegas saw the biggest increases in home prices, while Portland saw the smallest.Consumer confidence improves in AugustSeparate data from The Conference Board showed folks are hesitant to buy a home. Indeed, on a six-month moving average basis, purchasing plans for homes fell to a 12-year low in August.\u00a0Overall, The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose to 103.3 in August from July's upwardly revised 103.3.\"Consumers continued to express mixed feelings in August,\" said Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. \"Compared to July, they were more positive about business conditions, both current and future, but also more concerned about the labor market.\" She adds that consumers were also a little less positive about future income.As for the main indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.02% gain to 41,250 \u2013 a new record close \u2013 the S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,625, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to 17,754.\n\nTrack all markets on TradingView\nRelated contentCan a President Fix Inflation?Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Earnings?Kiplinger's Earnings Calendar and Analysis\n\nTOPICS\n\nS&P 500\nDow Jones Industrial Average\nNasdaq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Kiplinger Today newsletter \u2014 freeProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

Discover how to track all 535 Congress member stock trades today.\r\nTechnology giant NVIDIA Corp NVDA has been one of the top-performing stocks of the past year, boosted by its role in the growth of artificial intelligence use cases. The growth could continue after beating analyst estimates in the second quarter.\nWhile many investors have bought Nvidia shares or have exposure to the stock through ETFs, here's a look back at how much the lucky and perhaps wise investors who bought shares of Nvidia at IPO would have made.\nInvesting $1,000 in Nvidia at IPO: Nvidia became one of the most valuable companies in the world in May 2023, passing the $1 trillion market capitalization level.\nSince that time, the company went on to pass the $2 trillion and $3 trillion market capitalization levels, even briefly becoming the most valuable public company in the world in 2024.\nBack in 1999, Nvidia held its initial price offering on Jan. 22, with shares priced at $12 each.\nA $1,000 investment in the company would have been able to buy 83.33 shares at the time.\nSince its IPO, Nvidia had several stock splits that increased the number of shares held by shareholders. The stock had 2:1 splits in 2000, 2001 and 2006, a 3:2 split in 2007, a 4:1 split in July 2021 and the most recent 10:1 split in June 2024.\nToday, the original 83.33 shares would total 39,998.4 shares after the stock splits.\nThe original $1,000 investment in Nvidia stock would be worth $4,826,606.93 based on a share price of $120.67. This represents a huge return for Nvidia IPO buyers with some potential millionaires created over the years.\nHere\u2019s a look at the return of Nvidia since its IPO with a Benzinga Pro Chart below. \n\nFor comparison, the same $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500, would have underperformed Nvidia.\nA $1,000 investment in SPY stock could have bought 12.82 shares at the time, based on an adjusted price of $78.03 on Jan. 22, 1999.\nThe $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust would be worth $7,208.56 today.\nRead Also: Nvidia Analysts Say Pullback Is Buying Opportunity: \u2018Pushing AI Envelope Too Significant To Slow Down\u2019\nWhat Happened:\u00a0Nvidia CEO\u00a0Jensen Huang\u00a0highlighted the company\u2019s growth\u00a0with increased interest in artificial intelligence at its GTC 2024 event.\n\u201cThere is absolutely something happening, something going on. The industry is being transformed,\u201d Huang said.\nThe Nvidia CEO and co-founder called the computer the single most important instrument today, because it affects every industry.\nWhile Huang and Nvidia saw technology advancement coming, the CEO said\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0helped capture the imagination of consumers and the capabilities of AI.\n\u201cA new industry has emerged.\u201d\nSince its\u00a0founding\u00a0in 1993, Nvidia has sought to be at the forefront of technological advancements to help new industrial advancements.\nIn 1999, the company invented the Graphics Processing Unit, commonly known as GPU today. The GPU redefined the computer industry.\nIn 2012, Nvidia ushered in the modern era of AI with the AlexNet neural network, potentially showing the company ahead of others when it came to belief in the capabilities of artificial intelligence.\nIn March 2024. the company\u00a0unveiled the\u00a0Blackwell GPU,\u00a0which could help the company further disrupt the growth of artificial intelligence.\nNvidia continues to draw praise from analysts as one of the best plays on the growth of artificial intelligence.\nThe big question for investors today is if Nvidia will keep outperforming the overall market and be one of the top-performing stocks going forward.\nThe Benzinga Pro chart below of Nvidia stock over the past five years shows the surge in the share price.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCongress Is Making Huge Investments.

She\u2019s a self-taught robotics developer \u2014 in building IC4U, she used the Jetson Developer Kit as a sandbox to explore and experiment.\nShe is a member of AI4ALL, a nonprofit program with the mission to make AI more diverse and inclusive, and the New York Academy of Science. A global presence in the robotics scene, she\u2019s been recognized at the European Youth Awards and Women in Tech Global Awards events. She placed first in the 2021 Istanbul Bosphorus Robot Cup and third at the 2023 OpenCV AI Competition.\nHer Inspiration\nOrnek\u2019s inspiration for creating IC4U came from a trip to France, where she saw a guide dog assisting its owner. Her late dog, Korsan, was also a key source of inspiration.\n\u201cI started to think about if a visually impaired person lost their dog, not only would they lose their best friend, but their eyes,\u201d Ornek said.\n\nThe project was built to offer the visually impaired a companion not limited by aging and health.\nHer Jetson Project\nOrnek initially used ultrasonic sensors located in IC4U\u2019s eyes to detect obstacles. But after attending the 2021 World Summit AI as a panelist, she decided to develop new AI applications for the robot dog that\u2019d enable it to mimic a real one.\nThe ultrasonic sensors only offered object detection from directly in front of IC4U, and Ornek wanted to expand detection to the robot\u2019s entire surroundings.\nThe solution was using sound sensors located in the robot\u2019s ears. IC4U can turn toward a sound and process visual information gathered by an integrated ZED 2i Wide-Angle 3D AI camera, which captures a wider range of visual data and helps detect information such as the size and speed of an object.\n\n\u201cTo power the ZED 2i camera and for high-quality image processing, I used an NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit,\u201d Ornek said. \u201cI was so impressed with the ZED 2i camera\u2019s performance that I didn\u2019t want to limit its use to a simple object-recognition task.\u201d\nShe began to think of other ways that IC4U could assist a visually impaired person. IC4U\u2019s improved data processing from high-resolution sensors, powered by Jetson, enables it to detect city objects such as stop signs, traffic light colors and the denomination of paper money.\n\nIn addition, Ornek used the Jetson Nano to add a shopping feature to IC4U via web scraping from publicly available resources, aiming to one day expand it by partnering with online retail stores.\nBack to School\nIn the long run, Ornek hopes to deploy IC4U for use in smart cities and spaces \u2014 continuing her exploration of AI applications with next-generation platforms like Jetson Orin.\nThis fall, she\u2019ll begin studying computer science at the University of British Columbia on a full scholarship, as a recipient of the Karen McKellin International Leader of Tomorrow Award. She strives to encourage other youth, especially girls, that technology is fun.\nStudents and educators with a valid accredited university or education-related email address can sign up to purchase the Jetson Orin Nano or Jetson AGX Orin Developer Kit at a discounted rate. U.S.-based students and educators can visit Sparkfun to sign up for their discount \u2014 residents of other countries should check their eligibility (login required).\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Jetson platform and NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Jetson AI courses and certifications.\n\n\nCategories: Inner Geek | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning Institute | Education | NVIDIA Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Investors were still disappointed.      Daniel Howley   \u00b7 Technology Editor  August 30, 2024 4 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMD   -0.64%    NVDA   -2.04%     INTC   +1.58%      Sometimes your best just isn\u2019t good enough. That\u2019s the lesson Nvidia (NVDA) learned Wednesday after the company\u2019s stock price fell 3% despite posting better-than-expected second quarter earnings and guidance for the third quarter. It\u2019s not as though the company\u2019s growth was unimpressive, either. Revenue jumped 122% year over year to $30 billion, up from $13.5 billion. Nvidia\u2019s all-important data center revenue topped out at $26.3 billion, a 154% year-over-year increase. But that wasn\u2019t the kind of blowout that investors have quickly grown accustomed to over the last few quarters. Beyond investor sentiment, Wall Street analysts have also seemingly caught on to Nvidia\u2019s growth after several quarters of big surprises to the upside.   Nvidia\u2019s revenue reported Wednesday beat Wall Street expectations by 4.1%, the slimmest margin since the fourth quarter of its 2023 fiscal year. As Nvidia\u2019s business has boomed over the last two years, the company\u2019s revenue topped Wall Street forecasts by double-digit percentage points for three straight quarters, including a 22% difference in its fiscal second quarter of 2024.  And as Wall Street appears to have gotten a better feel for Nvidia\u2019s growth at this point in the AI investment cycle, questions have also arisen about the status of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chip. Ahead of the company\u2019s earnings announcement, the Information reported that the chip, the follow-up to Nvidia\u2019s Hopper line, faced delays that could impact some of the company\u2019s biggest customers including Microsoft and Google. In her quarterly comments, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress explained that the company made changes to Blackwell to improve its production yield. CEO Jensen Huang, meanwhile, said that the chip is currently being sampled to customers, a major step toward shipping the processor at volume. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.10 -2.43 (-2.03%)  As of 3:04:15 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA INTC AMD   Advanced Chart    Huang said the company expects to ship several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter. But the CEO couldn\u2019t pin down exactly how much revenue Blackwell would generate, despite analysts\u2019 questions. Huang, however, did provide a number of other strong points for Nvidia, including pointing out that demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply. The CEO also said that Nvidia\u2019s Hopper platform will continue to grow in the second half of the year, and explained that the company expects its data center business to grow \u201cquite significantly next year.\u201d Huang also said that AI inferencing is driving the company\u2019s data center revenue. Inferencing refers to computers running AI programs and providing users with answers to their queries.   Story Continues   Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia, speaks at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSThat should put to rest fears of threats to Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth as companies pivot from training AI models to using inference. Huang appears to believe that Nvidia will continue to plow forward as customers use its chips to both train and run their AI models.Nvidia is still the world leader in AI chips, and it\u2019ll be some time before rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) catch up to its hardware and software lead. And while Nvidia may be facing a near-term decline in its stock price, Wall Street is still on board.In an investor note released following Nvidia\u2019s earnings, BofA\u2019s Vivek Arya raised his price target on the chip designer to $165 from $150 per share, writing, \u201cDespite the quarterly noise, we continue to believe in [Nvidia\u2019s] unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 [years] of what is at least a 3 to 4-year upfront investment cycle.\u201dRaymond James\u2019s Srini Pajjuri also raised the firm\u2019s price target on Nvidia\u2019s stock from $120 to $140, writing in an investor note that \u201cBlackwell delays appear better than feared and management is forecasting a strong ramp in FQ4.\u201dPajjuri also said demand for Nvidia\u2019s current-generation Hopper chip continues to be healthy and pointed to anticipated sales growth in Q4, despite Blackwell production ramping up at the same time.Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore, who raised his price target for Nvidia from $144 to $150, called out Nvidia's sky-high expectations with regards to the company's stock moves after the earnings report.\"Expectations become more challenging as the superlative becomes mundane, but this was still a very strong quarter given the transitional nature of the current environment.\"Whether that\u2019s enough to satisfy investors next quarter remains to be seen.

Ten people who either worked at the company or are still employed there described the environment as a pressure cooker in which meetings often descend into shouting matches, according to Bloomberg News. A former marketing employee at Nvidia told Bloomberg News that she would often attend up to 10 meetings per day \u2014 each of them involving more than 30 people.   Current and former employees at Nvidia described a grueling work environment that entails long hours and shouting matches. AP   The meetings would be characterized by shouting and fighting, but employees put up with it because of the \u201cgolden handcuffs,\u201d according to the ex-staffer. Nvidia, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based maker of semiconductors used to power artificial intelligence technology, boasts a relatively low worker attrition rate due to the fact that its employees are given stock grants that typically vest over a four-year period. Since 2019, Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged by 3,776% \u2014 meaning employees who have been working at the company for the past five years are likely to be millionaires.   Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has steered the company during a period when its stock price has soared by more than 3,700%. AP   The company has become the dominant chipmaker as demand for its semiconductors has grown in parallel with the rise of artificial intelligence. According to Bloomberg News, the stock compensation package is a powerful incentive for employees to withstand the grind and remain at the company. Last year, 5.3% of employees left Nvidia. But after the company\u2019s market capitalization exceeded $1 trillion, the rate of worker attrition fell to just 2.7%.  In the semiconductor industry, the rate of employee turnover is much higher \u2014 17.7%, according to Nvidia. A former engineer at Nvidia told Bloomberg News that those who have been with the company for a decade have more than enough money to retire, but instead are choosing to work more because of a larger windfall that awaits them when the next stock grant vests. The former engineer also said he would often hear newly minted multimillionaire employees at the company brag about new vacation homes they were buying. He told Bloomberg News that it was also routine to see many of them snap up tickets for events such as the Super Bowl and the NBA Finals. Nvidia\u2019s employee parking lot is also full of high-end cars such as Porsches, Corvettes and Lamborghinis, according to Bloomberg News.   Nvidia has become the dominant chip-maker whose products are used to power artificial intelligence products. REUTERS   A real estate agent based in nearly Palo Alto, Calif., told Bloomberg News that he has worked with several Nvidia employees \u2014 some of whom make down payments of between 40% and 60% on homes worth millions of dollars.   Story Continues Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in an interview that he pushes employees hard because \u201cif you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201dThe Post has sought comment from Nvidia.

But as much as investors would like to believe CEO Jensen Huang's graphics processor empire will continue to grow, doubling quarter after quarter, nothing lasts forever.\nAs The Next Platform's Timothy Prickett Morgan predicted on last week's episode of The Register\u2019s Kettle podcast, Nvidia's revenues will one day plateau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Nvidia's future revolved solely around selling GPUs and nothing else, that might be a big deal. But as Huang frequently reminds folks, Nvidia is every bit as much a software business as a hardware one.\nEnabling new markets\nFrom early on, Nvidia recognized the value of software to drive the adoption of GPUs. During a fireside chat with journalist Lauren Goode at SIGGRAPH last week, Huang drove home this point.\n\"Every time we introduce a domain specific library, it exposes accelerated computing to a new market,\" he explained. \"It's not just about building the accelerator, you have to build the whole stack.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first release of Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture \u2013 better known now as CUDA \u2013 came in 2007 and provided an API interface for parallelizing non-graphics workloads across GPUs. While this still required developers and researchers to refactor code, the improvements over general-purpose processors were hard to ignore.\nThis was especially true for those in the HPC community \u2013 one of the first markets Nvidia pursued outside its old territories of gaming and professional graphics. In late 2012, Nvidia software investments helped to put the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Titan supercomputer in the number one spot on the Top500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventeen years after its initial release, CUDA is just one of an ever-growing list of compute frameworks tailored to specific markets \u2013 ranging from deep learning to computational lithography and quantum computing emulation.\nThose frameworks helped Nvidia to create markets for its accelerators where little to none previously existed.\nGoing beyond enablement\nSoftware is Nvidia's not-so-secret weapon, but until recently that weapon has taken the form of enablement. Over the past two years we've seen the accelerator champ's software strategy embrace a subscription pricing model in a meaningful way.\nIn early 2022, months before OpenAI's ChatGPT set off the AI gold rush, Nvidia CFO Collete Kress detailed the GPU giant's subscription fuelled roadmap \u2013 which, she opined, would eventually drive a trillion dollars in revenues.\nAt the time, Kress predicted $150 billion of that opportunity would be driven by Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite. Even now that it's posting $26 billion quarters, the business is still well short of that trillion-dollar goal \u2013 but we are starting to get a better picture of how it may grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a software standpoint, much of the work on AI enablement has already been done. Nvidia has poured enormous resources into developing tools like cuDNN, TensorRT LLM, and Triton Inference Service to get the most out of its hardware when running AI models.\nHowever these are just pieces of a puzzle that must be carefully assembled and tuned to extract that performance, and tuning is going to be different for each model. It takes a level of familiarity with the model, software, and underlying hardware that enterprises are unlikely to have.\nBuilding an AI easy button\nAt its GTC event last northern spring Nvidia revealed a new offering designed to lower the barrier to adopting and deploying generative AI at scale. That technology \u2013 called Nvidia Inference Microservices, or NIMs for short \u2013 essentially consists of containerized models and tools which ship with everything you need to run them preconfigured.\nNIM containers can be deployed across just about any runtime that supports Nvidia's GPUs. That might not sound that exciting \u2013 but it's kind of the point. Container orchestration isn't exactly an easy problem to solve \u2013 just ask the Kubernetes devs. So why reinvent the wheel, when you can make use of existing tools and services in which customers are already invested?\nThe real value of NIMs seems to come from Nvidia engineers tuning things like TensorRT LLM or Triton Inference Server for specific models or use cases, like retrieval augmented generation (RAG). If you're not familiar, you can find our hands-on guide on RAG here, but the takeaway is that Nvidia is playing system integrator not only with its hardware, but with its software as well.\nNIMs are not just clever packaging. By working toward a common API for how models and tools should communicate with one another, Nvidia can provide customers with templates designed to address specific use cases.\nNvidia's pricing ladder\nA lower barrier to adoption and deployment of AI inferencing has upsides for both software licensing and hardware sales. On the software side of things, the AI Enterprise license necessary to deploy NIMs in production will set you back $4,500 per GPU per year, or $1 per GPU per hour.\nSo to deploy Meta's Llama 3.1 405B model with NIMs you'd not only need to rent or buy a system with 8x H100s or H200s \u2013 the minimum necessary to run the model without resorting to more aggressive levels of quantization \u2013 but you'd also be looking at $36,000/yr or $8/hr in licensing fees.\nAssuming a useful lifespan of six years, that works out to between $180,000 to $420,480 in license revenues \u2013 per system \u2013 depending on whether you pay up front or by the hour. And realistically, enterprises looking to deploy AI are going to need more than one system for both redundancy and scale.\nThat price delta might make committing to an annual license seem like an obvious choice. But remember that we're talking about microservices that, if implemented properly, should be able to scale up or down depending on demand.\nBut, let's say Llama 3.1 405B is a little overkill for your needs and running a smaller model \u2013 a far less costly L40S or even L4S \u2013 might suffice. Nvidia's pricing structure is set up in a way that it drives customers toward more powerful and capable accelerators.\nThe AI Enterprise license costs the same regardless of whether you're running eight L40Ss or eight H200s. This creates a scenario where it may well be more economical to buy or rent fewer high-end GPUs and run the model at higher batch sizes or queues \u2013 since your license fees will be lower over the lifetime of the deployment.\nAnd with single A100 and H100 instances becoming more common \u2013 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, for example, announced availability last week \u2013 this is something that enterprises may want to take into consideration when evaluating the total cost of such a deployment.\n\nNvidia reportedly delays Blackwell GPUs until 2025 over packaging issues\nDoJ launches probes as AI antitrust storm clouds gather round Nvidia\nIntel to shed at least 15% of staff, will outsource more to TSMC, slash $10B in costs\nAI boom is reshaping the face of cloud infrastructure\n\nA blueprint for competition\nAssuming NIMs see widespread adoption, they could quickly become a major growth driver for Nvidia.\nA little back of the napkin math tells us that if NIMs helped Nvidia attach an AI Enterprise to each of the two million some Hopper GPUs it's expected to ship in 2024, it'd be looking at another $9 to $17.5 billion in annual subscription revenues. Realistically, that's not going to happen \u2013 but even if it can realize a fraction of that we're still talking about billions of dollars in annual revenue.\nThat's not to say NIMs are without challenges. Compared to AI training, inferencing isn't particularly picky. There are several model runners that support inferencing across Nvidia, AMD, and even general-purpose CPUs. NIMs, by comparison, only run on Nvidia hardware \u2013 which could prove limiting for customers looking to leverage container orchestration systems like Kubernetes to deploy and serve their models at scale.\nThis probably won't be a big issue while Nvidia still controls the lion's share of the AI infrastructure market, but will no doubt be a big red flag for customers wary of vendor lock-in.\nIt might also grab the attention not only of shareholders, but also the Department of Justice. The DoJ is already said to be building an antitrust case against the GPU giant.\nThat said, if you just want to make models easier to deploy across various cloud and on-prem infrastructure, there's really nothing stopping anyone from creating their own NIM-equivalents, tuned to their preferred hardware or software of choice. In fact, it's surprising that more developers haven't done something like this already. We can easily imagine AMD and Intel bringing similar services to market \u2013 potentially even undercutting Nvidia by offering them at no cost.\nUltimately, the success of Nvidia's NIMs may depend on just how much more efficient or performant their tuning is, and how much easier they are to stitch together. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Gemini\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Google AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-3\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-4\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Large Language Model\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Machine Learning\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                MCubed\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Neural Networks\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NLP\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Star Wars\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Tensor Processing Unit\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                TOPS\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Self-driving Car\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nMore like these\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPU\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrower topics\n\n\n\n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Gemini\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Google AI\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-3\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GPT-4\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                GTC\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Large Language Model\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Machine Learning\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                MCubed\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Neural Networks\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                NLP\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Omniverse\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Star Wars\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Tensor Processing Unit\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                TOPS\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nBroader topics\n\n\n\n\n                Alder Lake\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Hardware\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                Self-driving Car\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNvidia won the AI training race, but inference is still anyone's game\n\nComment\u00a0When it's all abstracted by an API endpoint, do you even care what's behind the curtain?\n\nSystems12 Mar 2025 | 5\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCoreWeave rides AI wave with IPO filing \u2013 but its fate hinges on Microsoft\nGPU farm discloses 77% of revenue tied to just two customers, putting Redmond giant front and center\n\nAI + ML4 Mar 2025 | \n\n\n\n\n\n \nDespite Wall Street jitters, AI hopefuls keep spending billions on AI infrastructure\n\nComment\u00a0Sunk cost fallacy?

As the company prepares to report its second-quarter earnings this Wednesday, all eyes are on the chipmaker that has become synonymous with the generative AI boom.\nThe numbers tell a compelling story. Nvidia\u2019s stock has surged over 150% this year, adding $1.82 trillion to its market value. This growth stems from insatiable demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Meta are racing to secure supplies of the company\u2019s GPUs, particularly the coveted H100 chip. These processors have become essential for training large language models that power applications like ChatGPT.\u00a0\nThe Silicon Gold Rush\nNvidia\u2019s dominance in AI chips has allowed it to command premium prices. Some H100 chips reportedly fetch upwards of $40,000 on the open market. This pricing power is reflected in the company\u2019s financials, with adjusted gross margins reaching 79.1% in the first quarter.\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, in a news release. \u201cAI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.\u201d\nBut Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise hasn\u2019t been without turbulence. Nvidia stock experienced a 20% slump through July and early August, reflecting investor concerns about the company\u2019s ability to meet sky-high expectations. Questions linger about the sustainability of AI-related spending by major tech firms.\nPotential production delays of Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell AI chips add another layer of uncertainty. CEO Jensen Huang had indicated these chips would ship in the second quarter, but analysts have flagged design hurdles that could push back the timeline.\nNavigating Choppy Waters\nNvidia faces mounting regulatory scrutiny as well. U.S. regulators are probing whether the company has pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products or attempted to bundle its networking equipment with AI chips.\nCompetition in the AI chip market is intensifying. Long-time rival AMD is making strides with its own AI processors, while tech giants like Google and Amazon are developing custom silicon for their data centers. In China, where U.S. export restrictions limit Nvidia\u2019s reach, domestic champion Huawei is emerging as a formidable competitor.\nTo address the China market, Nvidia is reportedly developing a new line of AI processors specifically designed to comply with U.S. export regulations. These chips, rumored to be called H20, would be less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top-tier offerings but could help the company maintain a foothold in a crucial market.\nAs Wednesday\u2019s earnings report approaches, analysts expect Nvidia to forecast third-quarter revenue growth of 75% to $31.69 billion. This would mark the end of the company\u2019s five-quarter streak of triple-digit growth, a potential inflection point for investors.\nThe generative AI boom has reshaped the tech landscape, with Nvidia emerging as a key beneficiary. The company\u2019s chips have become essential infrastructure for the AI revolution, powering everything from chatbots and image generators to advanced healthcare, finance, and scientific research applications.\nCritics argue that the current hype around generative AI may be outpacing its practical applications and economic value. Others point to ethical concerns and potential job displacement as reasons for caution.\nFor Nvidia, the path forward involves navigating these complex dynamics while continuing to innovate. The company\u2019s performance in the coming quarters will be crucial in determining whether it can maintain its dominant position or if market realities will temper its growth.\nNvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report is a litmus test for the entire AI sector. The company\u2019s fortunes have become inextricably linked with the future of AI, its chips powering the algorithms that are reshaping our digital world. As investors and tech enthusiasts parse the numbers, Nvidia\u2019s ability to stay ahead of the curve will likely define its success in future years.\n\u00a0\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    The Digital Gold at the End of the Rainbow: How Tech Is Transforming St. Patrick\u2019s Day                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, AI Chips, artificial intelligence, generative AI, News, NVIDIA, PYMNTS News, regulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n                FlexTecs Updates FlexTrap Tool to Capture Payments Discrepancies            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However, Nvidia\u2019s earnings beat wasn\u2019t as eye-popping as in quarters past, which may explain why shares fell after hours.\n\nNvidia Revenue Up 122% on Last Year\nWe maintain our $105 per share fair value estimate. In the near term, we still assume that Nvidia will increase its data center, or DC, revenue by a few billion per quarter as additional GPU production capacity comes online. Yet our fair value estimate is mostly driven by our longer-term assumptions for AI adoption and robust DC spending by Nvidia\u2019s key AI customers. We maintain our Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating as both assumptions will be opaque and may shift in the years ahead.\nRevenue in the July quarter was $30 billion, up 15% sequentially, up 122% year over year, and ahead of guidance of $28 billion. DC revenue was $26.3 billion, up 154% year over year. Even with Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell products arriving later this year, the firm saw no slowdown in demand for its existing Hopper family of products. Nvidia expects to earn \u201cseveral billions\u201d of Blackwell revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter ending January 2025. In the meantime, management anticipates that Hopper shipments and revenue will still see growth in the second half of fiscal 2025, as customers won\u2019t pause their purchases of Hopper while waiting for Blackwell.\nNvidia expects October-quarter revenue to be $32.5 billion, which would be up 8% sequentially and 79% year over year. Nvidia\u2019s key AI customers still intend to invest heavily in AI capital expenditure, and we still expect Nvidia to reap most of the rewards of such spending.\nLooking Ahead to Nvidia\u2019s 2026\nIn the second half of fiscal 2025, and based on third-quarter guidance, we model another $3 billion of DC revenue growth to $29.4 billion in the third quarter. We estimate $4.4 billion of incremental DC revenue in the fourth quarter (ending January 2025) to $33.8 billion. This fourth-quarter forecast is above our prior estimates, as Nvidia will not only see Hopper growth, but will also layer Blackwell revenue on top of Hopper. As we look ahead to fiscal 2026 \u2014 which is effectively calendar 2025 \u2014 we still foresee incremental revenue growth, quarter by quarter, as more and more GPU supply comes online.\nWe still view Nvidia as the clear-cut leader in GPUs and related software (CUDA) used for AI training and don\u2019t believe the company has serious competition in AI training today. Yet we remain encouraged by management\u2019s position that 40% of its GPUs are being used for AI inference, which is a piece of the AI market that should be larger, and more competitive, than training over time.\nLooking at the makeup of DC revenue, sales into China grew sequentially and represented a \u201csignificant\u201d portion of DC revenue despite severe US regulations that restrict the company from selling anything close to its most powerful processors to Chinese AI customers. Still, Nvidia conceded that China\u2019s proportion of DC revenue remains far below prerestriction levels of 20% or so.\nNvidia also thinks that DC revenue from sovereign governments will exceed $10 billion this year, up from a prior estimate of \u201chigh single digit billions\u201d announced last quarter. We\u2019re encouraged by the higher outlook and tend to think that such revenue might be stickier in the long run as it won\u2019t hinge on a government\u2019s ability to generate AI revenue.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nAI\nINVESTMENTS\nMARKETS\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

Rivals have accused Wall Street darling Nvidia of abusing its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence \u2014 and the U.S. Justice Department is now investigating these complaints, technology news site The Information reported.According to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, Justice Department officials are looking into concerns Nvidia is potentially cornering the market and pressuring its customers to unfairly retain business. That includes allegations of Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant and its competitors.The Information also reported that U.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors about the complaints.The probe comes just weeks after the Justice Department made an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to split oversight of companies in the rapidly growing AI industry, with the Justice Department's antitrust division\u00a0overseeing chipmaker Nvidia.The Justice Department declined to comment or provide further information when reached by The Associated Press on Friday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House awards Samsung $6.4 billion to expand U.S. chipmaking\n05:20\n\n\n\nBut a statement from Nvidia said the company \"wins on merit\" \u2014 and competes \"based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws.\"\n\n\nWithout directly acknowledging details of The Information's Thursday report, the company added that it is \"happy to provide any information regulators need.\"Nvidia has faced calls for an antitrust investigation from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups before. Earlier this week, 10 progressive advocacy groups \u2014 including Demand Progress Education Fund and Tech Oversight Project \u2014 penned a letter to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in support of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker.\"Nvidia is the world's chip gatekeeper,\" the groups wrote, arguing the company had \"bullied its way into a prominent investment position\" by leveraging scarce supply alongside tactics like blocking customers from doing business with competitors. \"Such a company deserves the most aggressive scrutiny that the Department of Justice can bring to bear.\"Nvidia's has cemented itself as a poster child for the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 and in the process become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In June, the tech giant briefly reached a market value of more than $3.3 trillion.\n\n\nSome of that market momentum has stalled a little since \u2014 and any stock climbing to such heights is vulnerable to some investors selling shares to lock in profits. On Friday afternoon, shares for Nvidia were down 3%.\n\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How to invest in gold without paying today's high price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n China EV maker BYD says new cars can be charged in 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Received a low home equity loan appraisal?

But they\u2019re not a one-size-fits-all solution, and developers often must fine-tune LLMs to fit the needs of their applications.\nThe NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit makes it easy to fine-tune and deploy AI models on RTX AI PCs and workstations through a technique called low-rank adaptation, or LoRA. A new update, available today, enables support for using multiple LoRA adapters simultaneously within the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM AI acceleration library, improving the performance of fine-tuned models by up to 6x.\nFine-Tuned for Performance\nLLMs must be carefully customized to achieve higher performance and meet growing user demands.\nThese foundational models are trained on huge amounts of data but often lack the context needed for a developer\u2019s specific use case. For example, a generic LLM can generate video game dialogue, but it will likely miss the nuance and subtlety needed to write in the style of a woodland elf with a dark past and a barely concealed disdain for authority.\nTo achieve more tailored outputs, developers can fine-tune the model with information related to the app\u2019s use case.\nTake the example of developing an app to generate in-game dialogue using an LLM. The process of fine-tuning starts with using the weights of a pretrained model, such as information on what a character may say in the game. To get the dialogue in the right style, a developer can tune the model on a smaller dataset of examples, such as dialogue written in a more spooky or villainous tone.\nIn some cases, developers may want to run all of these different fine-tuning processes simultaneously. For example, they may want to generate marketing copy written in different voices for various content channels. At the same time, they may want to summarize a document and make stylistic suggestions \u2014 as well as draft a video game scene description and imagery prompt for a text-to-image generator.\nIt\u2019s not practical to run multiple models simultaneously, as they won\u2019t all fit in GPU memory at the same time. Even if they did, their inference time would be impacted by memory bandwidth \u2014 how fast data can be read from memory into GPUs.\nLo(RA) and Behold\nA popular way to address these issues is to use fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation. A simple way of thinking of it is as a patch file containing the customizations from the fine-tuning process.\nOnce trained, customized LoRA adapters can integrate seamlessly with the foundation model during inference, adding minimal overhead. Developers can attach the adapters to a single model to serve multiple use cases. This keeps the memory footprint low while still providing the additional details needed for each specific use case.\nArchitecture overview of supporting multiple clients and use-cases with a single foundation model using multi-LoRA capabilities\nIn practice, this means that an app can keep just one copy of the base model in memory, alongside many customizations using multiple LoRA adapters.\nThis process is called multi-LoRA serving. When multiple calls are made to the model, the GPU can process all of the calls in parallel, maximizing the use of its Tensor Cores and minimizing the demands of memory and bandwidth so developers can efficiently use AI models in their workflows. Fine-tuned models using multi-LoRA adapters perform up to 6x faster.\nLLM inference performance on GeForce RTX 4090 Desktop GPU for Llama 3B int4 with LoRA adapters applied at runtime. Input sequence length is 43 tokens and output sequence length is 100 tokens. LoRA adapter max rank is 64.\nIn the example of the in-game dialogue application described earlier, the app\u2019s scope could be expanded, using multi-LoRA serving, to generate both story elements and illustrations \u2014 driven by a single prompt.\nThe user could input a basic story idea, and the LLM would flesh out the concept, expanding on the idea to provide a detailed foundation. The application could then use the same model, enhanced with two distinct LoRA adapters, to refine the story and generate corresponding imagery. One LoRA adapter generates a Stable Diffusion prompt to create visuals using a locally deployed Stable Diffusion XL model. Meanwhile, the other LoRA adapter, fine-tuned for story writing, could craft a well-structured and engaging narrative.\nIn this case, the same model is used for both inference passes, ensuring that the space required for the process doesn\u2019t significantly increase. The second pass, which involves both text and image generation, is performed using batched inference, making the process exceptionally fast and efficient on NVIDIA GPUs. This allows users to rapidly iterate through different versions of their stories, refining the narrative and the illustrations with ease.\nThis process is outlined in more detail in a recent technical blog.\nLLMs are becoming one of the most important components of modern AI. As adoption and integration grows, demand for powerful, fast LLMs with application-specific customizations will only increase. The multi-LoRA support added today to the RTX AI Toolkit gives developers a powerful new way to accelerate these capabilities.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: AI Decoded | Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So she dove headfirst into an MBA program at the New York University Stern School of Business.\n\u201cSoftware engineering is about building the best product, while product management is about deciding what products to build to maximize user and business value,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cIt requires having knowledge in business and empathy for users \u2014 that\u2019s why I went back to school.\u201d\nAfter completing her first year at NYU Stern, she joined NVIDIA as an intern through the NVIDIA MBA program, which prepares the next generation of leaders to manage large teams while driving innovation and business strategy. The program also offers the opportunity for professionals like Zhang to pivot industries and pursue new career paths.\nAs a product management intern with NVIDIA\u2019s enterprise platforms team, Zhang works with data scientists and machine learning engineers to explore how NVIDIA RTX-powered AI workstations and NVIDIA NIM microservices can assist in their work and development processes.\n\nFor her summer research project, she gathered information from data scientists on their AI development journey with an end goal of integrating into their workflows AI workstations \u2014 powerful computers consisting of NVIDIA professional GPUs and enterprise-grade software.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the integration of hardware and software solutions as a valuable addition to data scientists,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cEvery part of their work can start with an AI workstation.\u201d\nShe recently presented her research at the MBA Intern Project Showcase, an internal event that highlights the work interns have accomplished.\n\n\u201cThis internship actually validated that I love being a product manager, and I want to continue doing that,\u201d said Zhang, emphasizing how much she enjoys the process of talking to end users, understanding their challenges and bringing solutions to enable their life\u2019s work.\nFor anyone considering a career in product management, Zhang recommends developing business acumen, technical skills and user empathy. She also encourages professionals in any industry to be open to learning and exploring new things, whether technologies or industries.\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, as a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, he\u2019s seeking ways to apply his technical knowledge to improve the accuracy and accessibility of such technology.\nIn 2021, Martin joined a research lab at his university focused on developing accessible technology for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\nHis lived experiences drove his research on advancing wearable systems, such as glasses with built-in live captioning capabilities. Another project involved applying AI to create educational games that make learning American Sign Language more accessible to hearing parents with deaf children.\nLooking to dive deeper into AI for social good, Martin found his way to NVIDIA, where his responsibilities include advising engineering teams that are working on sign language AI applications and supporting the development of ethical dataset curation tools.\n\n\u201cTo build accessible and trustworthy AI models, data collection efforts must be minimally invasive while achieving maximum benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe develop AI for humans to use, so we need to preserve trust in the system.\u201d\nMartin collaborates with various engineering teams to ensure the data they use is unbiased, transparent and secure. He\u2019s also training sign language recognition models and experimenting with features that could provide immediate benefits to the deaf community.\n\u201cI offer a voice for my community across the development process of new AI-driven systems that can power positive change,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to leading his own projects using trustworthy AI principles, Martin has connected with fellow interns through NVIDIA\u2019s University Recruiting program. This summer\u2019s interns \u2014 the first to return to office since the pandemic and comprising the company\u2019s largest intern class yet \u2014 participated in global events such as career development workshops, a research showcase and a Q&A with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nMartin appreciates NVIDIA\u2019s open culture, which encourages experimenting and connecting with leaders across the company \u2014 from legal to robotics. On his mission to improve tech accessibility, he\u2019s broadened his understanding of AI for good through insights from various NVIDIANs.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to talk with everyone, from executives to other interns, while exploring a variety of disciplines,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving exposure to a breadth of people and projects has been very helpful in developing skills that better my community.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Gavin Newsom)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia on Friday announced a new partnership with the tech giant Nvidia to provide students, educators and workers in the state\u2019s community colleges with access to generative artificial intelligence training and resources to learn new skills and advance their careers.\nThe partnership was formalized by a memorandum\u00a0of understanding signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Wednesday. The agreement aims to expand access to AI tools in community colleges.\nUnder the agreement, Nvidia will share its AI resources and training materials, such as curriculums, certifications, hardware, software, labs and workshops, with community colleges with the aim of bolstering innovation in the state.\nThe partnership builds on Newsom\u2019s 2023\u00a0executive order that required California to explore responsible ways to use generative AI by this summer. The order created an AI task force, which released its first\u00a0first report\u00a0last November detailing the benefits and risks posed by generative AI. \n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia is also conducting a six-month trial of generative AI tools inside state government, and has asked companies to propose generative AI tools that can help\u00a0reduce highway congestion. The state awarded its first AI contract for that project in June.\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s world-leading companies are pioneering AI breakthroughs, and it\u2019s essential that we create more opportunities for Californians to get the skills to utilize this technology and advance their careers,\u201d Newsom said in a news release. \u201cWe\u2019re teaming up with NVIDIA to connect AI tools directly to students, educators, and workers \u2013 creating a pipeline to drive the innovations of the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten by Keely Quinlan\n\t\t\tKeely Quinlan reports on privacy and digital government for StateScoop.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1% on the week. The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.  But the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday. Earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.

Market Open.   ^GSPC ^DJI ^IXIC   Advanced Chart    A done deal On Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September. But he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway. Powell noted the timing and pace of cuts will \"depend on incoming data,\" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has \"ample room\" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.  Read more: Fed predictions for 2024: What experts say about the possibility of a rate cut With only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts. \"We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],\" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients. As of early Monday morning, markets were pricing in a 36.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen a week before, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.   Capital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors. \"Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,\" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.\" While Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.   Story Continues Economists expect annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.Powell said on Friday his confidence has \"grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.\" All eyes on NvidiaWith nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.As has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.Wall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year, with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.The stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.08 -2.45 (-2.05%)  As of 3:04:20 PM EDT.

(I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty ImagesTech volatility could be 'behind us'Whipsaw movements in Nvidia and the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have been a feature of the market's recent drawdown and subsequent bounce back.Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance this week that the back-and-forth action could be primed to settle down.\"I think most of the short-term volatility in [the Magnificent Seven] stocks is behind us,\" Snider said.The rally in this group \u2014 which consists of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), along with Nvidia \u2014 between Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 added more than $1.4 trillion to their collective market cap.\"The trajectory of sales and earnings growth has been resilient, more resilient than a lot of investors feared coming into the second quarter,\" Snider added. \"Valuations are by no means low compared to history, but they're lower than they were several weeks ago, and we won't get another earnings report for a few months now.\" For the first time since the start of 2022, hedge funds trimmed exposure to many Magnificent Seven tech stocks to end the second quarter, according to Snider's recent analysis of securities filings for the end of the second quarter. Amazon and Apple were exceptions.Snider said this move \"speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.\"He added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed \"some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.\"\"In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,\" Snider said.Now, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. \"I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,\" Snider said.Nothing like price to change an investor's feelings.Weekly CalendarMondayEconomic data: Durable goods orders, July preliminary (+4.2% expected, -6.7% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, August (-16 expected, -17.5 previously)Earnings: Trip.com (TCOM)TuesdayEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, August (100.1 expected, 100.3 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.34% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, June (+6.81% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, August (-17 previously)Earnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Box (BOX), Nordstrom (JWN)WednesdayEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Aug. 23 (-10.1% prior)Earnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Affirm (AFRM), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Chewy (CHWY), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HPQ), Kohl's (KSS), Okta (OKTA), RBC (RBC), Salesforce (CRM), The J.M.

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched two separate probes into Nvidia regarding antitrust concerns about the computing giant\u2019s AI-focused business dealings. The first investigation, reported by Politico, will see the DOJ examine Nvidia\u2019s buyout of Run:ai, while the second, as reported by The Information, will assess if Nvidia abused its dominance in AI chips to discourage customers from using competing products.In April, Nvidia reportedly spent $700 million to acquire Run:ai, the Israeli startup specializing in GPU management software. While specific concerns surrounding the Run:ai purchase haven\u2019t been disclosed, both US and international regulators have closely scrutinized big tech acquisitions of late over issues like anticompetitive business practices and market monopolies. AI acquisitions have been of particular interest, with a joint statement issued by major US, EU, and UK regulators in July pledging to \u201csafeguard against tactics that would undermine fair competition or lead to unfair or deceptive practices in the AI ecosystem.\u201dRelatedThis is Big Tech\u2019s playbook for swallowing the AI industryAI Chip race: Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Nvidia battle it outThe second investigation being launched by the DOJ comes in response to complaints from competitors. It will examine whether Nvidia abused its market dominance to pressure cloud providers into buying its products. The probe will also investigate claims that Nvidia overcharges its customers for networking equipment if they opt to purchase AI chips from rival companies like AMD and Intel.\u201cWe compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making Nvidia openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d Nvidia spokesperson Mylene Mangalindan said in a statement to Politico. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to support aspiring innovators in every industry and market and are happy to provide any information regulators need.\u201dNvidia is estimated to control between 70 percent and 95 percent of the market for chips needed to train AI models. Nvidia\u2019s dominance has drawn ire from other global regulators, with Reuters reporting last month that the company may face French antitrust charges for alleged anti-competitive practices. In June, Nvidia briefly overtook Microsoft as the world\u2019s most valuable company, a feat largely propelled by booming demand for AI technology.See More: AINewsNvidiaPolicyPoliticsRegulationTechMost PopularMost PopularAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsLeaked Apple meeting shows how dire the Siri situation really isThe OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

We still believe the firm is supply-constrained, and that its revenue is somewhat capped by the production availability of key manufacturers and partners.\nThe best indicator of Nvidia's AI GPU growth will be hyperscaler capex spending, and we received good news in late July. Microsoft (MSFT)\u00a0still expects to have even higher capex in the next 12 months than what it just reported, and Meta Platforms (META)\u00a0lifted the midpoint of its capex guidance to $38.5 billion from $37.5 billion. Amazon (AMZN)\u00a0also expects to spend more on AI next year.\nAt the same time, both Alphabet (GOOGL)\u00a0and Meta have conceded that it is far riskier to underinvest in AI than overinvest. This may bode well for Nvidia in the near term, but it increases the risk that there will be a crash in investment at some point once they secure adequate AI GPU supply.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\u00a0boosted its AI GPU guidance for 2024, albeit at far lower levels than what Nvidia is selling. Still, we think this is likely a good sign. Even if customers choose AMD because of availability, it means demand for Nvidia's GPUs must still be strong.\nAI revenue is coming more into focus, as investors are rightfully questioning whether companies will generate enough to justify existing AI spending. We think these questions miss a portion of the AI investment\u00a0\u2013 namely, R&D by startups, enterprises, and \"moonshot\" projects (robotics, genetics, autonomous driving), where we anticipate a good deal of investment, even if no explicit AI revenue is attached to it.\nStill, investors are right to consider how and when these investments will pay off. In the best case, firms investing in AI will see significant revenue growth from it. However, we might see a host of firms that don't generate tons of AI revenue, but will at least protect their businesses from upstarts, while firms that fail to invest in AI become antiquated. In these latter cases, the high AI capex and R&D are still reasonable, even if the payoff is implicit rather than explicit.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\n\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $105.00\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating: 3 stars\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High\n\nMorningstar Fair Value Estimate for Nvidia\nWith its 3-star rating, we believe Nvidia's stock is fairly valued compared to our long-term fair value estimate of $105 per share, which implies an equity value of roughly $2.5 trillion. Our fair value estimate implies a fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025, or effectively calendar 2024) price/adjusted earnings multiple of 37 times and a fiscal 2026 forward price/adjusted earnings multiple of 27 times.\nOur fair value estimate, and Nvidia's stock price, will be driven by its prospects in the data center and AI GPUs, for better or worse. Nvidia's DC business has achieved exponential growth already, rising from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in fiscal 2023 and more than tripling thereafter to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024. DC revenue appears to be supply-constrained, and we think that Nvidia will continue to steadily boost revenue in each of the four quarters in fiscal 2025 as more supply comes online. Based on Nvidia's strong forecast start for fiscal 2025, we model DC revenue rising 133% to $111 billion in fiscal 2025. We model a 23% compound annual growth rate for the three years thereafter, as we anticipate strong growth in capital expenditures in data centers at leading enterprise and cloud computing customers. We think it is reasonable that Nvidia may face an inventory correction or a pause in AI demand at some point in the medium term thereafter. Excluding this one-year blip that we model, we anticipate average annual DC growth of 10% thereafter and consider this to be a reasonable long-term growth rate as AI matures.\nRead more about Nvidia's fair value estimate\n\nMorningstar Economic Moat Rating For Nvidia\nWe assign Nvidia a wide moat, thanks to intangible assets around its graphics processing units and, increasingly, switching costs around its proprietary software, such as its Cuda platform for AI tools, which lets developers use the firm's GPUs to build AI models.\nNvidia was an early leader and designer of GPUs, originally developed to offload graphic processing tasks on PCs and gaming consoles. The firm has emerged as the clear market share leader in discrete GPUs (over 80% share, per Mercury Research). We attribute this leadership to intangible assets associated with GPU design, as well as the associated software, frameworks, and tools developers need to work with these GPUs. In our view, recent introductions like ray-tracing technology and the use of AI tensor cores in gaming applications are signs Nvidia has not lost its GPU leadership. A quick scan of GPU pricing in gaming and DC shows the firm's average selling prices can often be twice as high as its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices.\nRead more about Nvidia's economic moat\nNvidia's Financial Strength\nNvidia is in outstanding financial health. As of April 2024, the company held $31.4 billion in cash and investments, as compared with $9.7 billion in short-term and long-term debt. Semiconductor firms tend to hold large cash balances to help them navigate the cycles of the chip industry. During downturns, this provides them with a cushion and flexibility to continue investing in research and development, which is necessary to maintain their competitive and technology positions. Nvidia's dividend is virtually immaterial relative to its financial health and forward prospects, and most of the firm's distribution to shareholders comes in the form of stock buybacks.\nRead more about Nvidia's financial strength\nRisk and Uncertainty for Nvidia Shares\nWe assign Nvidia a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Very High. The firm is an industry leader in GPUs used in training AI models, and it has carved out a good portion of demand for chips used in AI inference workloads (which involves running a model to make a prediction or output).\nWe see many tech leaders vying for Nvidia's leading AI position. We think it is inevitable that leading hyper-scale vendors will seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia and diversify their semiconductor and software supplier base, including by developing in-house solutions. Among existing semiconductor vendors, AMD is quickly expanding its GPU lineup to serve these cloud leaders. Intel also has AI accelerator products today and will likely remain focused on this opportunity.\nRead more about Nvidia's risk and uncertainty\nNVDA Bulls Say\nNvidia's GPUs offer industry-leading parallel processing, which was historically needed in PC gaming applications, but has expanded into crypto mining, AI, and perhaps future applications, too.\nNvidia's data center GPUs and Cuda software platform have established the company as the dominant vendor for AI model training, which is a use case that should rise exponentially in the years ahead.\nThe firm has a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving market that could lead to widespread adoption of its Drive PX self-driving platform.\nNVDA Bears Say\nNvidia is a leading AI chip vendor today, but other powerful chipmakers and tech titans are focused on in-house chip development.\nAlthough Cuda is currently a leader in AI training software and tools, leading cloud vendors would likely prefer to see greater competition in this space, and they may shift to any alternative open-source tools that arise.\nNvidia's gaming GPU business has often seen boom-or-bust cycles based on PC demand and, more recently, cryptocurrency mining.\nThis article was compiled by Leona Murray\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletters\nSign up Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nEQUITY RESEARCH\nNVIDIA\nUS EQUITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nAimed at making hit identification \u2014 the process of finding promising drug candidates \u2014 faster and smarter, NVIDIA on Wednesday released the NVIDIA Blueprint for generative AI-based virtual screening.\nThis software-based approach will reduce the time and cost of hit discovery and lead optimization, leading to streamlined development of life-saving drugs and enabling quicker access to critical treatments for patients.\nThis NVIDIA Blueprint introduces a paradigm shift in the drug discovery process, particularly in the crucial \u201chit-to-lead\u201d transition, by moving from traditional fixed database screening to generative AI-driven molecule design and pre-optimization, enabling researchers to design better molecules faster.\nWhat\u2019s a NIM? What\u2019s an NVIDIA Blueprint?\nNVIDIA NIM microservices are modular, cloud-native components that accelerate AI model deployment and execution. These microservices allow drug discovery researchers to integrate and scale advanced AI models within their workflows, enabling faster and more efficient processing of complex data.\nThe generative virtual screening NVIDIA Blueprint, a comprehensive guide, shows how these microservices can optimize key stages of drug discovery, such as hit identification and lead optimization.\nHow Is Generative AI Used for Virtual Screening?\nDrug discovery is a complex process with three critical stages: target identification, hit identification and lead optimization. Target identification involves choosing the right protein receptor or other biological target to modify to treat the disease; hit identification is identifying potential molecules that will bind to that target; and lead optimization is improving the design of those molecules to be safer and more effective.\nThis NVIDIA Blueprint, called generative virtual screening for accelerated drug discovery, identifies and improves virtual hits in a smarter and more efficient way.\nAt its core are three essential AI models, now including the recently integrated AlphaFold2 as part of NVIDIA\u2019s NIM microservices.\n\nAlphaFold2, as an NVIDIA NIM, enables researchers to more quickly and accurately predict protein structures. Packaged as an NVIDIA NIM, AlphaFold2 can be deployed in any computing environment, saving researchers hours or more in setup and deployment time.\nMolMIM is a novel model developed by NVIDIA that generates molecules while simultaneously optimizing for multiple properties, such as high solubility and low toxicity. Capable of accepting custom input from other models, MolMIM helps researchers design promising candidates with improved pharmacological profiles faster and in fewer steps.\nDiffDock is an advanced molecular docking tool for quickly modeling the binding of small molecules to their protein targets, helping researchers accelerate the identification of effective compounds.\n\nThese models work in concert to improve the hit-to-lead process, making it more efficient and faster.\nEach of these AI models is packaged within NVIDIA NIM microservices \u2014 portable containers designed to accelerate the performance, shorten time-to-market and simplify the deployment of generative AI models anywhere.\nThe NVIDIA Blueprint integrates these microservices into a flexible, scalable, generative AI workflow that can help transform drug discovery.\nLeading computational drug discovery and biotechnology software providers that are using NIM microservices now, such as Benchling, Dotmatics, Terray, TetraScience and Cadence Molecular Sciences (OpenEye), are using NVIDIA Blueprints in their computer-aided drug discovery platforms.\nThese integrations aim to make the hit-to-lead process faster and more intelligent, leading to the identification of more viable drug candidates in less time and at lower cost.\nGlobal professional services company Accenture is poised to tailor the NVIDIA Blueprint to the specific needs of drug development programs by optimizing the molecule generation step with input from pharmaceutical partners to inform the MolMIM NIM.\nIn addition, the NIM microservices that comprise the NVIDIA Blueprint will soon be available on AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service that helps customers orchestrate biological analyses. This includes streamlining the integration of AI into existing drug discovery workflows.\nRevolutionizing Drug Development With AI\nThe stakes in drug discovery are high.\nDeveloping a new drug typically costs around $2.6 billion and can take 10-15 years, with a success rate of less than 10%.\nBy making molecular design and lead optimization smarter with NVIDIA\u2019s AI-powered AI Blueprint, pharmaceutical companies can reduce these costs and shorten development timelines in the $1.5 trillion global pharmaceutical market.\nThis NVIDIA AI Blueprint represents a significant shift from traditional drug discovery methods, offering a generative AI approach that pre-optimizes molecules for desired therapeutic properties.\nFor example, MolMIM, the generative model for molecules within this NVIDIA AI Blueprint, uses advanced functions to steer the generation of molecules with optimized pharmacokinetic properties \u2014 such as absorption rate, protein binding, half-life and other properties \u2014 a marked advancement over previous methods.\nThis smarter approach to small molecule design enhances the potential for successful lead optimization, accelerating the overall drug discovery process.\nThis leap in technology could lead to faster, more targeted treatments, addressing growing challenges in healthcare, from rising costs to an aging population.\nNVIDIA\u2019s commitment to supporting researchers with the latest advancements in accelerated computing underscores its role in solving the most complex problems in drug discovery.\nVisit build.nvidia.com to download the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for generative AI-based virtual screening and take the first step toward faster, more efficient drug development.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It helps companies train generative AI models on their own licensed data using NVIDIA Edify, a multimodal AI architecture that can use simple text prompts to generate images, videos, 3D assets, 360-degree high-dynamic-range imaging and physically based rendering (PBR) materials. Using AI Foundry, companies can train bespoke AI models to generate any of these assets.\n\nKey elements of Edify include its ability to generate multiple types of content, its superior training efficiency, which allows it to produce high-quality content while trained on fewer images, and its ability to fine-tune models to style-match or learn characters or objects.\n\nOne of the best examples of services built on NVIDIA AI Foundry and Edify is Generative AI by Getty Images, a commercially safe generative photography service. The combination of AI Foundry and Edify allows users to control their training datasets, so they can create models that fit their need.\nTo avoid copyright issues, Getty Images used Edify to train the service on its own licensed content, ensuring that no famous characters or products are in the dataset. The company also shares part of the profits with the contributors, driving a new revenue stream for creators who contribute to the model.\nAsset Generation With Edify\u00a0\nEdify can be trained to generate a variety of image types, including images, 3D assets and 360-degree HDRi environment maps.\nEdify Image can generate four high-quality 1K images in around six seconds, doubling the performance of the previous model. Images can also be converted to 4K with a generative upscaler that adds additional details.\nGetty Images 4K image generation trained on NVIDIA Edify using commercially safe creative libraries.\nImages are highly controllable thanks to advanced prompt adherence, camera controls to specify focal length or depth of field, and ControlNets to guide the generation. The ControlNets include Sketch, which allows users to provide a sketch to follow or copy the composition of an image, and Depth, to copy the composition of an image.\nImages can also be edited with Edify Image. InPaint allows users to add or modify content in an image. Replace \u2014 a strict InPaint \u2014 can change details such as clothing. And OutPaint can expand an image to match different aspect ratios. And all of this is simplified with Segment, a feature that can mask objects with just a text prompt.\nEdify can also create artist-ready 3D meshes. The meshes come with clean quads-based topology, up to 4K PBR materials and automatic UV mapping for easier texture editing. A fast preview mode provides results in as few as 10 seconds, which can then be turned into a full 3D mesh.\nMeshes are perfect for prototyping scenes, generating background objects for set decoration or as a head start for 3D sculpting.\nEdify 360 HDRi generates environment maps of natural landscapes that can be used to light a scene, for reflections and even as a background. The model can generate up to 16K HDRi images from text or image prompts. With a desired backplate in hand, users can create a custom HDRi to match instead of spending hours looking for one.\nHigh dynamic range, 360-degree panoramas from text prompts.\nEdify\u2019s multimodal capability is unique, enabling advanced workflows that combine different asset types. Used together with an agent, for instance, Edify allows users to prototype a full scene in a couple of minutes with a simple text prompt \u2014 like in the NVIDIA Research SIGGRAPH demo that showcased the assistive 3D world-building capabilities of NVIDIA Edify-powered models and the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.\n\nAnother use case is to combine Edify 3D and 360 HDRi with Image to give users full control of image generation. By generating the scene in 3D, artists can move objects around and frame their desired shot \u2014 and then use Edify Image to turn the prototype into a photorealistic image.\n\nGenerative AI by Getty Images\u00a0\nGetty Images is one of the largest content service providers and suppliers of creative visuals, editorial photography, video and music \u2014 and is the one of the first places people turn to discover, purchase and share powerful visual content from the world\u2019s best photographers and videographers.\nGetty Images used NVIDIA AI Foundry to train an NVIDIA Edify Image model to power its generative AI service. Available through Generative AI by Getty Images for enterprises and Generative AI by iStock for small businesses and amateur creators, the service allows users to generate and modify images using models powered by NVIDIA Edify.\nGenerative AI by Getty Images (or iStock) offers a variety of licensed content.\nGetty Images and iStock recently updated to the latest version of Edify Image, enabling faster generations and higher prompt adherence and exposing Camera Controls.\nUpdated camera controls in Generative AI by Getty Images.\nUsers can now also use the generative AI tools on preshot creative content, allowing them to edit and modify iStock\u2019s library of visuals to rapidly iterate and perfect content. Those same capabilities will be soon available on Gettyimages.com.\nTest drive Generative AI by Getty Images on ai.nvidia.com.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

They include:\n\nLLM applications: NeMo Curator, to create custom datasets, adds image curation and Nemotron-4 340B for high-quality synthetic data generation\nData processing: cuVS for vector search to build indexes in minutes instead of days and a new Polars GPU Engine in open beta\nPhysical AI: For physics simulation, Warp accelerates computations with a new TIle API. For wireless network simulation, Aerial adds more map formats for ray tracing and simulation. And for link-level wireless simulation, Sionna adds a new toolchain for real-time inference\n\nCompanies around the world are increasingly turning to NVIDIA accelerated computing to speed up applications they first ran on CPUs only. This has enabled them to achieve extreme speedups and benefit from incredible energy savings.\nIn Houston, CPFD makes computational fluid dynamics simulation software for industrial applications, like its Barracuda Virtual Reactor software that helps design next-generation recycling facilities. Plastic recycling facilities run CPFD software in cloud instances powered by NVIDIA accelerated computing. With a CUDA GPU-accelerated virtual machine, they can efficiently scale and run simulations 400x faster and 140x more energy efficiently than using a CPU-based workstation.\nBottles being loaded into a plastics recycling facility. AI-generated image.\nA popular video conferencing application captions several hundred thousand virtual meetings an hour. When using CPUs to create live captions, the app could query a transformer-powered speech recognition AI model three times a second. After migrating to GPUs in the cloud, the application\u2019s throughput increased to 200 queries per second \u2014 a 66x speedup and 25x energy-efficiency improvement.\nIn homes across the globe, an e-commerce website connects hundreds of millions of shoppers a day to the products they need using an advanced recommendation system powered by a deep learning model, running on its NVIDIA accelerated cloud computing system. After switching from CPUs to GPUs in the cloud, it achieved significantly lower latency with a 33x speedup and nearly 12x energy-efficiency improvement.\nWith the exponential growth of data, accelerated computing in the cloud is set to enable even more innovative use cases.\nNVIDIA Accelerated Computing on CUDA GPUs Is Sustainable Computing\nNVIDIA estimates that if all AI, HPC and data analytics workloads that are still running on CPU servers were CUDA GPU-accelerated, data centers would save 40 terawatt-hours of energy annually. That\u2019s the equivalent energy consumption of 5 million U.S. homes per year.\nAccelerated computing uses the parallel processing capabilities of CUDA GPUs to complete jobs orders of magnitude faster than CPUs, improving productivity while dramatically reducing cost and energy consumption.\nAlthough adding GPUs to a CPU-only server increases peak power, GPU acceleration finishes tasks quickly and then enters a low-power state. The total energy consumed with GPU-accelerated computing is significantly lower than with general-purpose CPUs, while yielding superior performance.\nGPUs achieve 20x greater energy efficiency compared to traditional computing on CPU-only servers because they deliver greater performance per watt, completing more tasks in less time.\nIn the past decade, NVIDIA AI computing has achieved approximately 100,000x more energy efficiency when processing large language models. To put that into perspective, if the efficiency of cars improved as much as NVIDIA has advanced the efficiency of AI on its accelerated computing platform, they\u2019d get 500,000 miles per gallon. That\u2019s enough to drive to the moon, and back, on less than a gallon of gasoline.\nIn addition to these dramatic boosts in efficiency on AI workloads, GPU computing can achieve incredible speedups over CPUs. Customers of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform running workloads on cloud service providers saw speedups of 10-180x across a gamut of real-world tasks, from data processing to computer vision, as the chart below shows.\nSpeedups of 10-180x achieved in real-world implementations by cloud customers across workloads with the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform.\nAs workloads continue to demand exponentially more computing power, CPUs have struggled to provide the necessary performance, creating a growing performance gap and driving \u201ccompute inflation.\u201d The chart below illustrates a multiyear trend of how data growth has far outpaced the growth in compute performance per watt of CPUs.\nThe widening gap between data growth and the lagging compute performance per watt of CPUs.\nThe energy savings of GPU acceleration frees up what would otherwise have been wasted cost and energy.\nWith its massive energy-efficiency savings, accelerated computing is sustainable computing.\nThe Right Tools for Every Job\u00a0\nGPUs cannot accelerate software written for general-purpose CPUs. Specialized algorithm software libraries are needed to accelerate specific workloads. Just like a mechanic would have an entire toolbox from a screwdriver to a wrench for different tasks, NVIDIA provides a diverse set of libraries to perform low-level functions like parsing and executing calculations on data.\nEach NVIDIA CUDA library is optimized to harness hardware features specific to NVIDIA GPUs. Combined, they encompass the power of the NVIDIA platform.\nNew updates continue to be added on the CUDA platform roadmap, expanding across diverse use cases:\nLLM Applications\nNeMo Curator gives developers the flexibility to quickly create custom datasets in large language model (LLM) use cases. Recently, we announced capabilities beyond text to expand to multimodal support, including image curation.\nSDG (synthetic data generation) augments existing datasets with high-quality, synthetically generated data to customize and fine-tune models and LLM applications. We announced Nemotron-4 340B, a new suite of models specifically built for SDG that enables businesses and developers to use model outputs and build custom models.\nData Processing Applications\ncuVS is an open-source library for GPU-accelerated vector search and clustering that delivers incredible speed and efficiency across LLMs and semantic search. The latest cuVS allows large indexes to be built in minutes instead of hours or even days, and searches them at scale.\nPolars is an open-source library that makes use of query optimizations and other techniques to process hundreds of millions of rows of data efficiently on a single machine. A new Polars GPU engine powered by NVIDIA\u2019s cuDF library will be available in open beta. It delivers up to a 10x performance boost compared to CPU, bringing the energy savings of accelerated computing to data practitioners and their applications.\nPhysical AI\nWarp, for high-performance GPU simulation and graphics, helps accelerate spatial computing by making it easier to write differentiable programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics and geometry processing. The next release will have support for a new Tile API that allows developers to use Tensor Cores inside GPUs for matrix and Fourier computations.\nAerial is a suite of accelerated computing platforms that includes Aerial CUDA-Accelerated RAN and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin for designing, simulating and operating wireless networks for commercial applications and industry research. The next release will include a new expansion of Aerial with more map formats for ray tracing and simulations with higher accuracy.\nSionna is a GPU-accelerated open-source library for link-level simulations of wireless and optical communication systems. With GPUs, Sionna achieves orders-of-magnitude faster simulation, enabling interactive exploration of these systems and paving the way for next-generation physical layer research. The next release will include the entire toolchain required to design, train and evaluate neural network-based receivers, including support for real-time inference of such neural receivers using NVIDIA TensorRT.\nNVIDIA provides over 400 libraries. Some, like CV-CUDA, excel at pre- and post-processing of computer vision tasks common in user-generated video, recommender systems, mapping and video conferencing. Others, like cuDF, accelerate data frames and tables central to SQL databases and pandas in data science.\nCAD \u2013 Computer-Aided Design, CAE \u2013 Computer-Aided Engineering, EDA \u2013 Electronic Design Automation\nMany of these libraries are versatile \u2014 for example, cuBLAS for linear algebra acceleration \u2014 and can be used across multiple workloads, while others are highly specialized to focus on a specific use case, like cuLitho for silicon computational lithography.\nFor researchers who don\u2019t want to build their own pipelines with NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries, NVIDIA NIM provides a streamlined path to production deployment by packaging multiple libraries and AI models into optimized containers. The containerized microservices deliver improved throughput out of the box.\nAugmenting these libraries\u2019 performance are an expanding number of hardware-based acceleration features that deliver speedups with the highest energy efficiencies. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform, for example, includes a decompression engine that unpacks compressed data files inline up to 18x faster than CPUs. This dramatically accelerates data processing applications that need to frequently access compressed files in storage like SQL, Apache Spark and pandas, and decompress them for runtime computation.\nThe integration of NVIDIA\u2019s specialized CUDA GPU-accelerated libraries into cloud computing platforms delivers remarkable speed and energy efficiency across a wide range of workloads. This combination drives significant cost savings for businesses and plays a crucial role in advancing sustainable computing, helping billions of users relying on cloud-based workloads to benefit from a more sustainable and cost-effective digital ecosystem.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s sustainable computing efforts and check out the Energy Efficiency Calculator to discover potential energy and emissions savings.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: CUDA | NVIDIA NeMo | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Step into the shoes of Indiana Jones and embark on a single-player, narrative-driven journey that spans the globe during the height of the legendary archaeologist\u2019s career.\nOn PC, make your adventures even more cinematic and immersive thanks to the inclusion of full ray tracing, which can be accelerated and further enhanced by NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction. From the hallowed halls of the Vatican and the sunken temples of Sukhothai to the pyramids of Egypt and the snowy peaks of the Himalayas, you\u2019ll experience Indy\u2019s adventure at top quality on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing, also known as path tracing, accurately simulates light throughout an entire scene. It is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality. However, until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, full ray tracing in real-time video games was impossible.\nAs demonstrated by full ray tracing in other top titles, image quality, realism and immersion are a priority, and in the case of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle you\u2019ll have an authentic Indiana Jones experience on your GeForce RTX PC or laptop.\u00a0\nTo take full ray tracing to the next level, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction will further enhance ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\nTrained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, using offline-rendered images that require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling. The results are superior to using hand-tuned denoisers, delivering higher fidelity ray-traced effects.\nWorking in tandem with DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Ray Reconstruction maximizes image quality and performance across all GeForce RTX GPUs, delivering the absolute best experience in ray-traced games.\nAdditionally, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. System latency affects the time it takes for actions to occur in-game - the lower your latency, the more responsive a game becomes, and the better the gameplay feels. Available in over 100 games, Reflex is used by over 50 million users each month, and with there being no downsides to the tech whatsoever, it\u2019s a must-have for gamers wanting the most responsive experience possible.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still enjoy Indiana Jones and The Great Circle by streaming it from the cloud with NVIDIA GeForce NOW. Ultimate members can play with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3 and Reflex, even on low-end devices. Members can stream over 1,900 of the real and full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com. Head over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin A GPU & Indiana Jones and the Great Circle\u2122 Backplate\nTo celebrate our technical partnership with Machine Games and Bethesda Softworks, we're giving away a GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition graphics card with a custom Indiana Jones and the Great Circle backplate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a chance to win, head to the GeForce Facebook, Instagram or X pages on August 21st, follow the prompt, ensuring you include #GeForceSummer is included in your message.

It comprises multiple NVIDIA chips, including the Blackwell GPU, Grace CPU, BlueField data processing unit, ConnectX network interface card, NVLink Switch, Spectrum Ethernet switch and Quantum InfiniBand switch.\n\nAjay Tirumala and Raymond Wong, directors of architecture at NVIDIA, will provide a first look at the platform and explain how these technologies work together to deliver a new standard for AI and accelerated computing performance while advancing energy efficiency.\nThe multi-node NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 solution is a perfect example. LLM inference requires low-latency, high-throughput token generation. GB200 NVL72 acts as a unified system to deliver up to 30x faster inference for LLM workloads, unlocking the ability to run trillion-parameter models in real time.\nTirumala and Wong will also discuss how the NVIDIA Quasar Quantization System \u2014 which brings together algorithmic innovations, NVIDIA software libraries and tools, and Blackwell\u2019s second-generation Transformer Engine \u2014 supports high accuracy on low-precision models, highlighting examples using LLMs and visual generative AI.\nKeeping Data Centers Cool\nThe traditional hum of air-cooled data centers may become a relic of the past as researchers develop more efficient and sustainable solutions that use hybrid cooling, a combination of air and liquid cooling.\nLiquid-cooling techniques move heat away from systems more efficiently than air, making it easier for computing systems to stay cool even while processing large workloads. The equipment for liquid cooling also takes up less space and consumes less power than air-cooling systems, allowing data centers to add more server racks \u2014 and therefore more compute power \u2014 in their facilities.\nAli Heydari, director of data center cooling and infrastructure at NVIDIA, will present several designs for hybrid-cooled data centers.\nSome designs retrofit existing air-cooled data centers with liquid-cooling units, offering a quick and easy solution to add liquid-cooling capabilities to existing racks. Other designs require the installation of piping for direct-to-chip liquid cooling using cooling distribution units or by entirely submerging servers in immersion cooling tanks. Although these options demand a larger upfront investment, they lead to substantial savings in both energy consumption and operational costs.\nHeydari will also share his team\u2019s work as part of COOLERCHIPS, a U.S. Department of Energy program to develop advanced data center cooling technologies. As part of the project, the team is using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform to create physics-informed digital twins that will help them model energy consumption and cooling efficiency to optimize their data center designs.\n\nAI Agents Chip In for Processor Design\nSemiconductor design is a mammoth challenge at microscopic scale. Engineers developing cutting-edge processors work to fit as much computing power as they can onto a piece of silicon a few inches across, testing the limits of what\u2019s physically possible.\nAI models are supporting their work by improving design quality and productivity, boosting the efficiency of manual processes and automating some time-consuming tasks. The models include prediction and optimization tools to help engineers rapidly analyze and improve designs, as well as LLMs that can assist engineers with answering questions, generating code, debugging design problems and more.\nMark Ren, director of design automation research at NVIDIA, will provide an overview of these models and their uses in a tutorial. In a second session, he\u2019ll focus on agent-based AI systems for chip design.\nAI agents powered by LLMs can be directed to complete tasks autonomously, unlocking broad applications across industries. In microprocessor design, NVIDIA researchers are developing agent-based systems that can reason and take action using customized circuit design tools, interact with experienced designers, and learn from a database of human and agent experiences.\nNVIDIA experts aren\u2019t just building this technology \u2014 they\u2019re using it. Ren will share examples of how engineers can use AI agents for timing report analysis, cell cluster optimization processes and code generation. The cell cluster optimization work recently won best paper at the first IEEE International Workshop on LLM-Aided Design.\nRegister for Hot Chips, taking place Aug. 25-27, at Stanford University and online.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | Generative AI | Hardware | NetworkingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | High-Performance Computing | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA Research | NVLink | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Training large language models is one challenge, but delivering LLM-powered real-time services is another.\nIn the latest round of MLPerf industry benchmarks, Inference v4.1, NVIDIA platforms delivered leading performance across all data center tests. The first-ever submission of the upcoming NVIDIA Blackwell platform revealed up to 4x more performance than the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU on MLPerf\u2019s biggest LLM workload, Llama 2 70B, thanks to its use of a second-generation Transformer Engine and FP4 Tensor Cores.\nThe NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU delivered outstanding results on every benchmark in the data center category \u2014 including the latest addition to the benchmark, the Mixtral 8x7B mixture of experts (MoE) LLM, which features a total of 46.7 billion parameters, with 12.9 billion parameters active per token.\nMoE models have gained popularity as a way to bring more versatility to LLM deployments, as they\u2019re capable of answering a wide variety of questions and performing more diverse tasks in a single deployment. They\u2019re also more efficient since they only activate a few experts per inference \u2014 meaning they deliver results much faster than dense models of a similar size.\nThe continued growth of LLMs is driving the need for more compute to process inference requests. To meet real-time latency requirements for serving today\u2019s LLMs, and to do so for as many users as possible, multi-GPU compute is a must. NVIDIA NVLink and NVSwitch provide high-bandwidth communication between GPUs based on the NVIDIA Hopper architecture and provide significant benefits for real-time, cost-effective large model inference. The Blackwell platform will further extend NVLink Switch\u2019s capabilities with larger NVLink domains with 72 GPUs.\nIn addition to the NVIDIA submissions, 10 NVIDIA partners \u2014 ASUSTek, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, Giga Computing, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Juniper Networks, Lenovo, Quanta Cloud Technology and Supermicro \u2014 all made solid MLPerf Inference submissions, underscoring the wide availability of NVIDIA platforms.\nRelentless Software Innovation\nNVIDIA platforms undergo continuous software development, racking up performance and feature improvements on a monthly basis.\nIn the latest inference round, NVIDIA offerings, including the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, NVIDIA Jetson platform and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, saw leaps and bounds in performance gains.\nThe NVIDIA H200 GPU delivered up to 27% more generative AI inference performance over the previous round, underscoring the added value customers get over time from their investment in the NVIDIA platform.\nTriton Inference Server, part of the NVIDIA AI platform and available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, is a fully featured open-source inference server that helps organizations consolidate framework-specific inference servers into a single, unified platform. This helps lower the total cost of ownership of serving AI models in production and cuts model deployment times from months to minutes.\nIn this round of MLPerf, Triton Inference Server delivered near-equal performance to NVIDIA\u2019s bare-metal submissions, showing that organizations no longer have to choose between using a feature-rich production-grade AI inference server and achieving peak throughput performance.\nGoing to the Edge\nDeployed at the edge, generative AI models can transform sensor data, such as images and videos, into real-time, actionable insights with strong contextual awareness. The NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics is uniquely capable of running any kind of model locally, including LLMs, vision transformers and Stable Diffusion.\nIn this round of MLPerf benchmarks, NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin system-on-modules achieved more than a 6.2x throughput improvement and 2.4x latency improvement over the previous round on the GPT-J\u00a0 LLM workload. Rather than developing for a specific use case, developers can now use this general-purpose 6-billion-parameter model to seamlessly interface with human language, transforming generative AI at the edge.\nPerformance Leadership All Around\nThis round of MLPerf Inference showed the versatility and leading performance of NVIDIA platforms \u2014 extending from the data center to the edge \u2014 on all of the benchmark\u2019s workloads, supercharging the most innovative AI-powered applications and services. To learn more about these results, see our technical blog.\nH200 GPU-powered systems are available today from CoreWeave \u2014 the first cloud service provider to announce general availability \u2014 and server makers ASUS, Dell Technologies, HPE, QCT and Supermicro.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Hardware | Networking | SoftwareTags: Inference | Jetson | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA Triton | NVLink \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company has accelerated its development timeline using NVIDIA Isaac Sim \u2014 a reference application built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform \u2014 to design, train and test AI-based robots using synthetic data, as well as NVIDIA GPUs to train generative AI models.\n\u201cOur rapid progress, marked by advances in speech, vision, dexterity and computational power, brings us closer to delivering humanoid robots to address labor shortages for many industries,\u201d said Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure.\nThe company added a second NVIDIA RTX GPU-based module on board Figure 02, which supplies 3x inference gains for handling fully autonomous real-world AI tasks compared with the robot\u2019s first iteration.\n\nFigure aims to commercialize industrial humanoid robots to address labor shortages, and it plans to produce consumer versions.\nFounded in 2022, the startup is partnered with OpenAI to develop custom AI models, trained on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, that drive the robots\u2019 conversational AI capabilities. Figure recently raised $675 million in funding from leading technology companies including NVIDIA.\n\u201cDeveloping autonomous humanoid robots requires the fusion of three computers: NVIDIA DGX for AI training, NVIDIA Omniverse for simulation and NVIDIA Jetson in the robot,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA. \u201cLeading companies, including\u00a0 Figure, are tapping into the NVIDIA robotics stack, from edge to cloud, to drive innovation in humanoid robotics.\u201d\n\nRobotic Hands Capable of Handling Real-World Tasks\nNew human-scale hands, six RGB cameras, and perception AI models trained with synthetic data generated in Isaac Sim enable Figure 02 to perform high-precision pick-and-place tasks required for smart manufacturing applications.\nFigure is among the initial members to join the new NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program, which provides early access to the latest tools and computing technologies for humanoid robot development. This includes the latest releases of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac Lab, NIM microservices (RoboCasa and MimicGen), OSMO, Jetson Thor and Project GR00T general-purpose humanoid foundation models.\nFigure is a member of the\u00a0NVIDIA Inception\u00a0program for cutting-edge startups.\n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Inception | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However, automating India\u2019s toll systems faces an extra complication: the diverse range of license plates.\nIndia\u2019s non-standardized plates pose a significant challenge to the accuracy of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems. Any implementation would need to address these plate variations, which include divergent color, sizing, font styles and placement upon vehicles, as well as many different languages.\nThe solution Calsoft helped build automatically reads passing vehicle plates and charges the associated driver\u2019s UPI account. This approach reduces the need for manual toll collection and is a massive step toward addressing traffic in the region.\nAutomation in Action\nAs part of a pilot program, this solution has been deployed in several leading metropolitan cities. The solution provides about 95% accuracy in its ability to read plates through the use of an ANPR pipeline that detects and classifies the plates as they roll through tollbooths.\nNVIDIA\u2019s technology has been crucial in this effort, according to Vipin Shankar, senior vice president of technology at Calsoft. \u201cParticularly challenging was night-time detection,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother challenge was model accuracy improvement on pixel distortions due to environmental impacts like fog, heavy rains, reflections due to bright sunshine, dusty winds and more.\u201d\nThe solution uses NVIDIA Metropolis to track and detect vehicles throughout the process. Metropolis is an application framework, a set of developer tools and a partner ecosystem that brings visual data and AI together to improve operational efficiency and safety across a range of industries.\nCalsoft engineers used NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software to deploy and manage their AI models. The team also used the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit to build a real-time streaming platform. This was key for processing and analyzing data streams efficiently, incorporating advanced capabilities such as real-time object detection and classification.\nCalsoft uses NVIDIA hardware, including NVIDIA Jetson edge AI modules and NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs in its AI solutions. Calsoft\u2019s tollbooth solution is also scalable, meaning it\u2019s designed to accommodate future growth and expansion needs, and can better ensure sustained performance and adaptability as traffic conditions evolve.\nLearn how NVIDIA Metropolis has helped other municipalities, like Raleigh, North Carolina, better manage traffic flow and enhance pedestrian safety.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | DeepStream | Jetson | Metropolis | NVIDIA Triton | Smart Spaces | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This means the model can enable reliable weather prediction at mesoscale \u2014 a scale larger than storms but smaller than cyclones \u2014 which is critical for disaster planning and mitigation.\nDetailed in a paper written in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Washington, StormCast arrives as extreme weather phenomena are taking lives, destroying homes and causing more than $150 billion in damage annually in the U.S. alone.\nIt\u2019s just one example of how generative AI is supercharging thundering breakthroughs in climate research and actionable extreme weather prediction, helping scientists tackle challenges of the highest stakes: saving lives and the world.\nNVIDIA Earth-2 \u2014 a digital twin cloud platform that combines the power of AI, physical simulations and computer graphics \u2014 enables simulation and visualization of weather and climate predictions at a global scale with unprecedented accuracy and speed.\nAt COMPUTEX in June, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced CorrDiff, available through Earth-2.\nIn Taiwan, for example, the National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction plans to predict fine-scale details of typhoons using CorrDiff, an NVIDIA generative AI model offered as part of Earth-2.\nCorrDiff can super-resolve 25-kilometer-scale atmospheric data by 12.5x down to 2 kilometers \u2014 1,000x faster and using 3,000x less energy for a single inference than traditional methods.\nThat means the center\u2019s potentially lifesaving work, which previously cost nearly $3 million on CPUs, can be accomplished using about $60,000 on a single system with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. It\u2019s a massive reduction that shows how generative AI and accelerated computing increase energy efficiency and lower costs.\nThe center also plans to use CorrDiff to predict downwash \u2014 when strong winds funnel down to street level, damaging buildings and affecting pedestrians \u2014 in urban areas.\n\nNow, StormCast adds hourly autoregressive prediction capabilities to CorrDiff, meaning it can predict future outcomes based on past ones.\nA Global Impact From a Regional Focus\nGlobal climate research begins at a regional level.\nPhysical hazards of weather and climate change can vary dramatically on regional scales. But reliable numerical weather prediction at this level comes with substantial computational costs. This is due to the high spatial resolution needed to represent the underlying fluid-dynamic motions at mesoscale.\nRegional weather prediction models \u2014 often referred to as convection-allowing models, or CAMs \u2014 have traditionally forced researchers to face varying tradeoffs in resolution, ensemble size and affordability.\nCAMs are useful to meteorologists for tracking the evolution and structure of storms, as well as for monitoring its convective mode, or how a storm is organized when it forms. For example, the likelihood of a tornado is based on a storm\u2019s structure and convective mode.\nA mesoscale convective system visualized using NOAA\u2019s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite.

These machine learning models typically have a spatial resolution of about 30 kilometers and a temporal resolution of six hours.\nNow, with the help of generative diffusion, StormCast enables this at a 3-kilometer, hourly scale.\nDespite being in its infancy, the model \u2014 when applied with precipitation radars \u2014 already offers forecasts with lead times of up to six hours that are up to 10% more accurate than the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2019s state-of-the-art 3-kilometer operational CAM.\nPlus, outputs from StormCast exhibit physically realistic heat and moisture dynamics, and can predict over 100 variables, such as temperature, moisture concentration, wind and rainfall radar reflectivity values at multiple, finely spaced altitudes. This enables scientists to confirm the realistic 3D evolution of a storm\u2019s buoyancy \u2014 a first-of-its-kind accomplishment in AI weather simulation.\nNVIDIA researchers trained StormCast on approximately three-and-a-half years of NOAA climate data from the central U.S., using NVIDIA accelerated computing to speed calculations.\nMore Innovations Brewing\nScientists are already looking to harness the model\u2019s benefits.\n\u201cGiven both the outsized impacts of organized thunderstorms and winter precipitation, and the major challenges in forecasting them with confidence, the production of computationally tractable storm-scale ensemble weather forecasts represents one of the grand challenges of numerical weather prediction,\u201d said Tom Hamill, head of innovation at The Weather Company. \u201cStormCast is a notable model that addresses these challenges, and The Weather Company is excited to collaborate with NVIDIA on developing, evaluating and potentially using these deep learning forecast models.\u201d\n\u201cDeveloping high-resolution weather models requires AI algorithms to resolve convection, which is a huge challenge,\u201d said Imme Ebert-Uphoff, machine learning lead at Colorado State University\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere. \u201cThe new NVIDIA research explores the potential of accomplishing this with diffusion models like StormCast, which presents a significant step toward the development of future AI models for high-resolution weather prediction.\u201d\nAlongside the acceleration and visualization of physically accurate climate simulations, as well as a digital twin of our planet, such research breakthroughs signify how NVIDIA Earth-2 is enabling a new, vital era of climate research.\nLearn more about sustainable computing and NVIDIA Research, a global team of hundreds of scientists and engineers focused on topics including climate AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\nFeatured image courtesy of NASA.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | ResearchTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Digital Twin | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Research | Science | Scientific Visualization | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company\u2019s educational initiatives and industry-spanning collaborations are helping students and professionals in biotechnology and life sciences, advanced manufacturing, media and entertainment, and other fields to gain proficiency in harnessing AI to support their work, enhance their productivity and drive innovation.\nSan Jos\u00e9 State University is evaluating how the NVIDIA Omniverse development platform could support the creation of digital twins \u2014 3D virtual representations of real-world systems \u2014 for the city of San Jos\u00e9. During the university\u2019s annual Black Engineer Week in June, NVIDIA hosted dozens of students for a daylong program featuring tech demos and career advice discussions.\nNVIDIA is embarking on several workforce, climate and community-based projects with schools in the University of California and California State University systems. One plans to train students on underwater data center technology, while another is working with California Black Media to train a large language model on nearly a century of journalism by Black journalists in the state.\nThe NVIDIA GTC AI conference, held earlier this year in San Jos\u00e9, featured several sessions for educators to explore how to integrate generative AI and NVIDIA technologies into their curricula \u2014 as well as a panel discussion about the need for equitable access to AI education and resources.\nLearn more about NVIDIA\u2019s AI education resources.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning Institute | Developer Program | Education | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As the Destined One, explore a vast and enchanting world filled with challenges and jaw-dropping wonders. Discover hidden truths behind ancient legends and unveil secrets of a glorious past, enhanced by full ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 3; use the power of the GeForce RTX 40 Series for an unparalleled PC experience.\nNVIDIA has helped elevate Black Myth: Wukong\u2019s graphics and technology to the highest levels. Lighting, effects and immersion are at their very best through the inclusion of realistic full ray tracing, otherwise referred to as path tracing. And the performance to enjoy and experience Black Myth: Wukong at the highest detail levels is delivered by AI powered DLSS 3.\nCombined with the raw power of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, and their AI Tensor Cores and Ray Tracing Cores, PC gamers can marvel at Black Myth: Wukong immersive visuals, and tackle its challenging enemies at fast, responsive frame rates. With GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, you can enjoy a zero-compromise experience in Black Myth: Wukong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull ray tracing is a demanding but highly accurate way to render light and its effect on a scene. This advanced ray tracing technique is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, full ray tracing in real-time video games was impossible.\nIn Black Myth: Wukong full ray tracing increases the fidelity and quality of lighting, reflections and shadows. Reflections on water reflect all surrounding detail. Water caustics add further realism, accurately rendering the refraction and reflection of light. Particles are reflected, making battles more dynamic and exciting. Fully ray-traced lighting ensures lighting indoors and outdoors is pixel perfect, darkening areas where light is occluded or doesn\u2019t reach, and realistically illuminating the world by bouncing light. And in concert with the lighting system, contact hardening and softening fully ray traced shadows are cast everywhere, rendering the smallest of shadows from leaves and pebbles, and those from geometry-rich buildings, the main character, and the gigantic bosses that must be overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead on over to our Black Myth: Wukong launch article to learn even more about the game\u2019s fully ray-traced effects, to see how it performs on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs using DLSS 3 with every setting maxed out. Be sure to also download our Black Myth: Wukong Game Ready Driver for the best possible day-1 experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce NOW: Over 2,000 Games, New Releases Day-One & Automatic Xbox Sign-In \nIf you\u2019re away from home, your PC isn\u2019t up to the task of rendering high fidelity games at high frame rates, or you simply don\u2019t own a modern PC or laptop, you can play the latest releases on NVIDIA GeForce NOW.

As the Galactic Empire relentlessly pursues the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance, the criminal underworld thrives. Fans will play as cunning scoundrel Kay Vess and her loyal companion Nix, as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen. Seeking the means to start a new life, players will join Kay and Nix as they fight, steal, and outwit their way through the galaxy\u2019s crime syndicates and join the galaxy\u2019s most wanted.\nKay and Nix can turn any situation to their advantage: use stealth and gadgets to gain the upper hand, use Nix to distract and draw away enemies, or engage in blaster combat in tense situations throughout their journey. In order to pull off the ultimate heist, Kay and Nix will search for and join forces with a cast of outlaws, including battle-hardened droid ND-5. While stealing valuable goods, infiltrating secret locations, and outwitting enemies, they will need to carefully consider how their choices affect their status with each syndicate, as each move will influence Kay\u2019s ever-changing reputation.\nSTAR WARS TM & \u00a9 2024 Lucasfilm Ltd.

Our initial beta release in February was the first step in our journey to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience and RTX Experience.\nA new update, available now in-app and from our website, adds Display settings, RTX Video Enhancement controls, application sorting, app translations for users in other countries, and more.\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers, enabling quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nRead on to learn more about the new NVIDIA app features, and what\u2019s coming next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Control Center Adds Display & RTX Video Features\u00a0\nIn our new NVIDIA app beta update, the System tab now includes a new Displays section, featuring resolution, refresh rate and orientation controls for connected monitors and TVs. We plan to continue adding more features like G-SYNC controls, Surround options, custom resolutions, and multi-monitor support in the future, so stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a new Video section that adds RTX Video Enhancements and customization sliders for RTX Video HDR. RTX Video HDR instantly converts any Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video playing in internet browsers into vibrant High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos using the power of AI. RTX Video HDR allows all GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their display\u2019s HDR capabilities to display more vivid, dynamic colors in streamed video and local files played on Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and via the VLC media player RTX branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution (VSR) uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs by removing compression artifacts, and sharpening edges when upscaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the System > Video tab in the NVIDIA app, you can easily activate these options, and see in real-time if they\u2019re active when watching video or streams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking the icons next to each feature will open configuration panels. The latest NVIDIA app update adds new sliders for RTX HDR, enabling you to adjust peak brightness, middle grey brightness, contrast, and saturation in real-time as your video plays, making for easy adjustments. For Video Super Resolution, you can manually set the quality level, although we recommend using Auto as it dynamically adjusts quality based on GPU utilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the technology, go to the knowledge base article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates From User Feedback\u00a0\nYour feedback is important to us and we\u2019ve made improvements in a few areas.\u00a0\nOn the Graphics tab, the list of games and apps on your system can now be alphabetically sorted and filtered via the icon highlighted below. And by clicking the three vertically-aligned dots on the top right of the program info, you can hide entries on the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Settings, you can now select different languages for the NVIDIA app, enabling users in other countries to make full use of the app\u2019s options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NVIDIA app beta now supports many languages, as demonstrated in the Spanish example above\nThe Statistics Overlay can now display FPS 1% Low stats, along with real-time statistics for a dozen other stats, including CPU usage, latency, and a full suite of GPU info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ChatRTX Available From NVIDIA App\nNVIDIA ChatRTX is a demo app that lets you personalize a GPT large language model (LLM) connected to your own content\u2014docs, notes, images, or other data. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), TensorRT-LLM, and RTX acceleration, you can query a custom chatbot to quickly get contextually relevant answers. And because it all runs locally on your Windows RTX PC, laptop or workstation, you\u2019ll get fast and secure results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn NVIDIA app\u2019s Home tab, you can now download and install ChatRTX, along with GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast, and other NVIDIA applications. With everything available in one location, it\u2019s easier and faster to enhance your experience and unlock new possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Reward: PC Game Pass\nNVIDIA app users get access to rewards, such as in-game content, exclusive GeForce NOW premium membership offers, and more.

Adjusted for one-time items, net income was $16.95 billion. Revenue rose to $30 billion, up 122% from a year ago and 15% from the previous quarter.By comparison, S&P 500 companies overall are expected to deliver just 5% growth in revenue for the quarter, according to FactSet. Still, Nvidia shares slipped nearly 4% in after-hours trading.Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, said that despite growing revenue \u201cit appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.\u201d\u201cDeath, taxes, and NVDA beats on earnings are three things you can bank on,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cHere\u2019s the issue. The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we\u2019ve been seeing. Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sign for a Nvidia office building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents per share, up from 27 cents a year ago. Nvidia said it expects third quarter revenue to grow to $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said on a call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today.\u201dDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. In June, Nvidia briefly rose to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. The company is now worth over $3 trillion. \n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said during the analyst call that the company is planning to increase production of its Blackwell AI chips beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing through fiscal 2026. Kress said Nvidia expects several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter, with shipments of its Hopper graphics processor unit, or GPU, expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Huang said the company will \u201chave a great next year as well.\u201dThrough the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock price soared nearly 150%. At that point, it was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general. That\u2019s why analysts warn of a selloff if Wall Street sees any indication that AI demand is waning.Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, called the earnings part of a \u201chistoric, meteoric rise from Nvidia and the godfather of AI, Jensen (Huang).\u201d Investors, Ives added, are picking apart \u201crobust numbers\u201d and trying to find holes in them. Although Nvidia said it estimates about $32.5 billion in revenue in the third fiscal quarter, some analysts expected a slightly higher figure, he said.\n\n\u201cI view it as kind of like splitting hairs,\u201d Ives said. The demand for AI technology is only accelerating, he added, echoing Huang\u2019s previous statements that the world is in the midst of the next industrial revolution.\u201cThis is the most watched earnings \u2014 not just in tech, but in the market, in many years,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors will initially overreact to any sort of short-lived weakness. But I believe this actually put more fuel into the tank of the bull market.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARAH PARVINI\n\n\n                Parvini covers artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.

And by expanding the availability of these premium gaming products to a broader audience, more gamers will be able to enjoy the best in motion clarity, image quality and performance.\n\n\nCategories: Gaming \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nNvidia Corp NVDA stock is trading higher Thursday amid reports indicating a fallout in discussions between SoftBank Group Corp SFTBF SFTBY and Intel Corp INTC over an artificial intelligence (AI) chip production.\nReportedly, Arm Holdings Plc ARM parent SoftBank is turning to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM, a key Nvidia supplier.\nIntel failed to meet SoftBank\u2019s demands for volume and speed, the Financial Times cited familiar sources.\nAlso Read: Apple, Intel, And AMD Lead Charge In AI-Capable PC Market Surge: Report\nIntel\u2019s financial struggles, including an April reported $7 billion operating loss in its manufacturing business and subsequent layoffs, likely compounded the difficulties in securing a deal.\nWhile SoftBank\u2019s pivot to Taiwan Semiconductor could still face hurdles due to the latter\u2019s high demand from existing customers, the Japanese group remains committed to advancing its AI chip ambitions.\nThe overall cost of the project could run into tens of billions of dollars, with SoftBank reportedly seeking additional partners like Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL Google and Meta Platforms Inc META to provide the necessary expertise and resources.\nNvidia\u2019s stock has seen a volatile ride. Its selloff makes its valuation more attractive as the AI frenzy is in no mood to slow down. Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 45.05x after losing over 5% in the last 30 days.\nNvidia stock is up over 176% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO and SPDR S&P 500 SPY.\nPrice Action: NVDA shares were trading higher by 3.45% to $122.16 at the last check Thursday.\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto by NP27 on ShutterstockNVDANVIDIA Corp$119.51-0.02%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum85.55Growth88.64Quality97.50Value6.95Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewARMARM Holdings PLC$121.410.03%GOOGAlphabet Inc$166.600.02%GOOGLAlphabet Inc$164.450.10%INTCIntel Corp$25.930.94%METAMeta Platforms Inc$604.90-%SFTBFSoftBank Group Corp$62.2719.9%SFTBYSoftBank Group Corp$27.14-%SPYSPDR S&P 500$567.15-%TSMTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd$176.290.42%VOOVanguard S&P 500 ETF$521.470.01%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

But for a company that\u2019s been on a stunning growth streak over the past two years, merely great numbers may no longer be enough to impress investors.\n    \n\n            The AI chipmaker \u2014 whose stock has helped power the market\u2019s feverish rally this year \u2014 reported more than $30 billion in sales in its fiscal second quarter, up 122% from the same period a year ago, and ahead of the $28.7 billion Wall Street analysts had expected. Profits from the quarter also more than doubled to $16.6 billion, up from the $15 billion analyst projection.\n    \n\n            The company also posted modestly better-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter, another encouraging sign for investors.\n    \n\n            Still, Nvidia shares dipped as much as 5% in after-hours trading following the report.\n    \n\n            Nvidia\u2019s peerless AI processors have helped fuel a boom in AI technologies across the tech sector, as well as an AI craze on Wall Street. The company\u2019s shares are up a dizzying 154% this year and more than 3,000% over the past five years, thanks to the AI frenzy. The company\u2019s market value is now over $3 trillion, one of only three US companies ever to achieve that milestone.\n    \n\n            But major questions have started to emerge about the sustainability of the AI hype cycle, in large part because of uncertainty about whether \u2014 and how soon \u2014 the technology will contribute to tech giants\u2019 bottom lines.\n    \n\n            What\u2019s more, there\u2019s only so long any company can continue to grow at such a fast clip. While Nvidia beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the top and bottom lines, investors appeared disappointed that it didn\u2019t beat by a wider margin. And rumors about potential delays in the company\u2019s latest AI chips, called Blackwell, had contributed to worries leading into the earnings report, although executives said during Wednesday night\u2019s earnings call that Nvidia still expects to begin earning revenue from Blackwell in this fiscal year.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, California, on March 18, 2024.\n\nJosh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nHow a company whose name you probably can\u2019t pronounce is now worth more than Apple\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cWhile the numbers indicate that the AI revolution remains alive and well, the smaller beat compared to the previous quarters adds to the multiple warning signs across the tech space earlier in this earnings season,\u201d Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro said in an email.\n    \n\n            Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that while demand for Blackwell \u201cfar exceeds its supply\u201d in a Bloomberg interview Wednesday, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have lots and lots of supply, and we will be able to ramp starting in Q4.\u201d\n    \n\n            The trajectory of Nvidia shares has power ripple effects across the broader market, thanks to the company\u2019s outsized, roughly 7% weighting in the S&P 500.\n    \n\n            The company\u2019s \u201cearnings report has become the world\u2019s most important financial news event,\u201d Bespoke Investment group wrote in a Wednesday note.\n    \n\n            Despite investors\u2019 skittishness, business doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down for the chipmaker yet.\n    \n\n            Nvidia\u2019s data center business continues to be the leading driver of its success, a sign that the demand for AI infrastructure in the tech sector is not slowing down. The company raked in nearly $26.3 billion in data center sales, which comprised 87% of its total revenue.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe company continues to benefit from a market paradox: Big Tech\u2019s aggressive AI investment strategies drive massive demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips, even as these same companies invest in developing their own silicon,\u201d Emarketer technology analyst Jacob Bourne said in an emailed statement.\n    \n\n            Indeed, Silicon Valley heavyweights continue to expand their investments in AI infrastructure, much of which will go to purchasing chips from Nvidia. In their own earnings reports earlier this month, Google, Microsoft and Meta Platforms all signaled that they would be upping their AI spending.\n    \n\n            Meta said it expects full-year capital expenditures to be between $37 billion and $40 billion, raising the low end of its guidance from the previous quarter by $2 billion. Microsoft said it expects to spend more in fiscal year 2025 than its $56 billion in capital expenditures from 2024. Google projected capital expenditure spending \u201cat or above\u201d $12 billion for each quarter this year. (Even for extremely rich companies, those are big numbers \u2014 for Google, its second quarter capital expenditures amounted to about 17% of its total sales).\n    \n\n            Despite concerns about potential Blackwell delays, research firm Third Bridge estimates that 60-70% of AI model training at so-called hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google will take place using the new Nvidia chips by the end of next year, according to analyst Lucas Keh.\n    \n\n            Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang defended the company\u2019s runway during a call with analysts Wednesday following the report, reminding them that the company\u2019s chips don\u2019t just power AI chatbots but also ad targeting systems, search engines, robotics and recommendation algorithms like the ones behind social media feeds.\n    \n\n            \u201cPeople who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d Huang said, adding that the company\u2019s more powerful chips process data more efficiently, saving clients money. \u201cIn the future, every single data center will have GPUs,\u201d the kind of chip that Nvidia has become known for, Huang said.\n    \n\n            Together, those factors should mean that even if the Nvidia stock hype \u2014 which has reached such a point that people had organized earnings call listening parties as if it were a championship game \u2014 dies down, the company\u2019s fundamentals should remain strong for the foreseeable future.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN Business Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEEP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCould humans live underwater?

The results, whether better or worse than Wall Street is expecting, will have perhaps the biggest effect on the stock market moving forward than any other news.As proof: Reuters reported that options pricing suggests traders believe Nvidia\u2019s stock will move by about 9.8 percent on Thursday, the first trading day after the earnings report, citing data from analytics firm ORATS. If the data is right, whichever way the stock moves will have a huge impact on a number of hedge funds with big bets on Nvidia.One of the hedge funds with the largest exposure to Nvidia is Glen Kacher\u2019s Light Street Capital Management. At the end of the second quarter, the stock was its largest U.S.-listed long position, accounting for more than 16 percent of the U.S. common stock portfolio, according to the latest 13F filing. In the second quarter, Light Street cut its stake by 26 percent. Light Street\u2019s long-short fund was up 40.3 percent for the year through July, and the long-only fund was up nearly 32 percent, says someone who has seen the results.Morris Mark\u2019s Mark Asset Management also counted Nvidia as its largest U.S.-listed long at the end of June, making up more than 14 percent of its U.S. common stock long assets, according to its latest regulatory filing. Mark reduced the position by about 10 percent in the second quarter. Its long-short fund was up 22.66 percent for the year through July, according to a hedge fund database.And Nvidia is the largest U.S. long of Jericho Capital Asset Management, accounting for about 9.4 percent of U.S. assets, according to Jericho\u2019s recent filing. The firm stood pat with its position in the second quarter. It was up 27 percent through July, according to an investor.At the end of the second quarter, Nvidia was the sixth most widely held stock among hedge funds, with 296 investors, according to SEI Novus.Elsewhere, Alex Sacerdote\u2019s Whale Rock Capital Management counts Nvidia as its largest long, responsible for 8.5 percent of U.S. assets. However, in the second quarter, it cut its stake by about 40 percent.In the same quarter, Nvidia became the largest long of Nehal Chopra\u2019s Ratan Capital Management, accounting for nearly 17 percent of assets after the firm boosted its stake by about 165 percent, according to its latest 13F filing.\n\n\n        U.S.\u2003Glen Kacher\u2003Light Street Capital Management\u2003Alex Sacerdote\u2003Nehal Chopra\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nCopy\nLink copied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Print\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\nMasthead\n\nAbout Us\n\nCareers\n\nManagement\n\nCustomer Service\n\nFAQs\n\nCookies\n\nReprints\n\nII Press Room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\n\n\nAbout Thought Leadership\n\nDisplay Advertising\n\nCustom Research\n\nContact Thought Leadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nII Forums\n\nII Memberships\n\nII Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscription\n\n\nSubscribe to Premium\n\n\nRegister\n\nRegister for Free Account\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\nSign up for II newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Institutional Investor LLC.
