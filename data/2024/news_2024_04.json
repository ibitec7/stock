The company also owns Cuda, an AI training software. I\u2019m bearish on Nvidia, which trades at 76x earnings and what are likely peak profit margins. I believe the company is more cyclical than most people think. Nvidia, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in electric vehicles, has enjoyed a first-mover advantage in AI. The problem is that, like Tesla in electric vehicles, the competition has increased exponentially, and the company is cyclical and vulnerable to a recession.   NVDA stock has gained 1,745% in the past five years.  A Terrific Company, But More Cyclical Than You Think Nvidia is no doubt a revolutionary company. The AI language models that it helps power are changing the world. Search has become faster and easier than ever before, and AI will not stop there, with many more use cases on the horizon. However, much of this revolution is now baked into Nvidia\u2019s financials, with net income having increased from $4.37 billion in year-end 2023 to $29.76 billion in year-end 2024. This is an enormous increase.  Nvidia and the AI revolution look comparable to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Internet revolution of the late 1990s. I recently checked Intel\u2019s financials from 1993-2000, the period marked by the inception of the Internet. Intel\u2019s net income increased at a much slower pace than Nvidia\u2019s. It took seven years for Intel\u2019s net income to increase 360% vs. one year for Nvidia\u2019s net income to increase 581%. During the recession of 2001, as the Internet bubble deflated, Intel\u2019s net income collapsed 88% from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001. I suspect Nvidia\u2019s profits will be no less cyclical than Intel\u2019s. Yet, the market is pricing in an unending upward trend in the company\u2019s earnings. The fact that Nvidia\u2019s net income increased so fast means there\u2019s less growth ahead, not more. If Nvidia\u2019s customers suffer in a recession, which I believe they will, Nvidia will suffer too in terms of falling earnings. In Nvidia\u2019s annual report, the company outlined these risks, saying, \u201cBecause most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty.\u201d Competition Is Coming Nvidia\u2019s operating margin is at a record high of 54%, but if we look at the company\u2019s history, its average operating margin is closer to just 20%. In a cyclical industry like chip designing, this is a red flag. It means earnings could fall more than 50% just to get back to the norm. In recessions, things can get even worse. Nvidia\u2019s operating margin approached the low single digits in the recession of 2003 and went negative in 2009.   Story Continues There are two reasons Nvidia\u2019s margins could contract. One is the economic weakness we discussed earlier, which could affect Nvidia\u2019s customers. Two is increasing competition, which is now coming from everywhere, including Nvidia\u2019s own customers.This risk was outlined in Nvidia\u2019s annual report, which stated, \u201cOur partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.\u201dAll the semiconductor investment we\u2019re seeing, spurred by AI hype and governmental support, is bad news for Nvidia. Big tech companies are spending billions on in-house solutions, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel are racing to catch up, and China is attempting to become semiconductor self-reliant.I hate industries that are seeing a lot of investment and increasing competition because that\u2019s usually bad for future profit margins. Nvidia was developing AI solutions in a sleepy market for years, but that has all changed now. AI is the hottest market there is, and new competitors are spending R&D money hand over fist. For this reason, I cannot be sure who will have the technological edge in 10 years\u2019 time. Just as Intel has, Nvidia could easily lose its edge over the years.NVDA Stock\u2019s Valuation Is ExtremeDespite having seen its net income and margins explode upwards, Nvidia is now trading at 76x earnings, 36x sales, and 51x book. Normally, you see the market pricing in that a company is nearing a cyclical peak when earnings surge 581% year-over-year by assigning lower multiples. However, this is certainly not the case for Nvidia.Is NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Currently, 39 out of 41 analysts covering NVDA give it a Buy rating, two rate it a Hold, and zero analysts rate it a Sell, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average Nvidia stock price target\u00a0is $989.53, implying upside potential of 9.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $620 per share to a high of $1,400 per share.  The Bottom Line on NVDA StockI believe Nvidia is comparable to Intel near the peak of the dot-com bubble. Intel benefited from the Internet boom, with a dominant position in semiconductors used in PCs and technologies used for Wi-Fi. However, as competition increased, overinvestment ran rampant, and demand fell, Intel\u2019s stock and earnings collapsed alongside those of other dot-com names.The same could happen to Nvidia as semiconductor investment has surged in big tech land and China. With a 581% year-over-year increase in earnings, Nvidia\u2019s profits could be nearing a peak. The next recession may mark the end as orders for Nvidia\u2019s products can quickly be canceled due to an industry-specific downturn, wide-scale recession, or substitution for another company\u2019s products.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Before we begin the analysis, let\u2019s examine the industry dynamics.\nAmidst the ongoing surge in global chip demand, the semiconductor industry stands as a beacon of stability, promising sustained expansion. With increased government incentives and a surge in fab investments amplifying this momentum, the chips sector is not just thriving but also a safe bet for investors.\nIDC\u2019s latest research predicts a promising future for the semiconductor industry, fueled by the surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), smartphones, personal computers, infrastructure, and automotive sectors.\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing growth due to rising demand for high-energy and power-efficient devices, along with increased use in wireless, portable electronics, and automotive electrification. The Semiconductor Industry is expected to grow from $720 billion this year to $1.21 trillion by 2029 at a CAGR of 10.9%. NVDA and TSM are well-placed to take advantage of the industry\u2019s favorable conditions.\n\n\nIn terms of price performance, NVDA has declined 4.3% over the past month, while TSM gained 1.5% during the same period.\nGiven below are the reasons why I think TSM could dominate in the second quarter:\nLatest Developments\nOn April 16, 2024, NVDA introduced two new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based desktop GPUs: the NVIDIA RTX A400 and NVIDIA RTX A1000. These GPUs provide access to AI and ray-tracing technology, empowering professionals to elevate their workflows.\n2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOKOn the flip side, on April 8, TSM announced a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.60 billion in funding under the CHIPS and Science Act. They also revealed plans for a third fab in Arizona to meet high customer demand, bringing their total investment in the site to over $65 billion.\nTSM sees this investment as an opportunity to provide advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and better support their U.S. customers while pioneering future semiconductor technology advancements.\nRecent Financial Results\nNVDA\u2019s non-GAAP revenue rose 265.3% year-over-year to $22.10 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on January 28, 2024. Its non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS came in at $12.84 billion and $5.16 per share, up 490.6% and 486.4% from the prior year\u2019s period, respectively.\n\n\nHowever, its operating expenses rose 9.1% year-over-year to $2.21 billion. As of January 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s total\u00a0current liabilities\u00a0stood at $10.63 billion, up from $6.56 billion as of January 29, 2023.\nIn contrast, during the fourth quarter, which ended December 31, 2023, TSM reported net revenue of NT$625.53 billion ($19.27 billion). Its net income and\u00a0EPS\u00a0amounted to NT$238.31 billion ($7.34 billion) and NT$9.21, respectively.\nMoreover, as of December 31, 2023, TSM\u2019s total current liabilities decreased 3.2% year-over-year to $913.58 billion ($28.15 billion).\nPast and Expected Financial Performance\nOver the past three years, NVDA\u2019s revenue and EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 54% and 81%, while net income and EPS saw respective CAGRs of 90.1% and 90.3%.\nAnalysts expect the company\u2019s revenue to rise 237.7% in the current quarter and 83% this year. Its EPS is likely to grow 405.9% in the current quarter and 92.1% this year.\nOn the other hand, TSM\u2019s revenue and EBITDA rose at a CAGR of 17.3% and 17.4%, respectively, over the past three years. In addition, the company\u2019s net income and EPS both increased at an 18% CAGR over the same time.\nStreet expects TSM\u2019s EPS to improve marginally in the to-be-reported quarter and 21.7% this year. Its revenue is estimated to rise 8.3% in the to-be-reported quarter and 20.3% this year.\nProfitability\nTSM is more profitable, with a trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 66.84%, which is higher than NVDA\u2019s 56.60%. TSM\u2019s trailing-12-month cash from operations of $40.46 billion compares with NVDA\u2019s $28.09 billion.\nValuation\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, TSM is trading at 22.17x, which is lower than NVDA\u2019s 35.12x. TSM\u2019s forward EV/Sales of 7.37x is lower than NVDA\u2019s 19.16x. Furthermore, TSM\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA of 10.84x compares with NVDA\u2019s 29.79x.\n\n\nThus, TSM is more affordable.\nPOWR Ratings\nNVDA has an overall rating of C, which equates to Neutral in our proprietary\u00a0POWR Ratings\u00a0system. Conversely, TSM has an overall rating of B, translating to Buy. The POWR Ratings are calculated considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.\nOur proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. NVDA receives an F grade for Stability, which is consistent with its 24-month beta of 1.84. Conversely, TSM earns a B grade for Stability, aligning with its 24-month beta of 0.95, .\n\n\nIn the\u00a091-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip\u00a0industry, NVDA is ranked #27, while TSM is ranked #8.\nBeyond what we\u2019ve stated above, we have also rated both stocks for Growth, Value, Momentum, Quality, and Sentiment.\u00a0Click here\u00a0to view NVDA\u2019s ratings.\u00a0Get all TSM ratings\u00a0here.\nThe Winner\nThe semiconductor industry is experiencing growth due to rising demand for high-energy and power-efficient devices, along with increased use in wireless, portable electronics, and automotive electrification.\n\n\nFuture forecasts anticipate a revival spurred by increased demand for AI chips and the rebound of the smartphone market. Driven by substantial technological advancements and heightened investment, this upward trend promises a future marked by innovation and economic growth.\nIn this ever-changing industry landscape, NVDA and TSM stand out as major players poised to capitalize on market dynamics. However, TSM\u2019s lower valuation and increased stability could make it a more attractive investment option compared to NVDA in the second quarter.\nOur research shows that the odds of success increase when one invests in stocks with an overall rating of Strong Buy.

Jim Cramer has been sharing his thoughts about the latest market pullback on his programs on CNBC. Last week, Cramer said that after major wins stocks tend to decline and that\u2019s exactly what happened recently when winners saw sharp declines on April 10 when the market saw a \u201ctough session\u201d for the \"winners\". Cramer said that it\u2019s \u201castonishing\u201d that how some of the \u201cgreat stocks\u201d got \u201cpummeled\u201d while \u201csub-par performers\u201d of the last year \u201cfinally had their day in the sun.\u201d Cramer Talks Nvidia VS Intel Cramer talked about some stocks he liked that recently saw a pullback, including NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY). Cramer said part of the reason why NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell was concerns that the competition for the chip company might be heating up with Intel launching its new chips. Intel has revealed its AI-focused chip called Gaudi 3, and the company claimed it's faster than Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPU. Cramer said that when he read about Intel\u2019s latest chip, he \u201cgulped\u201d until he read the claims Intel made about Gaudi 2 back in 2022. Cramer said that if he hadn\u2019t been \u201cwell versed\u201d with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), he would have been \u201ctempted\u201d to sell NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares back in 2022 when the stock was trading at just $175. At that time, Intel made claims that its new chips had twice the training throughput of Nvidia A-100 chips. But, according to Cramer, Intel\u2019s Gaudi 2 chips failed to make any waves. However, Cramer said that it\u2019s possible that Intel\u2019s Gaudi 3 is faster than Nvidia\u2019s chips in some \"categories\" but by the time this chip reaches market, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) would have launched its \u201cmuch, much faster\u201d Blackwell. Jim Cramer said that in the Nvidia versus Intel battle, it\u2019s not just about the chips. \u201cIt\u2019s the software, it\u2019s the ecosystem, it\u2019s the platform, it\u2019s the leadership.\u201d  Cramer said Gaudi 3 would likely be \u201cas useless as\u201d Gaudi 2. Cramer Thinks Nvidia Stock Could Fall in the Coming Days Jim Cramer, however, said that he\u2019s no longer saying \u201cbuy, buy, buy\u201d for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) since there\u2019s a chance the stock would fall if Google unveils its own chip. But Cramer said his advice for investors when it comes to Nvidia is to \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it.\u201d   Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks in April   Jim Cramer's Thoughts on Elon Musk In another program, Jim Cramer talked about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and how the media becomes all the praise for the billionaire when Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are going higher. But when the stock nosedives, like it is in 2024 (down 33% so far), news outlets grill Musk and criticize his personality, his handling of Twitter and Tesla cars. Cramer said that he thinks Elon Musk is \u201cbrilliant\u201d and calling him an \u201cevil genius\u201d is \u201cunfair.\u201d Cramer also talked about how the media uses Elon Musk\u2019s name to gain more \u201ceyeballs\u201d and \u201cpage views.\u201d   Story Continues Musk is back in the news on April 15 morning after The Wall Street Journal reported the billionaire, in an email to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) employees, announced to cut 10% of the global workforce.Methodology For this article, we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired in April so far and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy and hold.10. Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 13Jim Cramer thinks the US government\u2019s pause on LNG expansion until 2028 is not going to hold, which is why he recommended buying Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE) for the long term. Cramer thinks Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE) is going to \u201cfly\u201d if the US government reverses its decision to halt LNG projects expansion, which, according to Cramer, is one of the \u201cdumber\u201d things the current administration has done.Last month, during an earnings call, the company talked about guidance:\"For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $315 million and $335 million. As Steven mentioned, the fixed fee revenues from our FSRUs and terminals create an exceptional foundation for sustainable growth. As part of our financial plan this year, we expect to see an increase in business development expense as compared to last year as we advance on our commercial growth opportunities that Steven referenced earlier. These business development costs, which are estimated about $20 million are included in our guidance range and will be reported within our selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement. Also included in our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance is the impact of a planned first quarter dry dock for the FSRU summit LNG. Read the full earnings call transcript here.9. New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 24Jim Cramer recently said in a program that US government\u2019s pause on LNG terminal expansion is hurting New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE). Cramer said he \u201clikes\u201d New Fortress Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NFE). He thinks the pause is \u201coutrageous\u201d and believes LNG is \u201cgreat for energy security\u201d and for \u201cour allies.\u201d8. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 37Jim Cramer hit \u201cbuy, buy, buy\u201d button on PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) in a latest program when he was asked about the Pennsylvania-based financial services company. Cramer said he does not understand why the stock is down. Cramer praised PNC Financial Services Group Inc's (NYSE:PNC) 4% dividend yield and said you should buy some PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) shares now and then buy more next week if the stock goes down after earnings. In addition to PNC, Cramer is also talking about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) during his shows these days.Artisan Value Fund stated the following regarding The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\u201cBanks were well represented among our top Q4 performers as the Treasury market rally drove big gains in the bank stocks. US Bancorp (USB),\u00a0The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:PNC) and Bank of America\u2014the three banks we hold in the portfolio\u2014were each among our top five contributors to return. When bank stocks sold off in Q1 due to fears of contagion following Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure, we took advantage of the market dislocation by purchasing top-10 US banks USB and PNC at what were, in our view, cheap prices. USB and PNC are banks we have known for years. They are well managed and well capitalized. As large banks, they were less impacted by the turmoil that affected smaller institutions as depositors sought the safest places to store their money. The recent rebound is an example of how our approach of investing in out-of-favor businesses can lead to alpha. USB and PNC are not immune from industry-wide headwinds from higher deposit costs, pressured net interest margins and fleeing deposits. However, we did not see these banks having a similar level of risk, with respect to uninsured deposits and unrealized losses, which contributed in varying degrees to the collapses of other banks in March 2023. As investors, we cannot avoid risk. However, we are willing to take risk if we are being compensated appropriately.\u201d 7. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 38While giving positive comments about power generation company Cummins in his latest program, Cramer also pitched PACCAR Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PCAR), the Washington-based large commercial trucks company. Earlier this year Cramer had called PACCAR Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PCAR)\u00a0a \u201ctrue innovator.\u201dLike PCAR, Jim Cramer is also talking about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).6. Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 39Jim Cramer was recently asked about power generation and engines company Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI). Cramer hit the buy button for the stock and said he likes the stock \u201cvery much.\u201d The company talked about guidance and future plans during a latest earnings call:\"We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023.

This Is the Best Semiconductor ETF to Invest In Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Other Megatrends.\n\n\n  \n      By Beth McKenna\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Apr 15, 2024 at 8:00AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global semiconductor market should grow robustly for years, driven by massive trends, including artificial intelligence (AI), vehicle electrification, and autonomous driving.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on a specific industry can be a less risky way to gain exposure to that industry, relative to investing in individual stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF has 25 stock holdings and invests in the entire chip manufacturing value chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-1.69%)\u00a0-$2.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.50\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis top-performing semiconductor exchange-traded fund's (ETF's) largest holding is Nvidia stock, which accounts for 20% of its total portfolio.\n\nIn 2024, the global semiconductor (or chip) market is projected to grow more than 13% to nearly $600 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Moreover, this market should reach $1 trillion in revenue by 2030, per top consulting firm McKinsey & Company. These rosy growth projections are being driven by several massive global trends that are in their early innings, including artificial intelligence (AI), vehicle electrification, and autonomous driving, according to McKinsey.\nBuying Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) stock is one way to gain exposure to these trends. The company's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips have a dominant share of the data center AI market, whose growth has greatly accelerated due to generative AI. (This is the tech behind OpenAI's incredibly popular chatbot, ChatGPT.) And while Nvidia's auto business is still relatively small, it has the potential for huge growth once driverless vehicles become legal across the United States and beyond.\nSome investors are understandably hesitant to buy Nvidia stock after its rapid run-up. The stock has soared 233% and 480% over the last year and three years, respectively, as of April 12. One great way to get considerable exposure to this top-performing stock but with less risk than buying it is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is heavily weighted with Nvidia stock: VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH -0.93%).\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: The best-performing semiconductor ETF\nAmong semiconductor ETFs with at least a three-year trading history, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF has the best returns over the short, medium, and longer terms.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF began trading in December 2011, so it has a solid track record, at least compared other semiconductor ETFs. It's easily outperformed the S&P 500 index (widely considered the best proxy for the overall U.S. stock market) over the short, medium, and longer terms, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nETF/Index\n\n\nYear-To-Date 2024 Return\n\n\n1-Year Return \n\n\n3-Year Return\n\n\n5-Year Return\n\n\n10-Year Return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF\n\n26.2%\n77.4%\n78.4%\n305%\n1,030%\n\n\nS&P 500\n7.9%\n27.2%\n30.1%\n91.6%\n240%\n\n\n\nData source: YCharts. Data as of April 12, 2024.\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: The basics\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is an index fund that's designed to track the performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. This index consists of a portfolio of worldwide companies involved in the semiconductor value chain -- from chip design and production to the manufacturing of equipment used for making chips. As this index's name suggests, it has 25 stock holdings and all the stocks are listed on a major U.S. stock exchange. \nIt's a positive that the index upon which this ETF is based favors large companies, in my view. Large companies in the semiconductor space benefit from economies of scale, including usually having greater bargaining power with suppliers and subcontractors than their smaller peers.\nThis ETF has a reasonable total expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF: Top 10 stock holdings\n\n\n\n\nHolding No. \n\n\n Company\n\n\nMarket Cap \n\n\nWall Street's Projected Annualized EPS Growth Over Next 5 Years\n\n\nWeight (% of Portfolio)*\n\n\n5-Year Return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\n$2.2 trillion\n\n37.9%\n\n20.39%\n\n\n1,770%\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.12%)\n\n$739 billion\n\n4.3%\n\n12.70%\n\n282%\n\n\n\n3\n\nBroadcom\n$623 billion\n14.4%\n7.93%\n398%\n\n\n\n4\n\nASML Holding \n$378 billion\n21.7%\n4.93%\n401%\n\n\n5\nMicron Technology\n$136 billion\n(2.6%)\n4.72%\n197%\n\n\n\n6\n\nQualcomm\n$191 billion\n8.3%\n4.68%\n240%\n\n\n\n7\n\nApplied Materials\n$173 billion\n14.3%\n4.51%\n410%\n\n\n8\nLam Research\n$125 billion\n9.4%\n4.50%\n428%\n\n\n\n9\n\nTexas Instruments \n$151 billion\n10%\n4.47%\n63.7%\n\n\n\n10\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.52%)\n$264 billion\n25%\n4.04%\n486%\n\n\n\nTotal Top 10\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n72.87%\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nOverall ETF\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nTotal net assets of $18.8 billion\n\nN/A\n\n100%\n\n305%\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nS&P 500\n\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n91.6%\n\n\n\nData sources: VanEck Semiconductor ETF, Yahoo! Finance, and YCharts. EPS = earnings per share. *Portfolio weight as of April 11, 2024. All other data as of April 12, 2024.\nThe 10 top holdings above fall into these broad categories:\n\nChip producers: Nvidia (No. 1), Broadcom (3), Micron (5), Qualcomm (6), Texas Instruments (9), and Advanced Micro Devices (10).\nFoundries: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2). TSM produces chips for companies that contract out some or all their chip manufacturing. Nvidia is one such company. It's a so-called \"fabless chip maker\" because it doesn't do any of its chip fabrication in-house. Indeed, Wall Street analysts estimate that Nvidia was TSM's second-largest customer in 2023. So TSM is benefiting significantly from Nvidia's incredible growth.\nSemiconductor equipment manufacturers: ASML (4), Applied Materials (7), and Lam Research (8).\n\nWhat data pops out at you in the above table other than the stock performance data? Perhaps one or both items:\n\nLargest holding: Nvidia is not only the ETF's largest holding, but it is by far the heaviest weighted. This is a positive if you want considerable exposure to this top-performing stock, but are hesitant to buy it for whatever reason. That could include being concerned it's run up too quickly and is overvalued, or you might simply prefer investing in baskets of stocks within an industry rather than in individual stocks.\nBest projected earnings growth: Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are projected by Wall Street analysts to have the best average annual earnings growth over the next five years. These two companies are the No. 1 (by far) and No. 2, respectively, producers of discrete GPUs. GPUs are the favored chips for training artificial intelligence models and running AI applications in data centers. Given the rapid adoption of AI by companies and other entities, it makes sense that Nvidia and AMD have the highest consensus earnings estimates.\n\nA great ETF for investing in the AI and other humongous global growth trends\nThe semiconductor industry is poised for decades of strong growth, thanks to several humongous global growth trends that are in their early stages, including AI, the electrification of the world's vehicle fleet, and autonomous driving.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF is an attractive way for investors to invest in these trends. Its diversification makes it a less risky way to gain exposure to the chip space, relative to buying individual stocks.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Five fast-growing companies are likely to surpass it in market cap by 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-1.69%)\u00a0-$2.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.50\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has added $1.9 trillion in market cap in 15 months. But if history rhymes and the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble bursts, five industry-leading businesses could leapfrog it in value.\n\nOver the last 30 years, no next-big-thing trend or innovation has come close to rivaling the advent of the internet. However, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to do for businesses in this generation what the internet did for corporate America three decades ago.\nBy the turn of the decade, analysts at PwC foresee AI, which relies on software and systems in place of human oversight, increasing global gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion. No company has more directly benefited from the AI revolution than semiconductor stock Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%).\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock may be in a bubble\nOver the span of 15 months, Nvidia's valuation has soared by $1.9 trillion to $2.26 trillion, which ranks behind only Microsoft and Apple among publicly traded companies in the U.S.\nNvidia's outperformance is a reflection of the overwhelming demand for its high-powered A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Some analysts believe Nvidia's top-tier chips could account for more than 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. The early stage scarcity associated with these chips has afforded Nvidia exceptional pricing power.\nBut there are also plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia is in a bubble.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, every next-big-thing trend and innovation over the last three decades has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have a habit of overestimating the adoption of new technology, and I don't anticipate AI being the exception.\nNvidia is also likely to see its pricing power wane in the quarters to come as new competitors enter the space and the company's own production reduces the scarcity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Nvidia's 217% data-center sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) can be traced to its pricing power.\n\nThe chief concern might just be that its top four customers, which are \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents and comprise roughly 40% of its sales, are all developing in-house AI chips for their data centers. One way or another, Nvidia's orders from its top customers are liable to taper off in the quarters to come.\nIf history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, Nvidia's market cap could crater (in context to where it is now) and allow other companies to leapfrog it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are five companies -- not including Microsoft and Apple, which are already ahead of Nvidia -- which have the tools and intangibles to be worth more than Nvidia three years from now.\n1. Alphabet: $1.88 trillion current market cap (Class A shares, GOOGL)\nThe first industry titan that shouldn't have any trouble surpassing Nvidia's market cap over the coming three years is Alphabet (GOOGL -2.27%) (GOOG -2.35%), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous-driving company Waymo, among other ventures.\nThe reason Alphabet would hold up substantially better than Nvidia if the AI bubble bursts is because it's a veritable monopoly in internet search. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share. Looking back through nine years of monthly data from GlobalStats, Google hasn't ceded more than 10% of global internet search share to all other companies, combined. It's the clear-and-obvious choice for advertisers looking to get their message in front of users, and it's going to benefit immensely from long periods of domestic and international growth.\nGoogle Cloud can also thrive if Nvidia stumbles. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, and Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service share, as of September 2023. Since cloud margins are traditionally juicier than advertising margins, Alphabet's cash flow growth may accelerate in the latter-half of the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Amazon: $1.87 trillion current market cap\nLike Alphabet, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (AMZN -1.09%) can jump back ahead of Nvidia at some point over the next three years if the AI bubble deflates.\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace. In 2023, an estimated 38% of online retail spending in the U.S. was traced to its e-commerce site. But the real benefit of having more than 2 billion people visit Amazon's website each month is the advertising revenue it can generate, and the subscription revenue brought in via Prime. Amazon topped 200 million Prime users in April 2021, and has almost certainly added to this figure since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\nHowever, Amazon's premier cash flow driver is its cloud infrastructure service platform. Despite accounting for a sixth of the company's net sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS) consistently generates 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income. AWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform by spend, per Canalys.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Meta Platforms: $1.24 trillion current market cap\nEven though social media company Meta Platforms (META -3.26%) is betting on a future fueled by AI and augmented/virtual reality, the company's core operations should sustain double-digit earnings growth and help lift its valuation well past Nvidia come 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta's \"secret sauce\" is no secret at all. Despite its metaverse ambitions and big spending at Reality Labs, the company's bread-and-butter continues to be its social media empire. It's the parent of the most-visited social site on the planet (Facebook), and collectively attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter with its family of apps. Just as advertisers willingly pay a premium to Alphabet's Google because of its dominance in internet search, Meta's ad-pricing power tends to be superior in most economic climates.\nThe other reason Meta can shine and completely close the roughly $1 trillion valuation gap between it and Nvidia over the coming three years is its balance sheet. Meta is a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year and closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Not only does this cash provide a buffer to the downside, but it affords Meta the luxury of taking chances that few other companies can match.\n\nBerkshire CEO Warren Buffett has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A). BRK.A data by YCharts.\n4. Berkshire Hathaway: $908 billion current market cap (Class A shares, BRK.A)\nA fourth company that can surpass AI stock Nvidia's market cap over the course of the next three years is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.14%) (BRK.B 0.04%). Since Warren Buffett took the reins at Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s, he's overseen an annualized average return on his company's Class A shares that's approaching 20%!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the primary reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been such a moneymaker for investors is the \"Oracle of Omaha's\" love of dividend stocks. Berkshire is on track to collect in the neighborhood of $6 billion in payouts this year, with just five core holdings accounting for almost $4.4 billion in aggregate dividend income. Since dividend-paying companies are often profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses we'd expect to grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy over long periods.\nWarren Buffett and his investment team also gravitate to brand-name businesses with trusted management teams. For instance, the $155 billion invested in Apple adds up to almost 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets. Apple is one of the world's most-valuable brands, and CEO Tim Cook has done a masterful job of leading ongoing physical product innovation while also pivoting the company to a subscription services-driven future.\n\n5. Visa: $573 billion current market cap\nThe fifth stock that'll be worth more than artificial intelligence stock Nvidia three years from now is payment-processing behemoth Visa (V -0.10%). As things stand now, Visa will have to close a nearly $1.7 trillion valuation gap. But if the AI bubble pops and Visa keeps doing what it's been doing for decades, it can happen.\nWhat makes Visa tick is the company's long runway of opportunity. It's the undisputed market share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the largest market for consumption globally), and has a multidecade opportunity to organically or acquisitively push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. Visa should be able to sustain a double-digit earnings growth rate throughout the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa's other source of success is its relatively conservative management team. Although it would probably be wildly successful as a lender, its leaders have chosen to keep the company solely focused on payment facilitation. The advantage of this approach is that Visa doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses during economic downturns since it's not a lender. The result is a profit margin that's consistently hovered at or above 50%!\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "response": "Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Trending Lower Recently as Earnings Loom | tastylive\n\nOPEN A tastytrade ACCOUNTFAQGlossaryHelp CenterSign UpLog Intastylive BlogNvidia Ahead of Earnings: Bullish or Bearish?Image courtesy of ShutterstockApr 11, 2024Nvidia Ahead of Earnings: Bullish or Bearish?By:Mike ButlerNvidia's biggest hurdle may be its rivals, not the company itselfNvidia has been one of the strongest beneficiaries from the artificial intelligence boom.NVDA stock recently reached a high of $974 on Mar. 8, but is trading $100 lower.Nvidia is set to report earnings in late MayNvidia (NVDA) has become a household name over the past year, with the artificial intelligence boom benefiting many tech stocks. Graphics processing units, or GPUs, are in top demand these days, and Nvidia is a key producer of said computer chips.While Nvidia is a key cog in the AI revolution, there are other companies like Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) that are nipping at the heels of the tech giant with innovative products and services that are highly competitive.Stock more than doubled in a yearLooking at a chart of NVDA stock performance, see that even though it's down $100 from the recent high of $974 realized in March, that recent decline doesn't tell the whole story. The stock has more than doubled from a year ago, and it is up over 76% for the year to date.With substantially more bullish days compared to bearish days, the stock has surged higher with no real ceiling in sight.One concern for the tech giant may be the overall economy and the turbulence around interest rate cuts, or lack thereof. Just a few days ago, the probability of an interest rate cut in June was around 50%. Now, that probability has dropped to just 20% after a hot CPI report on Tuesday, April 9.When investors have a high risk-free rate of return with an elevated interest rate, there's less of a reason to take risk in the stock market. When interest rates are cut, there is more incentive to participate in the stock market. Experts expect interest rate cuts this year. It wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia be one of the main beneficiaries of a rate cut, risk-on environment.Options offer contextRegardless of opinion, we can always look to the options market to get a contextual sense of stock price expectations for certain periods.Nvidia is set to report earnings within the May 24 options cycle, as we can see with the big implied volatility boost in that weekly cycle with 43 days to expiration from today. The expected stock price move for that cycle is currently +-$131.65, which is almost 10% of the stock price. This is on the higher end of the range, as we typically see earnings-move estimations fall between 5-10% of the stock price.The upcoming earnings announcement makes up about 50% of the expected move for the rest of the year, which is currently at +-$261.91 in the Dec 2024 options cycle.Bullish on Nvidia in 2024Looking at the tastytrade research & news tab, we can see news, fundamentals, ratios, and forecasts for Nvidia. Of 53 analysis predictions for the stock, 49 of them have a strong buy or buy rating. None of these analysts have a sell or strong sell rating, which tells us everything we need to know - the market & social sentiment around NVDA stock is extremely bullish.Nvidia already plays a huge role in the AI revolution, and the company has such a large market cap now it's hard to imagine a world where they're overtaken by a rival. Nvidia bulls in 2024 will likely want to see more reliance from big-name tech stocks, more innovation from the NVDA product suite, and consistent outperformance for each of the earnings calls this year. Nvidia has exceeded earnings-per-share (EPS) and revenue estimates for each of the past four earnings calls by almost double-digit percentages every time, and these estimates have skyrocketed each earnings call.Bearish on Nvidia in 2024Nvidia bears likely believe that the company is overbought, and that the competitive landscape for chip demand may be more balanced than the market is telling us right now. Heightened earnings expectations also mean there is less wiggle room for an earnings miss, and earnings misses are rarely seen as bullish stock price indicators in a stock with such a large market cap.We can't forget about the overall economy either - when the hot CPI report came out on Tuesday, we saw almost the entire market sell off. Individual equities still have their weaknesses, and a turbulent economy may create a tough environment for tech, which has already seen such massive movements to the upside the past year. This could result in profit taking, which can create downside pressure on a stock that's performed well already.Regardless of how you look at it, 2024 will be an interesting year for tech stocks, specifically big gainers like Nvidia.Tune in to Options Trading Concepts Live ahead of the Nvidia earnings announcement in May for options trading strategy ideas!Mike Butler, tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

Today, only two of those companies -- Apple and Alphabet -- remain in the top four. Berkshire Hathaway has slipped to No. 7, and ExxonMobil and Walmart have fallen from the top 10 altogether. A lot can change in only 11 years. Let's look at the companies I believe will claim the top four spots in 2035.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia By 2035, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will be the world's largest company by market cap. What's more, I think it could happen even sooner. One reason is that Nvidia has already grown faster than nearly anyone expected. The company's market cap has exploded almost 10x, from $0.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion in less than two years.   NVDA Market Cap data by YCharts.   The massive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is behind the company's rapid rise. Thanks to its leading position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, Nvidia is well-positioned to take the crown as the largest company by 2035 -- if not sooner. That's because the GPU market is expected to grow by leaps and bounds over the next decade. According to Global Markets Insights, the size of the GPU market is set to expand from $40 billion in 2022 to $400 billion by 2032.   What's more, the ramp in GPU spending is already here. Nvidia's sales increased by a mind-blowing 265% year over year in its most recent quarter (the three months ending Jan. 28, 2024). While sales are expected to cool somewhat, analysts still expect the company to grow them by 82% this year.  Over the next five years, given the explosive growth of the overall GPU market, analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 37% per year, meaning the company's annual revenue by 2030 could approach $300 billion. In short, Nvidia is riding a tsunami of growth that could carry it all the way to the top spot by 2035. Microsoft With a market cap of $3.2 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's largest company, having passed Apple last year. Like Nvidia, the AI revolution has lifted Microsoft's market cap significantly. The company's extensive and iconic software suite offers a natural home for AI-powered tools, and it has wasted no time integrating AI features into its software. What's more, Microsoft enjoys a close partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. That partnership has already helped both companies and puts Microsoft in a good spot to benefit from future AI breakthroughs that OpenAI may make. AI will likely be the key factor in driving market caps higher over the next decade, and Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on that trend.    Story Continues In terms of growth, analysts expect Microsoft to grow sales by 16% per year over the next five years, implying annual sales of over $475 billion by 2030. That's nearly in line with an internal target set by chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadella of $500 billion in revenue by 2030. Either way, Microsoft's expected growth shows that the company has staying power, and while the company may not be able to stay ahead of Nvidia, it will likely keep its lead over everyone else.AmazonWith a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is currently America's fifth-largest company. But by 2035, I see it leapfrogging a number of companies, including Apple and Alphabet, to take the third spot.That's because Amazon, like Nvidia and Microsoft before it, has a natural way to benefit from the AI revolution. The company already utilizes more than 750,000 robots in its sprawling warehouses. They measure and pack products, move heavy items, read labels, and distribute shelves and packages.In addition, AI should help the company improve the digital side of its e-commerce business. AI assistants can shop for customers and help with returns. AI-powered ad tools can refine which customers see which ads, leading to improved return on investment (ROI) and generating more ad revenue for Amazon. Moreover, the company's crown jewel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), should continue to benefit from the transition to the cloud over the next decade.Amazon is already one of the largest companies by revenue; the company has generated $575 billion over the last 12 months -- second only to Walmart's $648 billion. However, Amazon is closing the gap quickly and should overtake Walmart soon. Analysts expect Amazon to grow its revenue by 31% per year over the next five years, bringing annual revenue to an eye-popping $2.2 trillion by 2030.Thanks to its impressive revenue growth, I think Amazon will climb the rankings up to third place.Meta PlatformsRounding out the top four is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Currently the sixth-largest American company by market cap, I expect Meta to leapfrog both Alphabet and Apple by 2035.Meta is quickly becoming one of the world's biggest cash cows. The company's lucrative ad business continues to grow by leaps and bounds as the digital advertising market expands. Moreover, Meta's ambitious AI research and development could lead to revolutionary breakthroughs over the next decade. In terms of revenue, analysts expect Meta to grow revenue by 26% annually over the next five years, leading to an annual total of $429 billion by 2030.At any rate, with its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) providing ample free cash flow, Meta is well-positioned to grow its market cap significantly over the next decade, so it could surpass laggards like Alphabet and Apple by 2035.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

It refers to stocks that increase 10 times in value, generating 1,000% returns for early investors. In his investing bible, \u201cOne Up on Wall Street,\u201d Lynch revealed his methodology for identifying these massive winners early. \nSo what should investors look for in potential tenbagger Peter Lynch stocks?\nFirst, reasonable valuation. Lynch sought stocks trading at P/E ratios below the industry average and their own 5-year average. Next, strong fundamentals like over 20% revenue and earnings growth. Also critical \u2013 being underfollowed and undiscovered, so investors can get in early before the herd. Finally, patience to hold these winners for years as they realize their full potential. \nFinding the next 10X stock is challenging. However, diversification across a basket of stocks means investors can significantly boost their odds. Let\u2019s explore three Peter Lynch stocks demonstrating these attributes and positioned to multiply investment 10X this decade.\n\t\t\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations, emerging as a trailblazer in accelerated computing, catalyzing transformative innovations in AI, data center platforms, gaming, automation, and beyond. \nIn its recent Q4 2024 earnings, Nvidia revealed record quarterly revenue, up 22% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) to $22.1 billion. For FY2024, NVDA achieved $60.9 billion in total revenue, a 126% surge from the previous year. With data center revenue specifically skyrocketing 217% to $47.5 billion in 2024, Nvidia has immense growth potential.\nAlso, the company has cemented powerful partnerships with top tech firms to propel its data center and AI platforms. For example, some deals include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). Furthermore, between its Nvidia Omniverse simulation technologies powering industries from automotive to healthcare and its booming GeForce RTX gaming ecosystem with over 100 million users, NVDA is innovating on all fronts.\nWhile the stock might be currently overvalued, it still has excellent potential. This is particularly true in the event of any headwinds that could cause temporary corrections or a recession. With robust revenue streams fueling heavy research and development (R&D) investments over $1 billion in 2024 alone, Nvidia can overcome any setbacks. \nWarrior Met Coal (HCC)\nSource: ShutterstockMohnish Pabrai added a total of one stock to his portfolio this quarter (Q4 2023) \u2013 Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC). Pabrai bought 629,712 shares, accounting for 15.47% of the portfolio and a total value of $38.39 million.\n\t\t\n\n\nWhy should investors care? Well, Pabrai\u2019s investment philosophy is deeply rooted in value investing. He often targets Peter Lynch stocks with a market cap around the half-billion-dollar range currently out of favor. \nHCC stands poised to be a Peter Lynch-style multi-bagger over the next decade. The company achieved record financial results in 2023. Thus, its net income came in at $478.6 million and adjusted EBITDA was $698.9 million. Also, sales and production volumes grew substantially, by 34% and 21% respectively, compared to 2022.\nFurther, the company is investing heavily in the large-scale Blue Creek growth project, funding it entirely from strong operational cash flows. The endeavor will add 4.8 million tons per year of premium metallurgical coal production starting in 2026. \nWith coal demand growing amid tight supply, Warrior Met Coal\u2019s solid operational excellence and world-class expansion plans make it a compelling Peter Lynch-style pick. Therefore, Mohnish Pabrai\u2019s large new stake signals the stock\u2019s attractive upside potential to multiply an investment ten times or more over the next decade. \nEvolution AB (EVVTY)\nEvolution AB (OTCMKTS:EVVTY) is riding the crest of a megatrend in online gambling \u2013 Live Casino. \n\t\t\n\n\nAs the leading B2B provider globally over 600 operators as customers, this Swedish innovator has built a scalable platform. And, its comprehensive suite of industry-leading solutions earned them Live Casino Supplier of the Year for 10 years straight.\nClearly, the numbers speak for themselves, with Evolution seeing a 48% revenue CAGR from 2015 to 2019. Most recently, Q4 2023 saw the company achieve a 16.65% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth to 475.31 million EUR. Also, it saw a 26.56% jump in net income to 282.86 million EUR. \nLooking ahead, the company is doubling down on U.S. expansion via a new strategic agreement with Caesars Digital. Clearly, Evolution\u2019s proven business model and established leadership status signal a company in growth mode. \nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk held long positions in GOOGL, AMZN.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Vineer Bhansali is the Founder and CIO of LongTail Alpha, LLCFollow AuthorApr 02, 2024, 10:49am EDTShareSaveCommentIn a piece I published last week in this forum (here) I mentioned how the availability of explicit leverage to some, but not to all, has frequently resulted in the tendency for all participants to move off an optimal portfolio into increasingly risky securities. My conclusion was that similar to the dynamics of pre-global financial crisis speculation in implicitly levered \u201csynthetic asset-backed securities\u201d, as well as the pre-XIV-meltdown dynamic (XIV was the inverse volatility ETF which erased all of its value in roughly a day in 2018 in an event known as \u201cvolmageddon\u201d) in 2017, we might be in another period of deleveraging driven meltdown; this time arising from explicitly and implicitly levered positions in name stocks such as NVDA, and many others.\nA smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nTo be sure I do think that the AI revolution is more real this time than in past eras and NVDA is at the forefront of this round; NVDA is the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d provider with pricing power this time. I am a big admirer of the company. But the stock and its legions of fanatics tempted with the ability to lever is another matter. The impact of leverage and market dynamics on price and feedback loops on stock prices cannot be ignored. I have no idea if the fair value for this stock is $200 or $2000 (current price about $900 \u2013 Source: Bloomberg). But what I would like to highlight is just like the two other episodes mentioned above, the massive retail inflow into NVDA both through short-dated call options and levered ETFs is providing both explicit and implicit leverage to investors who have wholeheartedly taken advantage of it. And this leverage is primed to unwind, possibly dragging bystanders in index funds with it.\n\nETFs were designed to provide the exposure to a broad index of a given market in a compact, easy to trade, simple to understand, tax efficient, diversified basket of un-levered securities for investors. However, the regulations surrounding ETFs did not anticipate that these same vehicles would someday be used to provide un-diversified, levered, hard-to-analyze, tax-inefficient short term trading vehicles that can be marketed and sold to unsuspecting retail investors. Single-name ETFs take a single stock and package them into an ETF. So far, so good, but no one would buy unlevered single-stock ETF since they would be better off buying the stock itself. Enter leverage. Levered single stock ETFs provide investors with levered long or short holdings on a completely undiversified single name - typically a high-flying story stock like NVDA in today\u2019s market. For retail investors who notoriously chase recent performance, these vehicles act like a magnet. For a discussion of the risks of single name stock ETFs please see the discussion from the SEC Market Structure Subcommittee of the SEC Investor Advisory Committee (here). It is clear to anyone who studies the risks of levered single stock ETFs that they are not a safe \u201cinvestment\u201d \u2013 they are only good as trading vehicles for short term trading, and even then by experts. According to the note from the SEC committee referenced above, 92% of the holders are retail investors who \u201cdo not understand the potential effects of compounding and daily rebalancing of the 2.0x or 3.0x leveraged or inverse ETFs on the daily returns of a stock, such that the performance significantly diverges from the underlying stock when held over a longer period of time\u201d. In addition: \u201cAs multiple panelists noted, single stock ETFs are inconsistent with the original spirit of the exemptive relief for traditional ETFs, which offered investors a lower cost and transparent way to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. In contrast to basic traditional ETFs, single stock ETFs are expensive, complex, opaque (due to their reliance on derivatives), and not diversified.\u201d The main solution from the panel of the investor advisory committee, while they seemed to agree that such single stock ETFS might be \u201crunning afoul of the general spirit of ETFs\u201d was\u2026to come up with a better naming convention.\n\n\nWhen I googled levered and single name ETFs that use Nvidia stock as the underlying holding, I found the following (non-exhaustive list): NVDL (2x levered), NVD2 (2x), NVD3 (3x), 3LNV (3x), NVDU (1.5x) \u2013 and I am missing some others, I am sure of it. The largest levered NVDA single name ETF is NVDL, with assets of over $2 billion and massive inflows this year. As NVDA stock has surged, this ETF has had a return for the year of over 175% (as of March 31, 2024), and a one-year return of 488% (source: Bloomberg). NVDL has seen its market cap increase by almost ten-fold in just the last three months. Because of the leverage and the volatility of the stock itself, the ETF has a realized 30-day volatility of 120%. In other words, this ETF acts as a lottery ticket betting on further gains for NVDA, but with a good chance that in a large enough shock (around 50% shock to NVDA stock), it would lose 100% of its value! Yes, it can happen - just go back and look at charts of XIV and its cousins.\n\nThe leverage in some of the ETFs (such as NVDL) Is through total return swaps (TRS), where the investor receives the performance from a dealer using a swap (in exchange the ETF provider pays an interest expense plus a spread normally indexed to some interest rate like SOFR); or in another version (such as NVD2), the ETF provider borrows money on margin to buy 2x or 3x the NVDA stock. Remember, the provider of the ETF (i.e. the manufacturer of the crack, to take my analogy further) is almost never at risk; it simply provides the retail investor with the performance of the levered ETF for a price (approximately 0.75% to 1.5% depending on the ETF), and itself buys the underlying stock to make sure its is holding a mirror image of what it is selling the ultimate buyer. The more the retail investor buys, the more the ETF provider is happy to oblige \u2013 why? Because it takes the money from the investor and buys the stock, regardless of the stock\u2019s price, and charges its fees on an ever increasing asset base \u2013 so if the provider earns $2 million in fees for an ETF that is $200 million in size, it earns almost $20 million in fees when the ETF is $2 billion. But the act of replication of the ETF is the same \u2013 add an extra zero to the swap \u201cnotional\u201d value and increase your fees by 10x. If the stock goes down sharply, a levered ETF can get wiped out (again recall what happened to XIV in a day!), and the ETF provider can just shut down trading, or redeem out the shareholders, or, in many cases can just convert the ETF to a closed end fund whose net asset value can be very different from the stock price (see for example that the largest bitcoin fund, GBTC, which owns only bitcoin, traded at close to 40% discount to the value of its only holding, bitcoin, when it was a closed-end fund). In other words, the ETF provider is just a middleman, an agent, whose main goal is to (1) make fees for providing leverage, (2) take little to no market risk itself, (3) programmatically do what its prospectus says it will do (how many retail investors read and understand the prospectus of a levered ETF is left to guesswork, but if it\u2019s like the fine print of any other document, it\u2019s probably very few). The providers of levered ETFs are \u201cdealers\u201d of this highly intoxicating legal financial drug, and to be very clear, what they are doing is entirely legal at the time of this writing, and I cannot really blame them for providing what retail investors want. As a matter of fact when I searched for who the holders of one of these ETFs (NVDL) is, the names that showed up were a little bit surprising: amongst the largest holders there was, surprisingly, one sovereign wealth fund, a number of brokerage shops, and of course some authorized participants and market makers (they might have already unloaded their holdings so I have no idea if they are still large owners). In other words, since the levered ETFs are made to be used as short-term trading vehicles, the long-term holders are predominantly providers of inventory who can provide the levered ETFs on demand to day-traders for of course, a fee, and transactions spreads. Markets live on, with producers providing consumers with what they want for a healthy, almost risk-free profit.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nWhat does concern me, however, is the potential for systemic risk and its impact on markets broadly. As in 2006, when similar simple observations foresaw the melt-down of the credit markets, and in 2018, when our analysis anticipated the melt-up in the volatility markets, this time the risk is bigger, and potentially more systemic. The reason is that NVDA is held in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices, which form the backbone of trillions of dollars of assets globally, since they are the most important equity indices for portfolios worldwide. Since NVDA is almost 5% by weight of the S&P as of this writing, every new dollar of money that comes into the S&P 500 via active and passive funds, ETFs, and even derivatives markets, has to mechanically put 5% into NVDA. The higher the price of NVDA goes, the more dollars that have to go into NVDA. In other words, even passive investors who definitely would not otherwise buy the stock are probably buying a lot more than they think they are. Those who can explicitly lever are forcing those who do not want to lever to do the same. It\u2019s like inhaling second-hand smoke. At the time of this writing only Microsoft\nMSFT\n and Apple\nAAPL\n are larger percentage components of the S&P 500, but the levered ETFs on them have been duds. The same provider whose 2x levered NVDA ETF has over $2 billion in AUM has only one million in the 2x levered Microsoft ETF and only $20 million in the 2x levered Apple ETF. Speculating on Microsoft and Apple is just not exciting enough, I guess, since even Warren Buffett owns them.\n\nSo what is likely to happen next?\nIf my analysis of the situation is correct, not only NVDA stock, but the levered ETFs, and by extension the market indices are highly vulnerable to a deleveraging episode. Hopefully it will be a short one. Note that when interest rates are at current levels (above 5%), leverage costs at least that much, and possibly more. Rates today are definitely not low, so the availability of leverage is mostly a function of rising value of the levered asset. If for some reason the market\u2019s recent romance with an imminent rate cut from the Fed dissipates and rates rise further, leverage would certainly cost even more. Which means that looking out (1) this ability to lever up a high flying, highly volatile stock cheaply has to continue to exist, (2) the price of the stock has to keep going faster than interest rates for the foreseeable future, (3) passive indices and investors have to keep plowing money into the ETFs and funds that track the market indices that hold NVDA. If any of these pre-conditions is violated then the stock can hit an air pocket, and drag down the indices with it as a vicious reverse cycle of redemption starts. In that world, so-called diversified market indices will not behave very diversified. And the risk of contagion from selling can drive the price of other securities beyond fundamental value. In other words, systemic risk can re-emerge in all its ugliness.\n\n\nFor investors who have seen this game play out before, today is the time to take some risk off the table and build protection in portfolios. The presence of leverage in some single name ETFs that hold stocks that are a big part of the indices creates the perfect conditions for a systemic shock that can be hedged relatively inexpensively today. As for buyers who buy single stock ETFs just because of recent eye-popping returns, I think Joel Greenblatt\u2019s warning is relevant: \u201cChoosing individual stocks without any idea of what you are looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you\u2019re still an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

CEO Elon Musk ridiculed the sharp 10% decline in Nvidia Corp.'s NVDA stock and its subsequent $211 billion market capitalization loss on Friday.\nWhat Happened: Musk took to X, formerly Twitter, on Friday to mock the substantial decline in Nvidia's market capitalization. He referred to the 10% decline as \u201crookie numbers.\"\n\nRookie numbers\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 20, 2024\n\nOn Friday, Nvidia\u2019s stock took a significant hit, resulting in a $211 billion loss in market capitalization. This was the second-largest single-day loss in the history of the U.S. stock market.\nSee Also: Tesla\u2019s Autonomous Driving Efforts Win Praise From Goldman Sachs\nOverall, the Magnificent 7 group of stocks, which includes Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Tesla and Nvidia together witnessed a record $950 billion loss of market capitalization in the last week, according to MarketWatch.\nSubscribe to the\u00a0Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter\u00a0to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\nWhy It Matters: The decline in Nvidia\u2019s stock value has had a significant impact on the market.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index experienced its worst day since late 2023, and the worst week since late 2022, with a 2.1% drop on Friday. This marked the fourth consecutive week of declines, a negative streak not seen since May 2022.\nOn a weekly basis, the Nasdaq 100, which is closely tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, tumbled 5.3%, marking its worst performance since October 2022. The downturn on Friday further exacerbated the already pessimistic sentiment surrounding U.S. tech stocks.\nNvidia\u2019s stock decline was attributed to a series of events, including worse-than-expected earnings from ASML Holdings N.V. ASML and a reduced outlook for the chip market by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM.\nDespite the stock decline, TSM\u2019s revenue surged 16.5% to $18.87 billion, surpassing the Street consensus estimate of $18.40 billion. This was attributed to robust demand from artificial intelligence firms.\nOther companies in the semiconductor sector, such as Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI, also experienced stock declines on Friday, further adding to the overall negative sentiment in the market.\nCheck out more of Benzinga\u2019s Consumer Tech coverage by\u00a0following this link.\nRead Next: Think Trading In Your iPhone Helps Keep Planet Green?

Analysts are focused on the $80 per share fall on April 19, it\u2019s now trading 14% below where it was a month ago, when it peaked at $950/share. You could get in early on April 23 below $825.\nBut Nvidia stock is still not cheap. The market cap at the current price is $2 trillion. You\u2019re still paying 66 times earnings and 33 times sales for a chip stock. Those are very high prices. A better question is, if you\u2019ve been in it five years like I have, is it time to take profits? After all, you don\u2019t have a profit until you sell and put money in your pocket.\nSell the Rebound on Nvidia Stock ?\nAll booms bust. This will be true for artificial intelligence as it was for the internet.\u00a0\nMonopolies also end. Nvidia currently has 97% of the data center market for graphics processing units, the number-crunching chips that are its specialty. That\u2019s thanks to its software, like Cuda, a full stack of tools for building AI applications.\nNvidia made a quick bounce off its lows, recouping about one-third of its most recent fall in a few days. But the whole semiconductor complex has fallen out of bed. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have fallen hard lately.\nVeteran Nvidia analysts aren\u2019t worried. Some are even reiterating their outperform ratings.\nAI Performance\nA better question is why worry about AI stocks at all?\nToday\u2019s concerns are all about falling interest in consumer AI applications , which seem like games. Some of the potential uses are truly creepy. \nBut that\u2019s not the market. The early stages of the AI boom are all about vertical applications, built on internal data sets with defined outputs. \nIt\u2019s about AI assistants. These applications are showing real value, in the form of increased productivity. Enterprise buyers are hungry for more. AI tools have become a C-Suite obsession.\nThe market is still booming.\nWhere We Are With AI\nWe are well past the \u201cgee whiz\u201d stage of AI, although gee whiz applications are being written up every day.\nAI is now where the internet was in about 1997. That\u2019s when I first warned of a dot-com bubble and people started worrying about the Web\u2019s implications. We\u2019re not at 2000, when the bubble truly burst.\nThe most relevant worry for Nvidia is the energy use of its chips, which threatens to overwhelm the grid. This is something Cloud Czars like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dealt with two decades ago, recycling their heat and adding back-up power. \nThe trouble is this problem is no longer confined to cloud data centers.\nJoe McKendrick, one of my favorite tech analysts, has it right in saying that, over time, AI fades into the background. \nWe no longer think about e-commerce, it\u2019s commerce. We no longer think about the mobile web. It\u2019s the Web. The same will be true for AI. It will be absorbed into what already exists.\nIt\u2019s in getting there that the money will be made.\nNot just by Nvidia, either.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe AI market isn\u2019t exactly like the internet market.\nThe internet was a consumer-first market. Everyone could use the early internet, and that was part of its charm.\nAI applications are expensive to make. Right now, they\u2019re best done for niches. This realization is behind the current market disillusionment. But the future of AI is so bright you do need shades.\nNvidia isn\u2019t going anywhere. But it is more than fairly valued here. You can buy this dip and then you can sell the bounce.\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in, NVDA, TSM, INTC, and GOOGL.

However, as the leader expands the market TAM, the junior can likely continue to carve a profitable niche,\" Arya said.\u00a0\nThere are three \"Buy\" rated stocks that Arya believes will benefit from the growing adoption of AI.\n\n\n1. Marvell Technology\nMarvell Technology offers data infrastructure-focused semiconductor solutions and helps tech companies build custom chips. The company should offer more details about its AI strategy at its upcoming analyst day on April 11.\nArya thinks the analyst day will be a positive catalyst for the stock, as he expects the company will guide for about 10% long-term share of the $20 to $30 billion custom AI chip market, which would be well above consensus estimates of less than 5% share.\nArya said Micron could also highlight its AI Ethernet switching business, which is a market that could double to as much as $7 billion by 2027. Marvell currently has a 5% share in the market.\u00a0\n\n\n\"MRVL's execution has been spotty the last few quarters but our recent meeting suggests potential for legacy roughing near-term,\" Arya said.\nBank of America reiterated its $95 price target, representing potential upside of 30%.\n2. Micron\nHigh-bandwidth memory is essential for the growing adoption of AI, and it's creating a dynamic that has never happened in the memory market. That's great news for memory-chip producer Micron.\n\n\n\"Usually new memory demand cycles are met with a supply response, leading inevitably to inventory and price pressure. High-bandwidth memory, critical to AI, is perhaps the first memory technology that is rapidly eating into the supply, consuming 3x the amount of wafer vs. traditional DDR DRAM memory,\" Arya said.\nArya estimated that the high-bandwidth memory market will grow at a 48% compounded annual growth rate through 2027 to more than $20 billion.\u00a0\n\"Memory industry also stands to benefit as AI expands to the edge, via higher-spec'd smartphones, PCs and other smart/connected devices,\" Arya said.\n\n\nBank of America raised Micron's price target to $144 from $120, representing potential upside of 15%.\n3. AMD\nAMD's consistency in execution gives Arya confidence that it can maintain a 5% to 10% share in the AI accelerator market that Nvidia dominates.\n\"This is lower than the 20% share opportunity some bulls would argue for, but we argue AMD is being flanked on 3 sides - from leader NVDA with its incumbency/scale and well-priced Blackwell products, from custom chips with their lower-price/higher optimization, and from multiple start-ups going after market niches,\" Arya said.\n\n\nStill, while AMD is playing catch up in the AI market, \"we expect it to leverage its chiplet architecture to move faster to the 3nm node for CY26 AI products,\" Arya said.\nBank of America reiterated its $195 price target, representing potential upside of 7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nMarkets\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nAnalyst Note\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

After all, if a stock doubles or triples, people don't want to see those gains disappear. And it can be gut-wrenching to watch a stock you own seemingly drop day after day.\nBut having the fortitude to hold the stocks of great companies over the long term is the way to let your investments grow and generate what can be life-changing returns. Leading technology company Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) is a case in point.\nWhat will Nvidia stock be worth in 2025?\nBefore looking at where Nvidia might go from here, consider the path the stock has taken over the past five years. The company spent years developing the computing power hardware and related software needed for cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Now that it is monetizing that research and development, investors who held shares along the way have been rewarded handsomely.\nConsider that if you had invested $2,500 in Nvidia just five years ago, those shares would now be worth $44,900. But one had to have a strong stomach to see those gains. Much of that massive return was realized over the last 18 months. \n\nThe average 78% annual return trounces the approximately 10% total annual return of the S&P 500 index over the past 95 years. But it wasn't an easy road to achieve that return. There were several periods in those five years when Nvidia shares plunged by more than 25% from the previous high. That included a massive 65% plunge that occurred during 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nBut Nvidia's powerful computing chips and software are in high demand now. That's led to an exponential jump in revenue and earnings. No one knows where Nvidia stock will be in 2025. But long-term investors shouldn't worry about that. As long as the company continues to innovate, the stock deserves a place in any diversified portfolio.\n\n\n\nHoward Smith has positions in Nvidia.

Here's What Investors Need to Know\n\n\n  \n      By Adam Spatacco\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Apr 2, 2024 at 4:15AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoice-recognition is an area of artificial intelligence (AI) that has garnered interest from some of the world's largest technology enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is an investor in SoundHound AI, which works with leading companies across the automobile, restaurant, and Internet-of-Things segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-1.69%)\u00a0-$2.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.50\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, investors learned that Nvidia is a small investor in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI.\n\nEuphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling the capital markets. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are hovering near record levels as megacap tech companies continue to benefit from AI tailwinds.\nAt the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative is chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%). Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data-center services is off the charts. As a result, Nvidia's revenue and profits are accelerating at unprecedented levels.\nThe company is investing in several different areas of AI, and one in particular is garnering a lot of attention. Nvidia is an investor in speech-recognition platform SoundHound AI (SOUN -3.97%).\nLet's dig into this partnership and learn why voice-recognition software is on Nvidia's radar. More importantly, let's assess the opportunities to invest in this budding area of the AI realm.\n\nVoice-recognition is a huge market\nYou may not realize it, but there's a pretty good chance that you interact with voice-recognition software on a daily basis. Apple has integrated the technology across its hardware devices through Siri. Moreover, both Amazon and Alphabet leverage speech AI applications across their respective lines of smart home appliances.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket research suggests that by next decade the market size for voice-recognition technology could reach $50 billion. Given its big-tech peers already have an established presence in the AI-powered voice market, coupled with the technology's growth potential, it's not surprising to see Nvidia enter the scene.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's investment spurred a lot of interest\nInvestors learned that Nvidia is an investor in SoundHound AI earlier this year, following a 13F filing by the chipmaker. This caused SoundHound AI stock to surge -- with shares rising from penny-stock levels to as high as $8.91 per share.\nWhile this was fun to witness, details surrounding Nvidia's relationship with SoundHound AI were sparse. But following Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in late March, investors finally learned a bit more about the partnership.\nNvidia's Drive infrastructure helps car manufacturers collect data loads that are needed to refine autonomous-driving technology. Given SoundHound AI's existing portfolio of work with Stellantis, Hyundai, Kia, and Honda, there is some obvious overlap between the company and Nvidia's technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoundHound AI will be offering a voice assistant that runs on Nvidia's Drive for its automobile customers. This is a unique generative AI feature that provides drivers the ability to ask questions related to maintenance, safety, car settings, among other things.\nInvestors should assess different opportunities\nSoundHound AI's partnership with Nvidia is exciting. But the company needs to prove that the relationship with Nvidia can be translated into tangible growth. Given the abnormal surge in the stock, I'd caution investors from buying SoundHound AI stock at its current valuation.\nMoreover, SoundHound AI is far from the only company leveraging Nvidia Drive. During GTC, investors learned that Li Auto, Nio, Lenovo, and others are implementing Drive and other sibling AI services developed by Nvidia.\nWhile Nvidia is best known for its chip business, the company is proving that it can disrupt areas beyond AI-powered hardware. I see the investment in SoundHound AI as one of many opportunities Nvidia is exploring to generate growth in its under-the-radar software business, all while playing an integral role in autonomous driving, which very well may be the next frontier of the automobile industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile SoundHound AI may appear as a lucrative opportunity, the company still has a lot to prove. By contrast, I think Nvidia is the engine powering myriad applications in the AI realm right now. For this reason, I see the stock as a compelling choice for long-term investors.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Shares of Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) are down 10% from the all-time high they hit at the end of last month. Although the stock is still up 76% year-to-date, an incredible run after last year\u2019s phenomenal high, investors are right to question whether this is the point where the AI chipmaker\u2019s rocket begins to stall.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a problem with Nvidia stock itself. The market as a whole is having a tougher time in April. All the major stock indexes are lower over the past three weeks as inflation picks up steam again. It raises doubts about when (or if) the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Fed chairman Jay Powell just intoned, \u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\u201d Analysts now say don\u2019t expect a rate cut until December at the earliest.\nThat could be tough on business spending. They may begin reining in previous plans for expansion. How that impacts plans for AI\u2019s growth going forward remains to be seen but it\u2019s easy to see why investors may be concerned about Nvidia stock.\nFull speed ahead\nInvestors need to separate Nvidia\u2019s business from its stock. The chipmaker\u2019s business is fine. As CEO Jensen Huang told analysts, all aspects of its business \u201care all growth engines in full throttle.\u201d The CFO also said the AI wave is just beginning to sweep over the enterprise market, which is why the interest rate environment is key.\nEarnings season for the second quarter is just getting under way. Keeping an eye on how those reports come in will be a signal as to whether growth will continue. Yet we also need to be mindful that a lot of this chip inventory has already been spoken for.\nMicron Technology (NYSE:MU), which is making high-bandwidth memory for data centers to help meet their AI needs, says all of its 2024 inventory is already sold and most of 2025\u2019s is gone too. Nvidia is undoubtedly in a similar situation. Any slowdown that occurs likely won\u2019t appear for many months down the road. Orders can be cancelled, of course, but those are the sorts of warnings we\u2019ll be alerted to as the year progresses should they even materialize.\nAn increasingly crowded field\nYet investors can\u2019t ignore Nvidia\u2019s valuation. When the market was all agog with growth, Nvidia stock trading at 70 times earnings and 30 times sales was acceptable. But with the Fed actively trying to throw the economy into reverse such lofty valuations might not set well.\nNvidia is facing increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), both of which recently introduced new, more powerful AI chips of their own. Even Nvidia\u2019s own customers don\u2019t want to be so reliant upon the chipmaker for the AI semiconductor needs.\nAlphabet\u2018s (NASDAQ:GOOG), NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently developed the Axion chip, which it maintains is not a competitor to Nvidia and only seeks to grow \u201cthe size of the pie.\u201dAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently built its Trainium and Inferentia chips, though the e-commerce giant also extended its partnership with Nvidia. Amazon Web Services was the first outfit to run the chipmaker\u2019s GH200 Grace Hopper multi-chip product.\u00a0However, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also developed its own AI chip. The need for quite so many Nvidia chips might not be as pressing.\nPrepare for the worst, hope for the best\nThe immediate future for Nvidia stock still looks quite hopeful, despite macroeconomic concerns and more competition. It\u2019s going to take a while for those factors to catchup with the semiconductor stock\u2019s massive lead in the space..\nStill, investors should probably begin thinking about the inevitable. No stock can grow to infinity. Although Nvidia stock has looked like it could for some time, these pressures that are only starting to percolate from below may bubble to the surface. And at NVDA stock\u2019s lofty valuations looking for a soft landing pad may not be a bad idea.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If, on the other hand, it\u2019s to develop that thought into \"Hey, I want this in games right now,\" it\u2019s going to take more than a slightly stilted natter with an aspiring bartender.\n\nACE, if you haven\u2019t caught its previous showings on the tech/games trade show circuit, is an all-in-one \u201cfoundry\u201d of AI-powered character creation tools \u2013 language models, speech, text-to-speech, automated mouth flapping and so on \u2013 that Nvidia is pitching as the future of NPC interaction. Plugged into the third-party Inworld Engine, which seems to handle the bulk of the actual AI generation, ACE aims to replace pre-written and recorded character dialogue with more dynamic lines that can respond accurately to any questions or statement you can mutter into a microphone.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE | NVIDIA x Inworld AI - Pushing the Boundaries of Game Characters in Covert Protocol\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube\nCovert Protocol wraps all that up into a short social investigation game, tasking you \u2013 a private detective \u2013 with schmoozing/lying your way into a fancy hotel\u2019s private suites. First up for an AI-assisted interrogation was cheery bellboy Tae Hyun, and first among a gathering of journos to hit the mic, it turned out, was me.\nThe conversation started, as most of mine do, awkwardly. Once I\u2019d gone full Obsidian RPG protagonist mode by asking what the gossip around the hotel was, Tae deflected with a gag about some extraterrestrials checking in. But he could recommend the hotel bar, so I asked in turn about their best cocktail. This was a mistake. As it happened, Tae had designs on taking over the bar himself, and was so proud of his own Baltimore Zoo (with a Korean twist) that he managed to work in a plug for it to several successive responses.\nIt was weird. But it also... worked? As a game interaction, our question and answer session progressed perfectly logically. AI-generated answers were specific to the question, not hedged, and there were no \"Could you repeat that?\" or \"I\u2019m not sure what you mean\" hiccups. Had someone walked in with no knowledge of the machine learning aspect, they might well have just thought ACE was feeding canned lines in response to preplanned queries. So yes, it was neat. A lot of responses even seemed to be taking previous responses into account, using them as context to avoid repetition.\nMostly, anyway. That man was consumed with Baltimore Zoo pride, slipping in endorsements to answers about his political views or his relationship with his mum like he was doing an SNL bit. In fairness, the segues were cheesy, but not entirely non-sequiturs, given I\u2019d broached the subject of drinks to begin with. It\u2019s also possible that this was more of an intentional character tic, of the AI\u2019s making, than a glitch in the Matrix.\n\n\n \nThis guy doesn't seem to love anything, except being a jerk. | Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nStill. I laughed at the time, but in hindsight there was something off about how readily this guy circled back to the exact same topic of his signature tipple. If meant as quirky joke, it was tonally out of whack with the slick detective story presentation, and if it wasn\u2019t, then surely it betrayed how quite literally artificial these 'performances' are. As if ACE was clinging to this character detail like a safety blanket, scared of deviating when it knows it\u2019s got the cocktail thing down, even when doing so makes everything seem more robotic \u2013 not less.\nNot that the masquerade was particularly well-maintained elsewhere. ACE\u2019s AI voices were more naturalistic than those of last year\u2019s ramen shop demo but were still stiff, monotonous, and peppered with strange pauses and pronunciations. All the classic text-to-speech tells, basically. Tae spoke of his family leaving Korea \"for a reason,\" implied to be North Korean aggression, with the same gravity as when he cracked the rubbish joke about aliens. Another of Covert Protocol\u2019s chattable NPCs, a bigshot keynote speaker from whom we needed to extract a room number, reacted with the same non-surprise both to a friendly greeting and to being told his speech was cancelled.\nSome responses also only came after an extended pause, which an Nvidia handler quickly attributed to the venue\u2019s slow Wi-Fi \u2013 so even if this whole system made it into a finished retail game, it would presumably be an always-online affair, relying on your ownership of a high-quality connection to make all these remote queries to Inworld.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE for Games Sparks Life Into Virtual Characters With Generative AI\n\n\n\nACE debuted last year, fronted by this wooden model of a noodle salesman.Watch on YouTube\nThen there\u2019s the writing. Nothing I heard curled my toes like the stinking dialogue of Ubisoft\u2019s NEO NPC demo (even if, worryingly, that's also based on a combination of Inworld and Nvidia tech), but it was also kind of just there. No sparkle, no playfulness, no real weight to the words. I did laugh at Tae\u2019s incessant booze hype but only over the stark ridiculousness of it, not at any of the machine\u2019s more intentional humour. And its attempt at a grizzled private dick-speak voiceover amounted to a tragically bland \"A bar. Could go for an Old Fashioned right about now. But focus, Marcus, focus.\" Nobody Wants to Die, it ain\u2019t.\nI\u2019m still genuinely impressed by the reactivity of the question-and-answering, but as a whole, ACE feels at least a few years away from the point where it might power a game that could pass for human-authored. Thing is, game developers apparently aren\u2019t keen on waiting. Besides Ubisoft, I\u2019m told multiple companies have already approached Nvidia about using ACE to build their NPC casts. That\u2019s not to say we\u2019ll all be jabbering with robots before Christmas, but I do worry that the rush to grasp the benefits of AI \u2013 ideally of the \"properly non-linear social play\" variety and not the \"now we don\u2019t have to pay writers\" variety \u2013 will end with a selection of equally half-baked games.\nI don\u2019t say that as some blanket AI disliker, either. Outside of generative AI, Nvidia themselves have made loads of useful, ethically unproblematic tools that employ machine learning to help players and developers alike. Upscaling darling DLSS, to give the obvious example, or the instant visual upgrades of Ray Reconstruction. Despite producing mods of varying quality, RTX Remix has been a net good so far as well. This actually does use a dash of generative AI to help produce higher-resolution models and textures, but I've never had a problem with these parts of, say, Portal with RTX. A room away from the Covert Protocol demo, I also got a rather promising glimpse of Half-Life 2 RTX in action, showcasing a mix of hand-crafted model and lighting upgrades as well as some AI-generated (but tasteful) texture replacements Correction - Orbifold Studios, the mod team behind HL2 RTX, have also created the 4K textures by hand, rather than use RTX Remix's AI upscaling tools. Good for them!\n\n\n \nHalf-Life 2 RTX gives an old classic the full (if unofficial) remaster treatment, | Image credit: Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nYet there\u2019s clearly a huge gap between having AI perform anti-aliasing, or touch up some brickwork, and going all-in on generative AI to recreate the behaviour of an entire human-ass being in real time. ACE has made progress since the iffy ramen shop visit, but still, I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s ready to jump that chasm quite yet.\nAnd even when it does, will enough players actually want to hear what AI voices have to say? For all the novelty of dynamic dialogue, the desire for emotive, moving, funny, scary, saddening, surprising stories isn\u2019t going anywhere, and if Covert Protocol is any indication, the best ones will still be spun from human hands.\nEven ACE\u2019s own cogs and gears don\u2019t suggest otherwise. Tae Hyun\u2019s mood and speech may be AI-generated, but they have to be generated from something. In this case, it\u2019s a character profile that Inworld Engine keeps for him, with every other NPC having the same: a potted, personal history of their life, loves, dreams, and fears. This is the source of everything that makes Tae interesting, or at the very least, capable of spouting more interesting responses than a British Gas support chatbot, be it his family\u2019s flight from political tension or the formation of a bartending obsession that he now can\u2019t shut up about. And all of it was crafted from scratch \u2013 not by AI, but by a human writer. Just saying.\n\n\n\n\nRead this next\n\n\n\n            New Cities: Skyline 2 update reduces homelessness and makes it easier to track, alongside new difficulty modes\n          \n\n\n\n            Ark: Survival Ascended's first expansion recruits the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen for some flashy, anime cutscenes\n          \n\n\n\n            In Ginger, you speak an unknown language through your keyboard to weave a world\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJames Archer: James had previously hung around beneath the RPS treehouse as a freelancer, before being told to drop the pine cones and climb up to become hardware editor.

This means professionals and creatives will need to tap into increased compute power, regardless of the scale, complexity or scope of their projects.\nTo meet this growing need, NVIDIA is expanding its RTX professional graphics offerings with two new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs for desktops: the NVIDIA RTX A400 and NVIDIA RTX A1000.\nThey expand access to AI and ray-tracing technology, equipping professionals with the tools they need to transform their daily workflows.\nA New Era of Creativity, Performance and Efficiency\nThe RTX A400 GPU introduces accelerated ray tracing and AI to the RTX 400 series GPUs. With 24 Tensor Cores for AI processing, it surpasses traditional CPU-based solutions, enabling professionals to run cutting-edge AI applications, such as intelligent chatbots and copilots, directly on their desktops.\nThe GPU delivers real-time ray tracing so creators can build vivid, physically accurate 3D renders that push the boundaries of creativity and realism.\nThe A400 also includes four display outputs, a first for its series. This makes it ideal for high-density display environments, which are critical for industries like financial services, command and control, retail, and transportation.\n\nThe NVIDIA RTX A1000 GPU brings Tensor Cores and RT Cores to the RTX 1000 series GPUs for the first time, unlocking accelerated AI and ray-tracing performance for creatives and professionals.\nWith 72 Tensor Cores, the A1000 offers a tremendous upgrade over the previous generation, delivering over 3x faster generative AI processing for tools like Stable Diffusion. In addition, its 18 RT Cores speed graphics and rendering tasks by up to 3x, accelerating professional workflows such as 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD), product and architectural design, and 4K video editing.\nThe A1000 also excels in video processing, handling up to 38% more encode streams and offering 2x faster decode performance over the previous generation.\nWith a sleek, single-slot design and consuming just 50W, the A400 and A1000 GPUs bring impressive features to compact, energy-efficient workstations.\n\n\u00a0\nExpanding the Reach of RTX\nThese new GPUs empower users with cutting-edge AI, graphics and compute capabilities to boost productivity and unlock creative possibilities. Advanced workflows involving ray-traced renders and AI are now within reach, allowing professionals to push the boundaries of their work and achieve stunning levels of realism.\nIndustrial planners can use \u200cthese new powerful and energy-efficient computing solutions for edge deployments. Creators can boost editing and rendering speeds to produce richer visual content. Architects and engineers can seamlessly transition ideas from 3D CAD concepts into tangible designs. Teams working in smart spaces can use the GPUs for real-time data processing, AI-enhanced security and digital signage management in space-constrained settings. And healthcare professionals can achieve quicker, more precise medical imaging analyses.\nFinancial professionals have always used expansive, high-resolution visual workspaces for more effective trading, analysis and data management. With the RTX A400 GPU supporting up to four 4K displays natively, financial services users can now achieve a high display density with fewer GPUs, streamlining their setups and reducing costs.\nNext-Generation Features and Accelerated Performance\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA RTX A400 and A1000 GPUs are equipped with features designed to supercharge everyday workflows, including:\n\nSecond-generation RT Cores: Real-time ray tracing, photorealistic, physically based rendering and visualization for all professional workflows, including architectural drafting, 3D design and content creation, where accurate lighting and shadow simulations can greatly enhance the quality of work.\nThird-generation Tensor Cores: Accelerates AI-augmented tools and applications such as generative AI, image rendering denoising and deep learning super sampling to improve image generation speed and quality.\nAmpere architecture-based CUDA cores: Up to 2x the single-precision floating point throughput of the previous generation for significant speedups in graphics and compute workloads.\n4GB or 8GB of GPU memory: 4GB of GPU memory with the A400 GPU and 8GB with the A1000 GPU accommodate a range of professional needs, from basic graphic design and photo editing to more demanding 3D modeling with textures or high-resolution editing and data analyses. The GPUs also feature increased memory bandwidth over the previous generation for quicker data processing and smoother handling of larger datasets and scenes.\nEncode and decode engines: With seventh-generation encode (NVENC) and fifth-generation decode (NVDEC) engines, the GPUs offer efficient video processing to support high-resolution video editing, streaming and playback with ultra-low latency. Inclusion of AV1 decode enables higher efficiency and smoother playback of more video formats.\n\nAvailability\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA RTX A1000 GPU is now available through global distribution partners such as PNY and Ryoyo Electric. The RTX A400 GPU is expected to be available from channel partners starting in May, with anticipated availability from manufacturers in the summer.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | Pro GraphicsTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA RTX | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The initiative \u2014 the AI Makerspace \u2014 is launched in collaboration with\u00a0NVIDIA. College leaders call it a digital sandbox for students to understand and use AI in the classroom.\u00a0Initially focusing on undergraduate students, the AI Makerspace aims to democratize access to computing resources typically reserved for researchers or technology companies. Students will access the cluster online as part of their coursework, deepening their AI skills through hands-on experience. The Makerspace will also better position students after graduation as they work with AI professionals and help shape the technology\u2019s future applications.\u00a0\u201cThe launch of the AI Makerspace represents another milestone in Georgia Tech\u2019s legacy of innovation and leadership in education,\u201d said\u00a0Raheem Beyah, dean\u00a0of the College and Southern Company Chair. \u201cThanks to NVIDIA\u2019s advanced technology and expertise, our students at all levels have a path to make significant contributions and lead in the rapidly evolving field of AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its core, the Georgia Tech AI Makerspace is a dedicated computing cluster paired with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. The software technology resides on an advanced AI infrastructure that is designed, built, and deployed by\u00a0Penguin Solutions, providing a virtual gateway to a high-performance computing environment.\u00a0The first phase of the endeavor is powered by 20 NVIDIA HGX H100 systems, housing 160 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs (graphics processing units), one of the most powerful computational accelerators capable of enabling and supporting advanced AI and machine learning efforts. The system is interconnected with an NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform, featuring in-network computing.\u00a0To put this computational power into perspective, it would take a single NVIDIA H100 GPU one second to come up with a multiplication operation that would take Georgia Tech\u2019s 50,000 students 22 years to achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch of the AI Makerspace represents another milestone in Georgia Tech\u2019s legacy of innovation and leadership in education. Thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s advanced technology and expertise, our students at all levels have a path to make significant contributions and lead in the rapidly evolving field of AI.\nRAHEEM BEYAHDeanSouthern Company Chair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe City of Atlanta commends the leadership of Georgia Tech and the College of Engineering in advancing education and technology through the AI Makerspace,\u201d said Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. \u201cPartnerships with industry leaders such as NVIDIA propel our students and workforce toward tomorrow, further enhancing Atlanta\u2019s status as an innovation hub.\u201dStudents and faculty will also receive support through NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute resources, including faculty-run NVIDIA workshops, certifications, a university ambassador program, curriculum-aided teaching kits, and a developer community network.The collaboration between the Georgia Tech and NVIDIA signifies the College\u2019s significant commitment to best-in-class enterprise AI hardware and software.\u201cAI supercomputers provide a platform to help drive powerful new discoveries that could solve some of the world\u2019s most complex challenges,\u201d said Cheryl Martin, director of Higher Education and Research at NVIDIA. \u201cGeorgia Tech\u2019s AI Makerspace will provide students with access to NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform, equipping them with the technology to push the boundaries of AI learning and research.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Step in the College\u2019s AI for Engineering Initiative\u00a0The AI Makerspace expands on Georgia Tech\u2019s foundational, theory-focused\u00a0AI curriculum by offering students a hands-on platform to tackle real-world AI challenges, develop advanced applications, and present their AI-driven ideas at scale. It also complements two recent \u201cAI for Engineering\u201d announcements by the College: the\u00a0unveiling of Georgia Tech\u2019s first minor degree program in AI and machine learning, as well as the re-imagining and creation of 14 core AI courses for undergrads.\u00a0\u201cThe AI Makerspace represents a significant advancement in technology for education,\u201d explains\u00a0Arijit Raychowdhury, professor and Steve W. Chaddick School Chair of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \u201cTo draw a comparison, the makerspace will provide a technological upgrade equivalent to switching from an etch-a-sketch to an iPad. That\u2019s the level of difference in technology that the AI Makerspace provides to students.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenguin\u2019s comprehensive solution features tightly integrated, end-to-end compute, data management, networking, software, and infrastructure, providing the AI cluster with the ability to process intense amounts of data with ultra-low latency.\u201cBy initially focusing on undergraduates, the AI Makerspace at Georgia Tech is leaning in on the important work of providing technology to help educate an emerging new segment of students who could conceivably be called Generation AI,\u201d said Mark Adams, president and CEO of SGH, Penguin Solutions\u2019 corporate parent. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to partner with Georgia Tech and NVIDIA to help make the AI Makerspace a reality. With the speed and evolution of AI, it\u2019s critical that those who will be developers and users of AI, now and in the future, are grounded by the best in higher education and have access to the latest, ever-evolving technology.\u201d\u00a0The effort is bolstered by Georgia Tech\u2019s Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE), which is providing sustainable leading-edge cyberinfrastructure and support, ensuring students have the necessary tools and assistance to best utilize the cluster.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhassan AlRegib, Raheem Beyah, and Arijit Raychowdhury listen to Ruben Lara of PACE\u2019s cyber infrastructure team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack row, L-R: Ghassan AlRegib (John and Marilu McCarty Chair Professor, ECE), Aaron Jezghani (Research Scientist, PACE), Pam Buffington (Executive Director of Foundational Infrastructure & Technology, OIT), Ruben Lara (Senior Systems Support Engineer Manager, PACE), and Didier Contis (Executive Director Academic Technology, Innovation, Research Computing, OIT).Front row, L-R: Arijit Raychowdhury (Steve W. Chaddick School Chair and Professor, ECE), Raheem Beyah (Dean of the College of Engineering and the Southern Company Chair), and Fang (Cherry) Liu (Senior Research Scientist, PACE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Next Steps for AI EducationUndergraduate students currently enrolled in ECE 4252: Fundamentals of Machine Learning (FunML) are accessing the AI Makerspace to learn, experiment, prototype, and showcase their AI-driven ideas at scale. This fall, the AI Makerspace will be incorporated into the curriculum of all eight engineering schools.\u00a0By spring 2025, all Georgia Tech engineering students \u2014 both undergraduate and graduate \u2014 will have access to non-instructional learning. In 2026, Georgia Tech plans to set up the AI Makerspace Omniverse, a sandbox for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The education and research hub is based on NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for connecting and developing 3D tools and applications, and will be available to all students.\n\n\nTo break down the accessibility barrier students may face with the makerspace, PACE and ECE\u2019s Ghassan AlRegib are developing smart interfaces and strategies to ensure that students from all backgrounds, disciplines, and proficiency levels can effectively utilize the computing power.\u00a0\u201cThe intelligent system will serve as a tutor and facilitator,\u201d said AlRegib, the John and Marilu McCarty Chair of Electrical Engineering. \u201cIt will be the lens through which students can tap into the world of AI, and it will empower them by removing any hurdle that stands in the way of them testing their ideas. It will also facilitate the integration of the AI Makerspace into existing classes.\u201d\u201cDemocratizing AI is not just about giving students access to a large pool of GPU resources,\u201d said Didier Contis, executive director of academic technology, innovation, and research computing for the Office of Information Technology. \u201cDeep collaboration with instructors is required to develop different solutions to empower students to use the resources easily without necessarily having to master specific aspects of AI or the underlying infrastructure.\u201dBeyond traditional computing applications, the hub is designed to be utilized in each of Georgia Tech\u2019s six colleges, placing a unique emphasis on human-AI interaction. By doing so, it ensures that AI is viewed as a transformative force, encouraging innovation that extends beyond the confines of a single field.Finally, and similar to how students use physical makerspaces on campus, Raychowdhury sees the AI Makerspace as a tool for students to create technology that prompts AI start-up companies.\u00a0\u201cAI is increasingly interdisciplinary and an irreversibly important part of today\u2019s workforce,\u201d said Raychowdhury. \u201cTo meet the needs of tomorrow\u2019s innovation, we need a diverse workforce proficient in utilizing AI across all levels.\u201d\n\n\n\n Blank Space (medium)(text and background only visible when logged in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Blank Space (small)(text and background only visible when logged in)\n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Minor Degree in AI and Machine Learning Available Summer 2024\n                          \n\nA new minor in applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning is a partnership between engineering and the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, teaching technical skills alongside ethics and policy considerations.\n\n\n                Learn About the Program\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        College Adds, Reimagines AI Courses for Undergraduates\n                          \n\nIn response to demand from its students, initiatives within faculty research, and increasing needs from industry, the College has created and reimagined more than a dozen courses to strengthen its AI and machine learning education.\n\n\n                Learn More About the Courses\n              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Blank Space (small)(text and background only visible when logged in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Resources\n\n\nOffices and Departments\n\n\nNews Center\n\n\nCampus Calendar\n\n\nSpecial Events\n\n\nGreenBuzz\n\n\nInstitute Communications\n\n\nVisitor Resources\n\n\nCampus Visits\n\n\nDirections to Campus\n\n\nVisitor Parking Information\n\n\nGT visitor Wireless Network Information\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Global Learning Center\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center\n\n\nBarnes and Noble at Georgia Tech\n\n\nFerst Center for the Arts\n\n\nRobert C.

At one point, Nvidia stock had nearly doubled year to date, following another blockbuster earnings report in February, and its market cap topped $2 trillion.\nHowever, as this week's sell-off indicates, much of those gains were primarily driven by sentiment and a fear of missing out (FOMO) on the AI boom.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen stocks have already made gains of several hundred percent like Nvidia and Supermicro have, it doesn't take much for those gains to unwind, and that seems to be what's happening here.\nA negative piece of news causes a little bit of selling, which leads to a flood as investors race to lock in profits before a potential bubble burst.\n\nIs Nvidia stock in trouble?\nThe observation that drove the sell-off could easily be a nonevent, as a Wells Fargo analyst noted that Supermicro did not give its customary preliminary revenue report, possibly implying that its quarterly results were weaker than expected.\nThat's entirely speculation, however, Investors should also be aware that an event like that wouldn't normally cause a stock to plunge 23% like Supermicro did, but it has been highly volatile and propped up in part by momentum and sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as Nvidia is concerned, the GPU maker is a close partner of Supermicro, but Nvidia is much larger, meaning it's not particularly sensitive to Supermicro's results.\nStill, sentiment in the AI sector tends to move these stocks in unison, and Nvidia has also benefited from enthusiasm and high expectations for AI, so it's not surprising to see the stock falling in line with Supermicro.\nIt's too soon to know if today's sell-off is meaningful. Keep an eye on Supermicro's Q3 earnings report, which is due out after hours on April 30, as that will confirm or reverse today's sell-off. Expect Nvidia to move in tandem with Super Micro Computer after that news comes out.\n\n\n\nWells Fargo is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

ACE microservices allow developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars in games and applications. With ACE microservices, NPCs can dynamically interact and converse with players in-game and in real time.\nLeading game developers, studios and startups are already incorporating ACE into their titles, bringing new levels of personality and engagement to NPCs and digital humans.\nBring Avatars to Life With NVIDIA ACE\nThe process of creating NPCs starts with providing them a backstory and purpose, which helps guide the narrative and ensures contextually relevant dialogue. Then, ACE subcomponents work together to build avatar interactivity and enhance responsiveness.\nNPCs tap up to four AI models to hear, process, generate dialogue and respond.\nThe player\u2019s voice first goes into NVIDIA Riva, a technology that builds fully customizable, real-time conversational AI pipelines and turns chatbots into engaging and expressive assistants using GPU-accelerated multilingual speech and translation microservices.\nWith ACE, Riva\u2019s automatic speech recognition (ASR) feature processes what was said and uses AI to deliver a highly accurate transcription in real time. Explore a Riva-powered demo of speech-to-text in a dozen languages.\nThe transcription then goes into an LLM \u2014 such as Google\u2019s Gemma, Meta\u2019s Llama 2 or Mistral \u2014 and taps Riva\u2019s neural machine translation to generate a natural language text response. Next, Riva\u2019s Text-to-Speech functionality generates an audio response.\nFinally, NVIDIA Audio2Face (A2F) generates facial expressions that can be synced to dialogue in many languages. With the microservice, digital avatars can display dynamic, realistic emotions streamed live or baked in during post-processing.\nThe AI network automatically animates face, eyes, mouth, tongue and head motions to match the selected emotional range and level of intensity. And A2F can automatically infer emotion directly from an audio clip.\nEach step happens in real time to ensure fluid dialogue between the player and the character. And the tools are customizable, giving developers the flexibility to build the types of characters they need for immersive storytelling or worldbuilding.\nBorn to Roll\nAt GDC and GTC, developers and platform partners showcased demos leveraging NVIDIA ACE microservices \u2014 from interactive NPCs in gaming to powerful digital human nurses.\nUbisoft is exploring new types of interactive gameplay with dynamic NPCs. NEO NPCs, the product of its latest research and development project, are designed to interact in real time with players, their environment and other characters, opening up new possibilities for dynamic and emergent storytelling.\nThe capabilities of these NEO NPCs were showcased through demos, each focused on different aspects of NPC behaviors, including environmental and contextual awareness; real-time reactions and animations; and conversation memory, collaboration and strategic decision-making. Combined, the demos spotlighted the technology\u2019s potential to push the boundaries of game design and immersion.\nUsing Inworld AI technology, Ubisoft\u2019s narrative team created two NEO NPCs, Bloom and Iron, each with their own background story, knowledge base and unique conversational style. Inworld technology also provided the NEO NPCs with intrinsic knowledge of their surroundings, as well as interactive responses powered by Inworld\u2019s LLM. NVIDIA A2F provided facial animations and lip syncing for the two NPCs real time.\n\nInworld and NVIDIA set GDC abuzz with a new technology demo called Covert Protocol, which showcased NVIDIA ACE technologies and the Inworld Engine. In the demo, players controlled a private detective who completed objectives based on the outcome of conversations with NPCs on the scene. Covert Protocol unlocked social simulation game mechanics with AI-powered digital characters that acted as bearers of crucial information, presented challenges and catalyzed key narrative developments. This enhanced level of AI-driven interactivity and player agency is set to open up new possibilities for emergent, player-specific gameplay.\nBuilt on Unreal Engine 5, Covert Protocol uses the Inworld Engine and NVIDIA ACE, including NVIDIA Riva ASR and A2F, to augment Inworld\u2019s speech and animation pipelines.\nIn the latest version of the NVIDIA Kairos tech demo built in collaboration with Convai, which was shown at CES, Riva ASR and A2F were used to significantly improve NPC interactivity. Convai\u2019s new framework allowed the NPCs to converse among themselves and gave them awareness of objects, enabling them to pick up and deliver items to desired areas. Furthermore, NPCs gained the ability to lead players to objectives and traverse worlds.\nDigital Characters in the Real World\nThe technology used to create NPCs is also being used to animate avatars and digital humans. Going beyond gaming, task-specific generative AI is moving into healthcare, customer service and more.\n\nNVIDIA collaborated with Hippocratic AI at GTC to extend its healthcare agent solution, showcasing the potential of a generative AI healthcare agent avatar. More work underway to develop a super-low-latency inference platform to power real-time use cases.\n\u201cOur digital assistants provide helpful, timely and accurate information to patients worldwide,\u201d said Munjal Shah, cofounder and CEO of Hippocratic AI. \u201cNVIDIA ACE technologies bring them to life with cutting-edge visuals and realistic animations that help better connect to patients.\u201d\nInternal testing of Hippocratic\u2019s initial AI healthcare agents is focused on chronic care management, wellness coaching, health risk assessments, social determinants of health surveys, pre-operative outreach and post-discharge follow-up.\n\nUneeQ is an autonomous digital human platform focused on AI-powered avatars for customer service and interactive applications. UneeQ integrated the NVIDIA A2F microservice into its platform and combined it with its Synanim ML synthetic animation technology to create highly realistic avatars for enhanced customer experiences and engagement.\n\u201cUneeQ combines NVIDIA animation AI with our own Synanim ML synthetic animation technology to deliver real-time digital human interactions that are emotionally responsive and deliver dynamic experiences powered by conversational AI,\u201d said Danny Tomsett, founder and CEO at UneeQ.\nAI in Gaming\nACE is one of the many NVIDIA AI technologies that bring games to the next level.\n\nNVIDIA DLSS is a breakthrough graphics technology that uses AI to increase frame rates and improve image quality on GeForce RTX GPUs.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix enables modders to easily capture game assets, automatically enhance materials with generative AI tools and quickly create stunning RTX remasters with full ray tracing and DLSS.\nNVIDIA Freestyle, accessed through the new NVIDIA app beta, lets users personalize the visual aesthetics of more than 1,200 games through real-time post-processing filters, with features like RTX HDR, RTX Dynamic Vibrance and more.\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast app transforms any room into a home studio, giving livestream AI-enhanced voice and video tools, including noise and echo removal, virtual background and AI green screen, auto-frame, video noise removal and eye contact.\n\nExperience the latest and greatest\u00a0in AI-powered experiences with NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations, and make sense of what\u2019s new, and what\u2019s next, with AI Decoded.\nGet weekly updates directly in your inbox by subscribing to the AI Decoded newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Gaming | Generative AITags: AI Decoded | Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Virtual reality and augmented reality continue their drive into the mainstream. New video compression standards are challenging traditional computing infrastructure. And AI is having an impact across the board.\nIn a situation this dynamic, media companies will benefit most from AI-enabled media solutions that flexibly align with their changing development and delivery needs.\nNVIDIA Holoscan for Media, available now, is a software-defined platform that enables developers to easily build live media applications, supercharge them with AI and then deploy them across media platforms.\nA New Approach to Media Application Development\u00a0\nHoloscan for Media offers a new approach to development in live media. It simplifies application development by providing an internet protocol (IP)-based, cloud-native architecture that isn\u2019t constrained by dedicated hardware, environments or locations. Instead, it integrates open-source and ubiquitous technologies and streamlines application delivery to customers, all while optimizing costs.\nTraditional application development for the live media market relies on dedicated hardware. Because software is tied to that hardware, developers are constrained when it comes to innovating or upgrading applications.\nEach deployment type, whether on premises or in the cloud, requires its own build, making development costly and inefficient. Beyond designing an application\u2019s user interface and core functionalities, developers have to build out additional infrastructure services, further eating into research and development budgets.\nThe most significant challenge is incorporating AI, due to the complexity of building an AI software stack. This prevents many applications in pilot programs from moving to production.\nHoloscan for Media eases the integration of AI into application development due to its underlying architecture, which enables software-defined video to be deployed on the same software stack as AI applications, including generative AI-based tools. This benefits vendors and research and development departments looking to incorporate AI apps into live video.\nSince the platform is cloud-native, the same architecture can run independent of location, whether in the cloud, on premises or at the edge. Additionally, it\u2019s not tied to a specific device, field-programmable gate array or appliance.\nThe Holoscan for Media architecture includes services like authentication, logging and security, as well as features that help broadcasters migrate to IP-based technologies, including the SMPTE ST 2110 transport protocol, the precision time protocol for timing and synchronization, and the NMOS controller and registry for dynamic device management.\nA Growing Ecosystem of Partners\nBeamr, Comprimato, Lawo, Media.Monks, Pebble, RED Digital Cinema, Sony Corporation and Telestream are among the early adopters already transforming live media with Holoscan for Media.\n\u201cWe use Holoscan for Media as the core infrastructure for our broadcast and media workflow, granting us powerful scale to deliver interest-based content across a wide range of channels and platforms,\u201d said Lewis Smithingham, senior vice president of innovation special operations at Media.Monks, a provider of software-defined production workflows.\n\u201cBy compartmentalizing applications and making them interoperable, Holoscan for Media allows for easy adoption of new innovations from many different companies in one platform,\u201d said Jeff Goodman, vice president of product management at RED Digital Cinema, a manufacturer of professional digital cinema cameras. \u201cIt takes much of the integration complexity out of the equation and will significantly increase the pace of innovation. We are very excited to be a part of it.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe NVIDIA Holoscan for Media is one of the paths forward to enabling the development of next-generation products and services for the industry, allowing the scaling of GPU power as needed,\u201d said Masakazu Murata, senior general manager of media solutions business at Sony Corporation. \u201cOur M2L-X software switcher prototype running on Holoscan for Media demonstrates how customers can run Sony\u2019s solutions on GPU clusters.\u201d\n\u201cTelestream is committed to transforming the media landscape, enhancing efficiency and content experiences without sacrificing quality or user-friendliness,\u201d said Charlie Dunn, senior vice president and general manager at Telestream, a provider of digital media software and solutions. \u201cWe\u2019ve seamlessly integrated the Holoscan for Media platform into our INSPECT IP video monitoring solution to achieve a clear and efficient avenue for ST 2110 compliance.\u201d\nExperience Holoscan for Media at NAB Show\nThese partners will showcase how they\u2019re using NVIDIA Holoscan for Media at NAB Show, an event for the broadcast, media and entertainment industry, taking place April 13-17 in Las Vegas.\nExplore development on Holoscan for Media and discover applications running on the platform at the Dell Technologies booth.

The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI has advanced. AI has huge potential in the coming years as it bolsters industries such as consumer tech, cloud computing, machine learning, autonomous vehicles, and much more.\nIn fact, data from Grand View Research shows the AI market reached about $200 billion last year and is projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. So, despite a monster rally for AI stocks last year, it's not too late to invest and benefit from the sector's development over the long term.\nNvidia (NVDA -1.69%) and Amazon (AMZN -1.09%) are two attractive options. One dominates the AI chip market, and the other is a leader in cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing areas of AI.\nSo, let's compare these companies and determine whether Nvidia or Amazon is the better AI stock right now.\nNvidia\nNvidia became a favorite on Wall Street last year, with its stock up about 225% since last April. The company's hardware became the gold standard in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2023 as developers worldwide loaded up on its chips. As a result, Nvidia achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs alongside soaring earnings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. This monster growth was primarily due to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's free cash flow was up 430% in the past year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than rival chipmakers AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI gave the company an edge, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy.\nThe vast potential of AI indicates that chip demand will continue rising, and Nvidia will likely continue to see major gains from the industry.\nAmazon\nAmazon became a household name worldwide thanks to the success of its e-commerce site, responsible for 38% of the online retail market. The company's role in the industry is paramount, with Walmart in a distant second place with a 6% share. \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income despite contributing the smallest portion of revenue among Amazon's three segments. \n\nAWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI. As the world's biggest cloud service provider, AWS has the potential to leverage its cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market.\nSo, it's unsurprising that Amazon is investing heavily in this lucrative sector. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. The platform launched Bedrock, a program that helps customers build generative AI applications. It also unveiled CodeWhisperer, which is capable of generating code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool that can transcribe patient-to-physician conversations.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia or Amazon the better AI stock?\nNvidia and Amazon have potent positions in AI that will likely allow them to profit from the industry's tailwinds for years.\nHowever, the data below indicates Amazon's stock is currently trading at a much more appealing valuation.\n\nData by YCharts\nThis chart shows Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios are significantly higher than the same metrics from Amazon.\n\n\n\n\n\nP/S is calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. Meanwhile, price-to-free-cash-flow divides its market cap by free cash flow, which is what's left of cash flow after capital expenditure and operating costs. These are helpful valuation metrics because they consider a company's financial health alongside its share price. For both, the lower the figure, the better the value. And in this case, Amazon's stock is a bargain compared to Nvidia's.\nAmazon's free cash flow hit more than $32 billion last year, while Nvidia reached $27 billion. It's not a huge difference, but it does show Amazon is potentially in a better position to keep investing in its AI technology and overcome potential headwinds.\nAmazon is a tech behemoth on its way to becoming a major threat in AI. It's also a better-valued stock, making Amazon a no-brainer over Nvidia and a screaming buy right now.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

There always is.\n \n\n\n\n \n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is the business equivalent of Caitlin Clark. By that I mean the performance of Nvidia stock in 2024 has made him a legend. His $79.4 billion fortune makes him the 18th richest person in the world. That wealth is up four-fold in a year.\nHuang\u2019s every public utterance is picked through for lessons in excellence. \u201cI hope suffering happens to you,\u201d\u00a0he says, and we nod in agreement. \u201cIf I had to do it all over again I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d But what does this mean for a small equity investor? Nothing good.\nNvidia Stock and Jensen Huang\nWhen a rumor spread April 1 that Nvidia had bought the Xbox brand from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), reporters began analyzing it before looking at the calendar. \nNvidia\u2019s leadership in AI is now taken for granted. Its Blackwell technology guarantees that artificial general intelligence will be here in a few years.\nHuang has made thousands of CEOs into techno-optimists, with tricks like talking robots and brute force computing replacing human intuition. \nThe company\u2019s recent Developer Conference quickly became an \u201cAI Woodstock,\u201d filled with demonstrations and claims that aren\u2019t in the market yet.\nNumbers, Please\nNvidia stock has had a rough time getting over $900/share in the last month for a reason.\nNvidia\u2019s $2.25 trillion valuation is held up by quarterly revenue that tripled in a single year, and profit margins of 72%. Its operating cash flow in 2024 was three times the previous record, and analysts see it doubling again in 2025.\nBut even given all that, its current valuation is outlandish. It trades at 20 times that expected 2025 revenue, and 16 times the expected fiscal 2026 revenue of $136 billion. \nAssume for a moment Nvidia stock can hit the $42/share of earnings estimated by the most optimistic analysts for 2026. You\u2019re paying 21 times those earnings to own the stock right now.\nLogic says it\u2019s time to take something off the table.\nThe Nvidia Hype Cycle\nThere are signs in the AI community that the brute force AI approach made possible by Nvidia may be sub-optimal.\nThere are signs that a model with 1 trillion parameters could be analyzed with much less hardware than we once imagined. It turns out bigger isn\u2019t always better.\nThe signs seen by data scientists aren\u2019t yet being seen by AI analysts. But they are being seen by the Cloud Czars who are Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers. Small models may outperform bigger ones. It\u2019s possible to run an AI model on a phone.\nEvery emerging technology goes through what Gartner (NYSE:IT) calls a hype cycle. Generative AI is now at the peak of expectations. What analysts should be looking for is an event that starts the \u201ctrough of disillusionment.\u201d \nThat\u2019s a necessary sell-off before we figure out the true value of AI and start making money from it.\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock \nI know where the trough hit the original Internet bubble, because I was there.\nIt came on January 10, 2000, when Time Warner \u201cbought\u201d AOL. AOL was so over-valued it owned 55% of the resulting company. At that point Internet asset valuations reached their peak.\nThey proved out in time. Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit its 1999 price in 2009 and never looked back. Companies like Alphabet (NASDASQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) that understood what their business was prospered.\nNvidia stock will, too.\nBut there\u2019s a hard rain going to fall before that happens. We saw it in 2000, we saw it in 2008, and we saw it in 2022. You don\u2019t want to be in it when the storm hits.\nI can\u2019t tell you what event might set it off. Maybe Nvidia really will buy the Xbox. That would do it.\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL.

And investors should be able to count on the tech giant's streak extending to four quarters. For the quarter that ends in late April, management guided for the company's top and bottom lines to surge 234% and 396%, respectively, year over year.\nNvidia's powerful financial results have propelled its stock to tremendous gains. In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, Nvidia stock rocketed 82.5%, making it the second-best performer on the S&P 500 index, and its long-term performance is even more impressive. (Super Micro Computer, a server specialist, was the index's top performer in Q1.)\nNvidia's AI chip dominance is the key catalyst for its stock's amazing run\nThe primary catalyst behind Nvidia's rapid business growth is incredibly strong demand for its chips and related products that accelerate the processing of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in data centers. Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips have emerged as the best type of general chips for this purpose -- and Nvidia is the leading maker of discrete GPUs. Discrete means the GPUs are distinct chips, as opposed to being integrated with a central processing unit (CPU) chip.\nEstimates vary, but it's widely projected that Nvidia has a roughly 90% share of the data center AI GPU chip market, and about an 80% share of the entire data center AI chip market. The latter includes the custom AI processing chips that some of the larger tech companies have developed.\nNvidia's data center business was already growing at a robust rate over the long term before a new type of AI -- generative AI -- arrived on the tech scene. This occurred in late 2022 when OpenAI broadly released its ChatGPT chatbot. Generative AI opens up a massive range of potentially new applications for AI, so companies are eager to incorporate it into their businesses. This eagerness has lit a fire under Nvidia's sales of its family of data center products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 4.7 million reasons why Nvidia's AI chip dominance should endure\nIt's natural for investors to wonder if the other companies that make GPU chips -- namely, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel -- or companies that could enter this business will eventually catch up to or even surpass Nvidia in the AI GPU chip market.\nSure, competitors could gain some market share. That's largely because Nvidia can't keep up with the voracious demand for its data center GPUs and associated products. However, it will be nearly impossible for any company to steal Nvidia's AI GPU chip crown, in my view. Moreover, it's unlikely that a competitor will even get close to Nvidia's market share in AI-enabling GPUs.\nWhy?\nThe company addressed this topic in its February annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. [Emphasis mine] Our computing platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP [cloud service provider], as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. [Emphasis mine. Yes, the number of developers is where the article's heading comes from.]\n\nCUDA is Nvidia's programming model that enables its GPUs to possess the parallel processing capabilities needed for accelerating general and AI computing. Not only are a huge number of developers using CUDA, but many of them have been doing so for a long time, as Nvidia developed CUDA in 2006.\nA virtuous circle (or cycle), according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is \"a chain of events in which one desirable occurrence leads to another which further promotes the first occurrence and so on...\" In Nvidia's case, this virtuous circle works in a similar way as I recently described it operating for Arm Holdings, the leading designer of CPU chips:\n\nThe more hardware built using Arm IP, the more software that's written for Arm. And the more software that's written for Arm, the more popular hardware based on its IP [intellectual property] becomes because that hardware has more or better applications and features. And so on and so on.\n\nIn short, Nvidia's big head start in the AI GPU space has led to it benefitting from a virtuous circle. And this virtuous circle provides it with a tight grip on the AI GPU market.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Here's what you need to know.\n\nIt's not just about the hardware\nMany investors are looking to invest in a company developing a quantum computer. That makes sense. Before software and services can be developed, hardware itself is where it all begins.\nThere is incredible promise in quantum computing, which uses \"superposition\" in quantum mechanics to store and compute exponentially more information than classical computers, including Nvidia's accelerated compute systems powered by its leading GPU chips. \n\n\n\n\n\nA company that could solve the many challenges with developing an intricate system that taps the power of quantum mechanics could make a great deal of money. Only a few publicly traded start-ups are available, including IonQ, but all of these companies are still in research and development (R&D) mode. Nvidia is in on this game, but it has taken a hybrid approach.\nIn March 2023, Nvidia announced -- in conjunction with privately held start-up Quantum Machines -- a GPU-accelerated quantum computing control unit that orchestrates the operations of a quantum computer. I wrote about it here about a year ago. \nAt the GTC event, Huang said:\n\nWe should be a great partner for the quantum computing industry. How else are you going to drive a quantum computer? To have the world's fastest computer sitting next to it?\u00a0And how are you going to simulate a quantum computer, emulate a quantum computer? What is the programming model for a quantum computer? You can't just program a quantum computer all by itself. You need to have classical computing sitting next to it. And so the quantum would be kind of a quantum accelerator. ... Who should go do that? Well, we've done that. \n\nNvidia, the world's largest researcher?\nWhat Huang is saying is that Nvidia is already at the heart of the quantum industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese complex new quantum computing systems aren't just going to be invented out of thin air. Nvidia's acceleration platform is even now powering the R&D work on the hardware itself, helping simulate the design of new types of \"chips\" for quantum computing.\nThe work doesn't stop there. Nvidia is also helping to accelerate the coding of the new software that will run on a quantum computer, since superposition that encodes that exponential leap in information can't simply operate on the classical ones and zeroes that our computers today use. And even once quantum computers begin to go into more widespread use, they will need a classical computer interface so that the massive amount of data being cranked out is usable to users of classical computers.\nAll of this is where Nvidia comes in. Much like it has done with its AI systems, it has an ecosystem of hardware (like the aforementioned one with Quantum Machines) and a library of software algorithms sitting atop the hardware, powering the quantum computing industry R&D efforts. \nTo be clear, Nvidia itself is not involved in developing a quantum computer -- at least, not that it has publicly disclosed. Instead, it is using its computing acceleration prowess using AI and a library of development software to help researchers and start-ups around the globe bring useful quantum computers to market. In conversations with Nvidia and others in the industry, widespread commercialization (not R&D spending) is likely still at least a few years away, if not more.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil then, add quantum computing R&D spending -- which no doubt gets filed under Nvidia's large and fast-growing \"data center\" revenue segment -- to the list of reasons Nvidia stock is worth holding for the long term.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Nvidia.

These two have had a phenomenal 2024 so far, with Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) up over 250% and Nvidia up by 80%. \nBut that performance becomes even more impressive if you backdate to the start of 2023, as Supermciro and Nvidia are up an astounding 1,160% and 520%, respectively. That level of performance might have investors wondering if there's room for more. If there is, the next obvious question is, \"Which one should I buy?\"\nSo, between the two, which is the better AI stock to buy today? Let's find out.\nNvidia and Supermicro work together\nThese two companies aren't competitors; they are complementary. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) -- computing hardware that specializes in effectively processing intense calculations. These devices have been used for gaming graphics, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, AI model training, and practically every other use that would require significant computing power to process.\n\nFortunately for Nvidia, most users (besides gamers) don't just have a single GPU. They buy hundreds or thousands of them and connect them to form supercomputers often housed in servers at a data center.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, haphazardly linking them together will not result in an optimized computing experience, which is where Supermicro comes in.\nSupermicro specializes in server design and has separated itself from competitors by offering highly customizable products that can be designed for workload type and size. Furthermore, Supermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure its servers have been designed in an optimized manner so the end-user gets the most use out of their product.\n\nThis brings up the first difference: Supermicro has less differentiating technology. While Nvidia's GPUs are market-leading, Supermicro relies on industry knowledge and customization to separate itself from competitors. This can be a sustainable advantage, but it's less sustainable than having superior technology.\nAnother difference is that Supermicro is essentially an Nvidia reseller. It takes Nvidia's GPUs and other components to make its servers and then sells them to its clients. Because it cannot control the GPU pricing (the most significant cost of the server), Supermicro's margins are much slimmer than Nvidia's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMCI Gross Profit Margin data by YCharts\nOnce again, this is just a differentiating factor. Plenty of businesses have succeeded with much lower margins.\nBut when it all adds up, my lean starts to go in Nvidia's direction due to its technological prowess and higher margins. Additionally, when I look at each stock's valuation, Nvidia also looks to have an advantage there.\nSupermicro's stock has gotten very expensive\nAfter these two stocks' incredible runs, valuing them can be difficult. Trailing metrics aren't useful, as they are still undergoing massive changes (both Supermicro and Nvidia grew revenue by over 100% in their latest results). As a result, I'll use a forward-facing metric like the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nForward metrics have their issues, as they utilize analyst projections to value a company, which isn't an exact science. Still, it's arguably the best way to value these businesses, but Supermicro certainly comes with a price premium over Nvidia on this basis.\n\nSMCI PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nThis makes sense, as Supermicro's boom is just beginning, while Nvidia's is starting to mature (even though Wall Street analysts project nearly 100% revenue growth this year). \nWith Nvidia's stock trading at a lower level (and thus lower expectations to meet) than Supermicro's, I think there's no doubt that Nvidia is the superior AI stock. That's not to say that Supermicro is a bad stock, as it will likely continue to succeed due to its strong product offering and customization. However, the valuation bar is a bit higher for Supermicro, so I'm giving the nod to Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Jim Cramer, host of\u00a0CNBC's\u00a0Mad Money, discussed last month why he believes Nvidia will\u00a0\u201ccreate the next industrial revolution.\u201d\u00a0In the words of Cramer, the chip maker\u00a0\"wields immense power because its software can speed up processes and innovation, as well as cut costs, for companies in a wide array of sectors.\"Cramer believes Nvidia is worth its valuation even though the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0business is more\u00a0of a \"behind-the-scenes kind of story.\" Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) are\u00a0currently\u00a0powering almost every industry as the AI era progresses.Four months into 2024, the stock is up\u00a077% year-to-date, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's ($NASX) 6.1% increase. Most Wall Street analysts expect the stock to soar as the company penetrates more industries.\u00a0The stock has an overall\u00a0\"strong buy\"\u00a0rating, and Cantor Fitzgerald recently backed a high target price of $1,200 - implying about 36.7% upside in one\u00a0year. I believe it is a realistic goal for the chip giant.Barchart Nvidia\u2019s Financials Are SoaringOne of\u00a0Nvidia's\u00a0key strengths is its ability to adapt and diversify its product offerings, which has helped it grow financially.In the recent fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue rose\u00a0an impressive\u00a0265% from the year-ago quarter to $22.1 billion.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0adjusted earnings per share (EPS) also jumped 486% to $5.16 in the quarter.\u00a0For the full fiscal year 2024, revenue and earnings jumped 126% and 586%, respectively. In recent years, NVIDIA has emerged as a leader in the data center market. Its Data Center segment contributes the most to its top line, accounting for 83% of total revenue in Q1. The\u00a0segment\u2019s\u00a0revenue increased 409% from the year-ago quarter.\u00a0Revenue from its other segments, Gaming and Professional Visualization, increased 56% and 105%\u00a0year on year\u00a0in the quarter, respectively.\u00a0Recently, Nvidia announced its decision to\u00a0acquire\u00a0Kubernetes-based workload management and orchestration software provider Run:ai. The agreement aims to help customers\u00a0\"make more efficient use of their AI computing resources.\"Furthermore, the rise of autonomous vehicles has provided Nvidia\u00a0with\u00a0another lucrative opportunity.\u00a0Nvidia's\u00a0DRIVE platform offers automakers a comprehensive solution for developing self-driving cars. Though the Automotive segment fell 4% in Q4, strategic partnerships with leading automakers have the potential to\u00a0enhance the performance of this segment.\u00a0Notably,\u00a0EV manufacturers such as ZEEKR, Xiaomi, and Great Wall Motor have chosen\u00a0Nvidia's\u00a0Drive Orin platform, while Li Auto LI has chosen\u00a0Nvidia's\u00a0Drive Thor platform for their autonomous vehicles.Fiscal 2025 Could Be Another Strong YearNvidia will report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. Management anticipates a revenue increase of 234% (plus or minus 2%) to $24 billion. Similarly, analysts expect revenue and earnings growth of 238.4% and 527%, respectively, in Q1.Analysts expect Nvidia to have another\u00a0strong\u00a0fiscal year in 2025, with revenue and earnings up by 83.4% and 92.8%, respectively. Currently, Nvidia stock trades at\u00a033 times\u00a0forward fiscal 2025 estimated\u00a0earnings,\u00a0versus its five-year historical average price-to-earnings ratio of 65.1x.\u00a0I agree with Jim Cramer that Nvidia stock appears to be still reasonably priced,\u00a0given\u00a0the explosive growth potential of AI over the next decade\u00a0or so.What Do Analysts Say About Nvidia?Recently,\u00a0Citi\u00a0analyst\u00a0Atif Malik reiterated his\u00a0\u201cbuy\u201d\u00a0rating on Nvidia stock, noting that AI server processor sales could double this year and grow at a 50% compounded annual rate over the next five years.Overall, NVDA continues to maintain its\u00a0\u201cstrong buy\u201d\u00a0rating among Wall Street analysts. Out of the 40 analysts covering the stock, 35 have a\u00a0\u201cstrong buy\u201d\u00a0recommendation, with two\u00a0\u201cmoderate buy\u201d\u00a0ratings and three\u00a0\u201chold\u201d\u00a0ratings.\u00a0Its average\u00a0analyst\u00a0target price is $948.73, which is 8.1% above current levels. Its Street-high target of $1,200 indicates an upside potential of 36.7% over the next 12 months.\u00a0Barchart Nvidia Remains The Best AI Bet NowOverall, Nvidia stock represents a compelling investment opportunity for those who believe in the future of technology and AI. Nvidia's relentless focus on innovation, extensive presence in\u00a0a variety of\u00a0industries, and strong financial performance may help Nvidia continue to rule the stock market.Furthermore, a\u00a0strong start to\u00a0fiscal 2025 could cause Nvidia's stock to skyrocket. The stock is still down 10% from its 52-week high, making now the ideal time to buy this best AI bet on the dip.On the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Here Are the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks He Bought Instead.      Danny Vena, The Motley Fool   April 5, 2024 5 min read        17   In This Article:  NVDA       GOOG       MSFT       AMZN         Billionaire David Tepper made quite a name for himself on Wall Street. He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" and also consistently outperforms his peers. He correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest. It raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"   Image source: Getty Images.   A changing of the guard In the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio.  The sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep. Tepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million. In this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search. The Magnificent Seven stocks he bought instead In moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools.   Story Continues The biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.Microsoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services.The company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.And with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.A timely investing lessonSo far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks.There's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different.Influential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it's best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company's prospects.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In 2022, e-commerce titan Amazon and Google parent Alphabet each had stock splits. Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%), the leading producer of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, split its stock in 2021, and iPhone maker Apple did so the year before.\nThe stock of one of these companies -- Nvidia -- has run up tremendously recently. It has soared largely due to powerful demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the training of AI models and running of AI applications in data centers. Nvidia stock entered 2023 at $146.07 per share, and on April 19, 2024, it closed at $762.00. That's a hefty gain of 422% in 16 months.\nMoreover, Nvidia's lofty stock price suggests the company could split its stock again soon.\nNvidia stock-split history\nNvidia held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999. The stock's IPO price was $12 per share. Since then, Nvidia stock has split five times. The IPO price adjusted for stock splits is $0.25.\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nStock-Split Type\n\n\nShare Price Prior to Stock-Split Announcement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 20, 2021\n\n\n4-for-1\n\n\n$583.36 (May 20, 2021)\n\n\n\n\nSep 11, 2007\n\n\n3-for-2\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nApr 07, 2006\n\n\n2-for-1\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nSep 12, 2001\n\n\n2-for-1\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nJun 27, 2000\n\n\n2-for-1\n\nN/A\n\n\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo Finance. N/A= not explored in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Nvidia stock was priced at $583.36 on the day prior to the company announcing its intention to split its stock. That's nearly $180 less than its current stock price, which provides strong support for the theory the company could split its stock in 2024.\nHere's a summary of the key events involved in Nvidia's last stock split: \n\nMay 21, 2021 -- The company announced its board of directors declared a 4-for-1 split of its common stock. As is standard practice, the split was contingent upon being approved by stockholders at the company's annual meeting. Nvidia shares gained 6% in the week following this announcement.\nJune 3 -- Shareholders voted to approve the split.\nJuly 19 -- Shareholders of record on June 21 received three additional shares of stock for every one share they held on the record date.\nJuly 20 -- Nvidia stock began trading at its split-adjusted price.\n\nNvidia hasn't yet announced the date of its 2024 annual meeting, but it should be sometime in June. In 2023, it was on June 22.\nIf Nvidia intends to split its stock this year, investors can expect it to release a statement a couple of weeks in advance of its 2024 annual meeting. This would likely be in the late May to early June time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill an Nvidia stock split matter?\nA Nvidia stock split won't change the underlying value of the company, nor will it alter an investor's proportionate stake in Nvidia.\nBut stock splits can result in several benefits for investors. The first one has to do with accessibility, as a split should increase the size of the pool of individual investors who might buy the stock. An investor would now need to plunk down $762 to buy a single share of Nvidia. Some folks might only have $250 or $500 to invest. Others might be able to afford to buy one share, but don't want to invest that much money in Nvidia, at least at one time.\nThere are some online brokerages that permit investors to buy (and sell) a fraction of one share. But not all of them do. And my guess is that most investors prefer owning a whole number of shares.\nExisting investors might also benefit from an Nvidia stock split. Soon after a company announces it intends to split its stock, the stock will often rise. This is due to investors' expectation that there will be greater demand for the stock when its accessibility increases. These post-announcement stock bumps, however, are not always sustained.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, an Nvidia stock split would give the company a much better chance at being included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the oldest U.S. stock index. This 30-large stock index is price-weighted, which means that extremely high-priced stocks have little chance of being included because they would have too much effect on the index price. A Dow index membership would mean that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to track the Dow would have to buy shares of Nvidia. This increased demand would exert upward pressure on the stock price.\nSplit or not, Nvidia stock is a great way to invest in the AI boom\nIn short, a stock split has the potential to be a slight positive for Nvidia stock. Stock split or not, Nvidia stock remains a great way to invest in the AI boom. That said, investors who are concerned about Nvidia's valuation being too high could buy a portfolio of chip stocks by buying an ETF. The two best-performing semiconductor ETFs over the short and longer terms are VanEck Semiconductor ETF and iShares Semiconductor ETF.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

AI-related technologies are expected to drive revenue gains for nearly all the world's biggest tech giants over the coming years as companies look to leverage their massive datasets in order to enhance sales of everything from drive-through dining to the most complicated pharmaceutical testing.  Tapping into those data requires big investments in computing infrastructure, often based in virtual cloud computing environments, which are built and managed by so-called hypercalers like Alphabet's\u00a0Google Cloud, Microsoft's\u00a0 (MSFT) \u00a0Azure and Amazon Web Services\u00a0 (AMZN) . And with AI potential now unlocked by the advances in chip design, speed, energy consumption and costs, these hyperscalers are seeing perhaps the biggest demand surge on record for their essential cloud services.   The world's biggest tech companies are set to spend hundreds of billions on AI-related technologies over the next two years, much of it on Nvidia products.   Building and maintaining those networks, however, comes at a steep cost and requires investors to take a leap of faith and companies such as Google and Microsoft are committing to spending billions while generating only a relatively small amount of revenue from their AI-focused products. Capital expenditure is the new Big Tech focus That puts the topic of capital expenditures, or capex, at the heart of the AI investment story and cements the market leadership of chipmaker Nvidia\u00a0 (NVDA) \u00a0regardless of which tech giant emerges as the hyperscaler of choice. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, in fact, sees the data center market growing at $250 billion a year \u2013 on top of an installed base he estimates is already valued at $1 trillion \u2013 as companies like IBM and Alibaba Cloud mount nascent challenges to their larger rivals. And much like the men and women who sold pickaxes and sifting pans during the California gold rush, he seems thoroughly agnostic about who will win.  \"We sell an entire data center in parts, and so our percentage of that $250 billion per year is likely a lot, lot, lot higher than somebody who sells a chip,\" Huang told investors during the group's GTC developers' conference in San Jose, Calif., last month. Related: Analyst revamps Nvidia stock price target as Mag 7 earnings loom Nvidia, which currently boasts an estimated 80% share of the market for AI-powering processors, used the GTC event to unveil its iteration to its lineup, the Blackwell GPU architecture, which could command a 40% premium to the current range for H100 chips, which go for between $30,000 and $40,000 each.   Story Continues That level of cost goes a long way toward explaining the massive amounts of capital spending unveiled by Microsoft and Alphabet, two of Nvidia's biggest customers, earlier this week as well as the spending plans outlined by Meta Platforms'\u00a0 (META) \u00a0Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's\u00a0 (TSLA) \u00a0Elon Musk.Alphabet\u00a0 (GOOG) \u00a0CEO Sundar Pichai hinted at capex levels of around $50 billion this year and $57 billion in 2025.Winning the AI race will cost billions\"We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure,\" Pichai told investors on April 25.\u00a0\"You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud and help us push the frontiers of AI models.\"Google's first quarter capex was pegged at $12 billion, nearly double the tally from a year earlier, driven\u00a0\"overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers.\"Microsoft, meanwhile, is planning a capex tally of around $50 billion for its coming financial year, which begins in July, after fiscal third-quarter spending surged nearly 80% to $14 billion.Related: Analysts eye Google spending ahead of earnings as Meta spooks AI bets\"We have been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to keep taking that forward,\" CEO Satya Nadella told investors on April 25.Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors on the group's most recent earnings call that while it's still working through spending plans for the year, \"we do expect capex to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions, but primarily the work we're doing with generative-AI projects.\"Nvidia GPUs are central to AI ambitionsMeta Platforms, which has committed to buying around 350,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics chips, forecast its 2024 capex bill at between $35 billion to $40 billion, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors he's likely to deploy around 85,000 of them this year as part of his new pivot toward AI and autonomous driving.\"For Tech, AI capex is as important as the AI contribution in our view, and 2024 marks the first of a multi-year investment cycle,.\" BoFA analyst said in a recent client note. \"Hyperscalers' capex outlook confirmed this thesis\u00a0(and)\u00a0GDP data corroborates that we are now into the second quarter of the Tech spend cycle.\"Nvidia is slated to report its first quarter earnings on May 22, and early indications suggest an overall revenue tally of $24.5 billion, the vast majority powered by data center sales.While that's a staggering 245% gain from the year-earlier period, it could be tweaked even higher now that its biggest customers have outlined some of their spending plans.\"Many of our customers that we have already spoken with talked about the designs, talked about the specs, have provided us their demand desires,\" Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told investors at the group's GTC conference last month. \"And that has been very helpful for us to begin our supply chain work, to begin our volumes and what we're going to do.\"Related: Analysts reset Microsoft stock price targets ahead of highly anticipated earningsHowever, in much the same way as Microsoft and Alphabet have told investors that data center demand has far outpaced their ability to supply it, Nvidia also faces capacity constraints.Chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, often called CoWoS, is a crucial component of AI chipmaking and has been weighing on Nvidia deliveries for much of the past year.Taiwan Semiconductor\u00a0 (TSM) , the world's biggest chip contractor, has struggled to meet the surge for its high-end stacking and packing technology and has warned investors \"that condition will continue probably to next year.\"AMD has a firm grip on second place\"It's very true though that on the onset of the very first one coming to market, there might be constraints until we can meet some of the demand that's put in front of us,\" Kress said during her call with analysts last month.That could provide a boost for Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0 (AMD) ,\u00a0the only real rival to Nvidia's\u00a0global market dominance, and its newly-minted MI300X chip.Earlier this year,\u00a0AMD said the new chip could generate around $3.5 billion in sales over the coming year as the group leverages its new launch against Nvidia's ability to meet the global surge in demand.More AI Stocks:Analyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle deal Veteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stock AMD will post its own first quarter earnings after the close of trading on April 30, but analysts see sales rising only around 4%, to $5.5 billion, as demand in the global PC market, a key revenue driver, remains muted.Nvidia shares closed at $877.35 each on April 26, after rising 6.18% on the session and extending their year-to-date gain to around 225%. That puts the chipmaker's market value at $2.19 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world by that measure.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

However, if you are looking to buy an AI stock right now and need to choose between Nvidia and Arm Holdings, which one should you buy?\nLet's find out.\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia's eye-popping stock market surge can be justified by the company's terrific share of the AI chip market, which has led to a sharp acceleration in the company's revenue and earnings growth in recent quarters. The graphics specialist ended fiscal 2024 with $60.9 billion in revenue, an increase of 126% over the prior year.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up 288% in fiscal 2024 to $12.96 per share, driven by a jump of 14.6 percentage points in the company's gross margin. That's not surprising as the chipmaker has been enjoying immense pricing power in the AI chip market. Its flagship H100 AI processor reportedly carries a hefty margin of 1,000%, according to financial services and investment banking provider Raymond James.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, customers have been willing to pay the high prices of Nvidia's AI processors as they don't want to be left behind in the race to develop AI applications. Meta Platforms, for instance, is going to spend more money on procuring Nvidia's H100 processor in 2024. It is also worth noting that major cloud computing providers have already set their sights on deploying Nvidia's next-generation AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture.\nAll this indicates why Nvidia is anticipating that the demand for its upcoming AI processors will continue to be higher than supply, even though the company has been taking steps to boost its production capacity. The healthy demand for Nvidia's AI chips explains why analysts have significantly upgraded their revenue growth expectations from the company for the current fiscal year and beyond.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nEven better, analysts estimate that Nvidia's robust share of the AI chip market is likely to translate into healthy long-term growth, with its data center revenue alone jumping to $280 billion by 2027. As such, Nvidia could continue to be a top growth stock thanks to the fact that it currently controls more than 90% of the lucrative AI chip market, which is expected to generate more than $300 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case for Arm Holdings\nLike Nvidia, Arm Holdings is also a play on the AI chip market. However, unlike Nvidia, the company isn't involved in manufacturing chips. Instead, Arm licenses its intellectual property (IP), software tools, and architecture to chipmakers so that they can develop and manufacture different types of processors such as central processing units (CPUs), neural processing units (NPUs), and graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe demand for all these types of chips is increasing thanks to the growing adoption of AI servers, personal computers (PCs), and smartphones. Not surprisingly, the number of companies looking to develop AI chips with the help of Arm's IP has also increased. Arm reported that 27 companies are using its total access license at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up from 18 at the end of fiscal 2023.\nThe company credits the new licensing agreements to the growing demand for \"high-performance CPUs etc. to embedded AI into every end device.\" The new licenses explain why Arm's revenue pipeline saw a significant improvement. Its remaining performance obligations (RPO), which refers to the total value of a company's unfulfilled contracts, shot up to $2.4 billion in fiscal Q3, up 38% from the year-ago period.\nThere is a solid chance that Arm will be able to sustain this newly found momentum in the long run as well. That's because the company's architecture powers more than 50% of the chips that have a processor inside them. Also, the adoption of the company's AI-specific Armv9 architecture, which commands double the royalty compared to the previous generation's architecture, is increasing at a nice pace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all, it is easy to see why analysts raised their revenue growth projections from Arm as well.\n\nARM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nAlso, analysts forecast the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of just over 44% over the next five years, which is higher than the 38% annual earnings growth expected from Nvidia.\nThe verdict\nBoth Arm Holdings and Nvidia benefit from the proliferation of AI chips. However, investors looking to choose one of these two AI stocks now would be better off investing in Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's because Nvidia stock is significantly cheaper than Arm Holdings right now from a valuation perspective. Nvidia's sales multiple of 36 is lower than Arm's reading of 44. A similar story unfolds if we look at their trailing and forward earnings multiples.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts\nMoreover, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Arm, as the latter's revenue is expected to increase 19% this year. Arm, therefore, is expensive if you consider the potential growth that it is expected to deliver, making Nvidia the better AI stock to buy right now as it is not only delivering stronger growth but also has a much cheaper valuation.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

However, Keybanc kept its \u201coverweight\u201d rating on NVDA stock this morning, citing the chipmaker\u2019s ability to profit from the rapid proliferation of AI.\nMeanwhile, other analyst firms have also been bullish on the shares of late. Here\u2019s what investor should know about NVDA stock right now.\nKeybanc and Other Firms Are Enthusiastic About Nvidia Stock\nKeybanc identified Nvidia as \u201ca top idea\u201d in a note to investors today.  The firm indicated that NVDA stock is attractive because Nvidia is \u201cindexed to [generative] AI.\u201d Meanwhile, Melius Research was also upbeat on NVDA this morning. According to the firm, Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell AI chip \u201ccould drive double-digit growth [\u2026] through 2025.\u201d Melius maintained a $1,000 price target and a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on shares of the chipmaker. \nFinally, just yesterday, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said that demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is still strong while the firm does not appear to have experienced order cancellations. Moreover, sales for its recently released offerings are rising.\n\u201cI\u2019ve covered Nvidia for a long time. We\u2019ve seen air pockets. The chance of an air pocket at some point is probably 100%. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s now,\u201d said Rasgon.\nOverall, according to MarketWatch, 88% of analysts have buy ratings on shares with an average price target of $989. \nThe Outlook for AI Chip Names\nBoding well for AI chip names, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) also reported very strong first-quarter results earlier this month and provided impressive full-year revenue guidance. Specifically, sales gained 16.5% year-over-year (YOY) while net income increased 9% YOY.\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects 2024 to be a \u201chealthy\u201d growth year, per CNBC. According to the company, its strong results and guidance were enabled by \u201cinsatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power.\u201d\n On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

There Are Big Holes in This Theory\n\n\n  \n      By Beth McKenna\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Apr 7, 2024 at 12:00PM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is led by a founder-CEO, while Cisco Systems' CEO in the late 1990s was not involved in starting the company. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's moat to keep competitors at bay is arguably higher than Cisco's moat in the late 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has largely grown organically, while Cisco heavily grew through acquisitions in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-1.69%)\u00a0-$2.02\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.50\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:53 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe similarities between Nvidia now and Cisco Systems in the late 1990s are only surface deep.\n\nRecently, I've spotted several article headlines warning Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) investors to be cautious because its stock's recent big run-up shares key similarities with Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.87%) stock's huge run-up in the 1990s before it crashed in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst. In just one year, Cisco stock plummeted 77% after hitting its all-time high on March 27, 2000.\nLet's dig into the qualitative reasons why the comparison of Nvidia now to Cisco in the late 1990s isn't a good one. A second article on this topic will focus on the quantitative reasons, including differences in profit margin trends and stock valuations.\nNvidia 2024 = Cisco Systems late 1990s theory has more holes than an AI supercomputer has GPUs\nThe above subheading is a reference to Nvidia's business -- and yes, it's an exaggeration because artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers can have thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia is the dominant maker of GPUs for accelerating the processing of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads in data centers. It has an estimated 90% share of the data center AI GPU chip market, and 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market. It also targets other markets, but its data center business is its largest, accounting for 83% of its revenue last quarter.\nTo be clear -- I'm not saying Nvidia stock is immune to a big decline or even a crash. No doubt, it would plunge if the company's GPUs lost their status as the favored chips for speeding up the training of AI models and the running of AI applications in data centers, and if it failed to develop whatever tech had displaced GPUs for these fast-growing uses. My premise is simply that the comparison of Nvidia now to Cisco in the late 1990s is not a good one. The similarities are only surface deep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey qualitative differences between Nvidia now and Cisco in the late 199Os\nCisco's CEO in the below chart refers to John Chambers, who led the company from 1995 to 2015.  Cisco was founded in 1984 by two Stanford University computer scientists and went public in 1990. \nNvidia has had only one CEO since its founding in 1993, co-founder Jensen Huang. The company went public in 1999.\n\n\n\nQualitative Metric\nCisco Systems Late 1990s\nNvidia Now\n\n\nRun by a founder-CEO?\nNo\nYes\n\n\nCEO educational background*\nBusiness (including an MBA) and legal\nElectrical engineering (including a master's degree)\n\n\nCEO work background*\n\n- Technology sales at IBM\n- VP of Operations at Wang Laboratories (a now-defunct computer company)\n\nMicroprocessor design for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\n\nCompany's primary growth driver\nInternet adoption and growth\nAI adoption and growth, particularly generative AI.*** (A notable secondary driver is the growth of computer gaming.)\n\n\nMain products\nInternet networking products (hardware and software) and services. Main hardware products in the 1990s included switches (LAN and WAN)**, access servers, and routers.\nPrimarily GPU chips and related hardware, software, and services. It also offers other chips, such as central processing units (CPUs) and a \"superchip,\" which is basically a combined CPU-GPU.\n\n\nCompetitive moat\nModerate-to-high overall\nHigh overall -- Its GPUs and associated hardware and software have a high degree of complexity.\n\n\nGrowth strategy\nConsiderable focus on acquisitions\nHeavily organic growth. Acquisitions have mainly been small, except for 2020's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox, which makes high-performance networking products.\n\n\n\n*According to public records. **LAN = local area network; WAN = wide area network. *** Generative AI is the tech behind OpenAI's extremely popular ChatGPT chatbot, released in late 2022.\nStudies support the theory that stocks of public companies run by founder-CEOs tend to perform better over the long term than those run by non-founders. Huang is a co-founder of Nvidia; Chambers was not involved in founding Cisco.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang's educational and work background before starting Nvidia was in electrical engineering and semiconductor design, respectively. These factors give him a major advantage over CEOs of technology companies whose backgrounds are not as technical, in my view.\nCisco's moat to keep competition at bay in the late 1990s was not as high as Nvidia's current moat. Nvidia's mighty moat isn't just due to the complexity of its products, but also stems from the fact that its ecosystem is huge and growing, thanks to its early mover status in the data center AI chip space. This ecosystem includes \"over 4.7 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets,\" the company said in its annual report filed in February. \nThe moat differences will be more evident in my second article on this topic focusing on quantitative factors. Suffice it to say here that Cisco's profit margins were steadily declining for a few years before its stock plunged. One main reason was competitive pressures on pricing. Nvidia's profit margins are currently at record highs.\nLet's move to the last category in the chart -- growth strategy. Cisco in the 1990s was a corporate equivalent of the iconic video game Pac-Man -- it devoured a lot of companies. From 1993 through July 2000, the company \"acquired or announced our intent to acquire 65 companies,\" it said in its fiscal year 2000 annual report. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, is mostly growing organically. Granted, it relatively recently made one huge acquisition, Mellanox, but it had already been growing at a robust pace before this deal. In other words, Nvidia didn't need to \"buy growth.\" And prior to this acquisition, Mellanox was a Nvidia partner, not a competitor, so it didn't buy the company in order to get rid of a competitor.\nGrowth strategies that heavily focus on acquisitions are very challenging to pull off successfully. They take the time and attention of top execs away from focusing on internal innovation. They eat up money that could be spent on research and development. In addition, it's difficult to meld different corporate cultures.\nNot surprisingly, Apple, one of the most successful and innovative companies of the last few decades, is known to prioritize organic growth.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Increased interest in AI services has meant an increased need for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary to train and run AI models.\nAs a result, the companies at the forefront of this technology, Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.52%), have enjoyed stock gains of 222% and 84%, respectively, since last April. These companies have exciting outlooks in AI over the long term thanks to their successful chip businesses, and they could profit from the market's tailwinds for years.\nThe AI market hit close to $200 billion last year and is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That trajectory would see the sector reach nearly $2 trillion by the decade's end. \nSo, despite their meteoric rises this year, the shares of Nvidia and AMD likely still have much to offer new investors over the long term. Let's look closer at these chipmakers and determine whether Nvidia or AMD is the better AI stock this April.\nNvidia\nIt's been hard to avoid coverage of Nvidia over the last year, as it became the poster child for the boom in AI. In 2023, the company cornered the market on AI chips, achieving an estimated 90% market share in GPUs, which sent its earnings skyrocketing. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn its fourth quarter of 2024 (which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The impressive growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike from AI.\n\nThe company's free cash flow increased by 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and retain its market supremacy. \nAs a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has a powerful position. Besides its AI hardware, the company's chips have a wide range of applications, including cloud platforms, video game consoles, laptops, custom-built PCs, and more.\nConsequently, the company is one of the best options for investing in tech, and even more so for those looking to profit from the future of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nAMD was slightly late to the AI party, and Nvidia beat it to the market. But AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in the coming years.\nLast December, AMD unveiled its MI300X GPU for AI. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia and has already led to some of tech's most prominent players, like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, to sign on as clients.\n\nAMD is diversifying by expanding into AI-powered personal computers (PCs). According to research firm IDC, shipments of PCs are projected to receive a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled. \nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in AI, but the company's recent quarterly report suggests it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia or AMD the better AI stock?\nNvidia and AMD are ready to profit from AI growth for decades. Both stocks would likely strengthen any portfolio over the long term. But earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates indicate AMD might have more room to run over the next two years.\n\nData by YCharts.\nThese charts show Nvidia's EPS could reach $36 by fiscal 2026, while AMD's might hit just over $7. On the surface, it looks like Nvidia is the clear winner. But multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (Nvidia's is 35 and AMD's is 47) yields stock prices of $1,260 for Nvidia and $329 for AMD. \nUsing their recent prices, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 44% over the next two fiscal years and AMD's increase by 93%. The significant difference highlights the fact that AMD is at an earlier stage in its AI journey and could have more room for growth in the short term. As a result, AMD is a screaming buy over Nvidia right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nVideo editors have more to look forward to than just April showers.\nBlackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve released version 19, adding the IntelliTrack AI point tracker and UltraNR AI-powered features to further streamline video editing workflows.\nThe NAB 2024 trade show is bringing together thousands of content professionals\u2028from all corners of the broadcast, media and entertainment industries, with video editors and livestreamers seeking ways to improve their creative workflows with NVIDIA RTX technology.\nThe recently launched Design app SketchUp 2024 introduced a new graphics engine that uses DirectX 12, which renders scenes 2.5x faster than the previous engine.\nApril also brings the latest NVIDIA Studio Driver, which optimizes the latest creative app updates, available for download today.\nAnd this week\u2019s featured In the NVIDIA Studio artist Rakesh created his captivating 3D scene The Rooted Vault using RTX acceleration.\nVideo Editor\u2019s DaVinci Code\nDaVinci Resolve is a powerful video editing package with color correction, visual effects, motion graphics and audio post-production all in one software tool. Its elegant, modern interface is easy to learn for new users, while offering powerful capabilities for professionals.\nTwo new AI features make video editing even more efficient: the IntelliTrack AI point tracker for object tracking, stabilization and audio panning, and UltraNR, which uses AI for spatial noise reduction \u2014 doing so 3x faster on the GeForce RTX 4090 vs. the Mac M2 Ultra.\nAll DaVinci Resolve AI effects are accelerated on RTX GPUs by NVIDIA TensorRT, boosting AI performance by up to 2x. The update also includes acceleration for Beauty, Edge Detect and Watercolor effects, doubling performance on NVIDIA GPUs.\nFor more information, check out the DaVinci Resolve website.\nSketchUp Steps Up\nSketchUp 2024 is a professional-grade 3D design software toolkit for designing buildings and landscapes, commonly used by designers and architects.\nThe new app, already receiving positive reviews, introduced a robust graphics engine that uses DirectX 12, which increases frames per second (FPS) by a factor of 2.5x over the previous engine. Navigating and orbiting complex models feels considerably lighter and faster with quicker, more predictable performance.\nIn testing, the scene below runs 4.5x faster FPS using the NVIDIA RTX 4090 vs. the Mac M2 Ultra and other competitors.\n2.5x faster FPS with the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. Image courtesy of Trimble SketchUp.\nSketchUp 2024 also unlocks import and export functionality for OpenUSD files to efficiently manage the interoperability of complex 3D scenes and animations across numerous 3D apps.\nGet the full release details.\nArt Rooted in Nature\nRakesh\u2019s passion for 3D modeling and animation stemmed from his love for gaming and storytelling.\n\u201cMy goal is to inspire audiences and take them to new realms by showcasing the power of immersive storytelling, captivating visuals and the idea of creating worlds and characters that evoke emotions,\u201d said Rakesh.\nHis scene The Rooted Vault aims to convey the beauty of the natural world, transporting viewers to a serene setting filled with the soothing melodies of nature.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-rakesh-kumar-wk105-breakdown-video-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nRakesh began by gathering reference material.\nThere\u2019s reference sheets \u2026 and then there\u2019s reference sheets.\nHe then used Autodesk Maya to block out the basic structure and piece together the house as a series of modules. GPU-accelerated viewport graphics ensured fast, interactive 3D modeling and animations.\nNext, Rakesh used ZBrush to sculpt high-resolution details into the modular assets.\nFine details applied in ZBrush.\n\u201cI chose an NVIDIA RTX GPU-powered system for real-time ray tracing to achieve lifelike visuals, reliable performance for smoother workflows, faster render times and industry-standard software compatibility.\u201d \u2014 Rakesh\n\nHe used the ZBrush decimation tool alongside Unreal Engine\u2019s Nanite workflow to efficiently create most of the modular building props.\nTraditional poly-modeling workflows for the walls enabled vertex blending shaders for seamless texture transitions.\nTextures were created with Adobe Substance 3D Painter. Rakesh\u2019s RTX GPU used RTX-accelerated light and ambient occlusion to bake and optimize assets in mere seconds.\nRakesh moved the project to Unreal Engine 5, where near-final finishing touches such as lighting, shadows and visual effects were applied.\nTextures applied in Adobe Substance 3D Painter.\nGPU acceleration played a crucial role in real-time rendering, allowing him to instantly see and adjust the scene.\nAdobe Premiere Pro has a vast selection of GPU-accelerated features.\nRakesh then moved to Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve to color grade the scene for the desired mood and aesthetic, before he began final editing in Premiere Pro, adding transitions and audio.\n\u201cWhile the initial concept required significant revisions, the final result demonstrates the iterative nature of artistic creation \u2014 all inspired by my mentors, friends and family, who were always there to support me,\u201d Rakesh said.\n3D artist Rakesh Kumar.\nCheck out Rakesh\u2019s latest work on Instagram.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, X and Facebook.

Its\u00a0run has been incredible. Since October 2022, NVDA stock has increased 695%. The company\u2019s share price has risen an astounding 1,765% over the last five years. The growth has pushed Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization to\u00a0above $2 trillion\u00a0and made it the third largest publicly traded company in the world after\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\u00a0Apple\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL).\nThe key to the success of NVDA stock has been the rising demand for the company\u2019s chips and semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence models and applications. The massive worldwide demand has led to a surge in Nvidia\u2019s sales and profits. For the final quarter of 2023, Nvidia reported that its\u00a0sales increased 265%\u00a0from a year earlier and its profits grew 769% year over year. The company\u2019s earnings reports have become a highly anticipated and closely watched event across the entire stock market.\u00a0\nSo who will be the next Nvidia? Which companies are positioned to steal its crown? Here are three\u00a0AI stocks\u00a0that will leave Nvidia in the dust.\u00a0\nMicron Technology (MU)\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comShares of\u00a0Micron Technology\u00a0(NASDAQ:MU) are running circles around Nvidia right now. MU stock has risen by 34% in the past month after the company announced financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance driven by AI demand. Micron, which makes memory and storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, announced in March earnings per share of 42 cents compared to a loss of 25 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.\n\t\t\n\n\nRevenue amounted to $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion, which was expected on Wall Street. Management said the company is benefitting from the\u00a0current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world. Looking ahead, executives said they expect to report revenue of $6.60 billion for the just-completed first quarter, which is above the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts.\nThanks to its post-earnings bounce, MU stock has now been up 55% since the start of this year and has more than doubled over the last 12 months.\u00a0\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD) is nipping at Nvidia\u2019s heels. One of its most direct competitors, AMD, as the company is known, has developed a series of microchips specifically for AI models and applications that it hopes will rival Nvidia\u2019s chips and semiconductors. Last December, AMD unveiled a new series of microchips called the \u201cRyzen 8040\u201d that are aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. Those new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs).\nAMD has also launched the new\u00a0MI300X accelerator microchip\u00a0that\u2019s used in data centers and servers and competes against Nvidia\u2019s AI data center chips. Companies ranging from\u00a0Meta Platforms\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) to Microsoft\u00a0have been buying up the MI300X chips, and AMD executives have said that they expect the data center microchips to generate $2 billion in sales for all of this year. The new AI microchips and decent earnings have AMD stock up 87% over the last 12 months, including a 30% gain so far in 2024.\u00a0\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)\nSource: ToyW / ShutterstockTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\u00a0(NYSE:TSM) is arguably the most important company to Nvidia and the entire AI industry. This is because TSMC, as the company is popularly known, makes three-quarters (75%) of the microchips in the world, including those designed by Nvidia, as well as nearly all the chips and semiconductors that power AI technologies. The growing importance of TSMC to the AI and chip industries has its\u00a0stock up by 52%\u00a0in the last year, including a 39% year-to-date gain.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\nDuring their most recent\u00a0earnings call, TSMC executives said that the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities, especially related to AI. Taiwan Semiconductor is increasingly focused on AI chips and semiconductors as it executes a global expansion plan. The company recently opened its first microchip plant in Japan, moving beyond its home market in Taiwan. It is also developing two new microchip plants in Arizona at a cost of $40 billion. TSM stock has more than tripled over the last five years.\u00a0\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.9%, notching its sixth consecutive losing day, and suffering its worst losing streak since October 2022. The benchmark index lost more than 3% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 2.1%, falling more than 5% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) managed to rise about 0.6%.  Disappointing earnings from Netflix (NFLX) weighed on hopes that quarterly reports would help revive the equity rally. Shares of the streaming giant, the first of the megacap techs to update, slid 9%. Technology stocks as a whole flashed red with all of the biggest names shedding value. Market darling Nvidia (NVDA) lost 10%, while Amazon (AMZN) saw a drop of more than 2%. Apple (AAPL) decreased 1%. The market had come back from a deeper sell-off after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran spooked traders overnight and spurred a rush to safe havens such as gold. But investors are still on high alert, though Iran has confirmed the drone attack and said it failed. Stocks were already under pressure before the shock amid persistent uncertainty about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. A growing number of Fed officials this week expressed a more hawkish stance because of hotter-than-anticipated inflation data in the first quarter. Meanwhile, US government bonds pulled back almost fully from their biggest rally of the year. The yield on the safe-haven 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell to trade around 4.6%. In commodities, Brent crude futures (BZ=F) \u2014 the global oil benchmark \u2014 traded around 0.2% higher to around $87 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) were up 0.5% to roughly $83 a barrel. Gold (GC=F) increases cooled a bit after earlier earlier gains, trading up 0.2%.

Sat, April 20, 2024 at 4:07 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  A look at the week ahead  When the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year, if it all, continues to dominate the storyline on Wall Street. While Big Tech has so far this year carried the broader market, there's less certainty that even solid earnings reports can keep the momentum going.Next week will provide another test of the tech sector's ability to push through an increasingly pessimistic narrative of higher interest rates for longer.Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are set to report, coming off of Netflix's (NFLX) disappointing showing. The streaming giant was the first of the megacap stocks to report, weighing on hopes that quarterly reports would help revive the equity rally.On the economic front, first quarter GDP is scheduled to publish on Thursday and another crucial inflation reading, the PCE price index is set to arrive on FridayYahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:   Sat, April 20, 2024 at 2:45 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Tesla's EV success made it 'Magnificent.' It could also be its downfall. If an autonomous future was one pillar supporting Tesla's (TSLA) \"Magnificent\" market valuation, an electric car cheap enough for most families was the other.But changes from inside the company and from outside forces are swiftly complicating that vision.Tesla's stock price is predicated in part on mass-market EVs and leading the paradigm shift in how most of the country gets around.But sky-high costs for autos \u2014 and especially EVs \u2014 have dampened consumer demand and extended any timelines for adoption.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)   Follow    View Quote Details    226.84 -11.17 (-4.69%)  As of 2:58:11 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart   While governments are set on steering society toward the electric transition, legacy automakers are recalibrating the timing as they adjust to the waning demand. Several big players, including Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), have recently scaled back their EV plans, while others are relying on hybrid vehicles to start the shift.Just as competitors are leaning into cheaper hybrids and better-selling gas models, Tesla appears to be pivoting away from its long-anticipated entry-level EV and entrenching its position as a luxury automaker.At the same time, resources for the affordable Model 2 EV project have now been allocated to a farfetched robotaxi plan.Against an increasingly pessimistic backdrop, the Model 2 was meant to be a shimmering answer to Tesla's short-term woes. But without a daring entry-level vehicle to reinvigorate Tesla's financials, the company's challenges seem less temporary. For some analysts and investors, Tesla doesn't have a future without the Model 2.The idea of driving without human intervention has played a crucial part in Tesla's tech-juiced growth story. But what if it's the only part?   Sat, April 20, 2024 at 2:00 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Rates staying higher for longer could be the new normal Surprisingly stubborn inflation has weighed heavily on markets in recent days. And a growing number of Fed officials are throwing cold water on the hopes that a rate cut will soon arrive. What was once a theory of interest rates staying higher for longer is looking more like a new normal.Current market wagers don't forecast a Fed rate cut until at least September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That's a long ways off from when most interest rate traders thought the easing cycle would begin. As recently as last month, the markets were projecting a June rate cut. But hotter-than-expected inflation readings have scrambled expectations.As Apollo Global Management\u2019s chief economist Torsten Slok notes, it typically takes eight months from the last Fed hike until the Fed starts cutting. But this cycle is different. The Fed has kept interest rates constant for ten months since the last hike in July 2023, Slok, said in a Friday note. (Disclosure: Apollo is Yahoo's parent company.)\"With easy financial conditions still giving a significant boost to inflation and growth over the coming quarters, the risks are rising that we could see a Fed cycle that is very different, with the Fed keeping rates higher for much longer than we usually see,\" he said.  Sat, April 20, 2024 at 1:33 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks trending in afternoon trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip leader was among a host of tech stocks losing ground on Friday afternoon with the semiconductor sector undergoing a correction as interest rate cut expectations dwindle. Nvidia lost more than 4% alongside other high-growth, technology-driven stocks.Procter & Gamble (PG): After topping quarterly earnings estimates and boosting guidance, shares of the consumer goods company fell by by 0.2% as investors focused on sales figures that fell short of expectations.Netflix (NFLX): Shares of the streaming giant fell 8 % after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.American Express (AXP): Shares of the financial services company gained almost 5% after releasing first quarter earnings that showed an 11% jump in revenue compared to the same period a year ago and beating Wall Street expectations. The credit card company also boasted that Gen Z and millennial customers accounted for more than 60% of new account acquisitions globally in the quarter.  Sat, April 20, 2024 at 12:37 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  The S&P 500 slips under the 5,000 mark Stocks moved mostly lower Friday afternoon as Big Tech stocks continued a sell-off that sent the S&P 500 back under the 5,000 mark.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.2%.   Sat, April 20, 2024 at 12:15 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Fed's Goolsbee says 'It makes sense to wait' before cutting rates Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee became the fourth Fed official this week to strike a more hawkish stance on interest rate policy, signaling that the first long-awaited rate cut might still be months away.Goolsbee said Friday that \"progress on inflation has stalled\" and that \"it makes sense to wait\" before cutting rates, Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports.The comments were notable because previously, Goolsbee had been one of the more dovish members of the Fed, known for his view that the Fed was on a \"golden path\" to getting inflation down without high unemployment.The most recent wave of greater caution started with Fed Chair Jay Powell, who said Tuesday that it will take \"longer than expected\" to achieve the confidence needed to get inflation down to the central bank\u2019s 2% target.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March showed inflation was hotter than expected for the third month in a row.\"You never want to make too much of any one month\u2019s data, especially inflation, which is a noisy series,\" Goolsbee said in remarks prepared for a speech before the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing's annual conference. \"But after three months of this, it can\u2019t be dismissed.\"\u201cRight now, it makes sense to wait and get more clarity before moving,\" he added.  Fri, April 19, 2024 at 11:55 PM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks trending in morning trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Shares of the server manufacturer slid more than 16% Friday morning after the company announced the date of its third quarter results but didn\u2019t offer a pre-announcement, which investors perceived as a negative signal, Wells Fargo Securities wrote.Netflix (NFLX): Shares of the streaming giant fell 7% after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.Paramount (PARA): The entertainment company rose 8% Friday morning following a report from\u00a0the New York Times revealing that Sony Pictures Entertainment (SONY) has entered talks with Apollo Global Management (APO), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, to discuss a possible joint buyout bid of Paramount. According to the report, both companies, through a joint venture, would offer cash for shares of Paramount, taking the company private.American Express (AXP): Shares of the financial services company gained almost 5% after releasing first quarter earnings that showed an 11% jump in revenue compared to the same period a year ago and beating Wall Street expectations. The credit card company also boasted that Gen Z and millennial customers accounted for more than 60% of new account acquisitions globally in the quarter.  Fri, April 19, 2024 at 10:38 PM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Apple pulls WhatsApp and Threads from China App Store Apple has removed WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China following a government order, citing national security concerns.The censorship demands to restrict access to some of the most popular messaging apps marks Beijing's latest effort to exert control through Apple's ecosystem. The move, Reuters reports, also signals a growing intolerance of China's central government toward foreign online messaging services and less leeway given to the iPhone maker to operate there.\"The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple said in a statement.China's Great Firewall blocks access to these apps, but they are still commonly used by Chinese users through virtual private networks that bypass the restrictions. As the Wall Street Journal reports, Beijing has raised concerns that the apps could be used by citizens to spread information that is otherwise censored by the government or to cause social unrest.   Fri, April 19, 2024 at 9:37 PM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks open mostly lower  The pressure forcing stocks downward mostly did not let up on Friday, as rising geopolitical tensions, disappointing earnings, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts weighed on Wall StreetThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2%.

And yes, inflation is still high, but it's not growing as fast. And the reality is, our consumers are going to spend.\"  Fri, April 19, 2024 at 6:01 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  Here's the most important point on Netflix Netflix (NFLX) shares are getting hit premarket after another big quarter on almost every line item.It makes sense; the stock was priced for perfection ahead of the report.But cutting through the noise, this point by Pivotal Research's Jeff Wlodarczak is the most important thing to take away on Netflix at this juncture:\"Netflix reported another high quality result with an across the board 1Q subscriber beat driven by core US and Euro markets and stronger than expected average revenue per user (successful 4Q price hikes in U.S./U.K./France) implying the ability to generate strong subscriber growth AND take price/expand margins, a powerful combo.\" With nothing in the report suggesting Netflix's fundamentals are struggling, you have to wonder if the pullback in the stock will be bought at the open today. One could make the argument that the stock isn't even that expensive compared to historical trading norms.Check out the current valuations on Netflix compared to those seen from 2016 to 2021, when the company was in no way as fundamentally strong as it is today. All data is presented to you, of course, by the Yahoo Finance platform.You can analyze more of this data on Netflix by heading to the statistics section on the Netflix ticker page.

The chip designer has knocked every earnings report out of the park since OpenAI unveiled the ChatGPT artificial intelligence (AI) tool, powered by the company's AI accelerator chips. Trailing sales are up by 126% in just five quarters. Free cash flow soared 610% higher over the same period, and Nvidia's stock price more than quadrupled.  Golf claps and finger snaps aplenty, please. Nvidia has made many investors a lot of money in this AI boom, including yours truly. But this isn't the right time to buy more Nvidia shares. The stock is trading at incredibly lofty valuation ratios as the company's investors bet it will continue to dominate the AI hardware arena for years to come. Since I'm not so sure about that, I recently took some Nvidia profits off the table to reinvest in some lower-priced but equally exciting growth stocks. You may not want to sell Nvidia stock today. In any case, I wouldn't recommend buying more of it right now. Due to Nvidia's inflated share price, I suggest you steer clear of buying this stock until it cools down a bit. But if you insist on buying AI stocks right now, take a closer look at digital design software veteran Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) and semiconductor pioneer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Autodesk's AI-driven strategy Autodesk is leaning into the AI opportunity. The company is already a leader in generative AI tools, particularly in the field of professional-quality 3D images. \"We can already generate 3D representations from images 10 times faster and with vastly higher quality than currently available 3D AI,\" CEO Andrew Anagnost said in February's fourth-quarter earnings report. To build on this industry-leading expertise, the company is rebuilding its core products around a shared, AI-driven design engine. The master plan is all about product lifecycle management, where a computer-aided design (CAD) can move from one team to another within each client's operating structure without running into red tape and speed bumps. At the same time, software improvements and new features created to serve one target market can easily find use cases across other customers and project types.  Again, Autodesk relies on high-quality machine learning and generative AI tools to deliver these planned efficiencies. These are early days in a \"multiyear process,\" and the upgrade path hasn't been smooth so far. Sales are growing but not skyrocketing. Free cash flow is down in recent quarters -- and Autodesk has delayed the filing of year-end financial documents, as auditors found inconsistencies in the fourth-quarter's cash-flow calculations.   Story Continues As a result, investors took a step back from the late paperwork issue, and Autodesk's stock is down 17% in the last month. It trades at 8.6x trailing sales and 36x free cash flow. That's a bargain next to Nvidia, with respective ratios of 33.8 and 76, respectively.Yes, Autodesk is growing slower than Nvidia right now, and I don't love the potentially flawed financial reporting. Still, I'm downright excited about the company's long-term business prospects as the modular, AI-powered software platform evolves.I bought my first Autodesk shares two years ago, as the industry veteran's stock looked undervalued from a long-term perspective. After a few wild swings, the stock price is back where it was in April 2022, but trailing sales are up by 20% and the AI catalyst should add more value over time.Intel's strategic shift toward AI and chipmaking servicesIntel's business model is also transforming. The company is still the leading name in PC and server processors, but Advanced Micro Devices is gaining ground in both markets. On the other hand, Intel taps into the AI boom from several angles, and the recently launched processor manufacturing business doubled its revenue in 2023.This ain't your grandfather's Chipzilla anymore. Some investors aren't comfortable with Intel's shifting strategy, expecting the company to defend its traditional processor business at all costs. But I would much rather own stock in a company willing to change with the times than watch an outdated titan sticking to its old guns. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid doesn't have a happy ending, y'know?The Intel Gaudi 2 may not be the fastest AI accelerator in the world, but AI system builders often don't look for maximum performance per chip. Intel delivers where it counts.\"Our Gaudi 2 AI accelerators continue to demonstrate price performance leadership compared to the most popular GPUs,\" CEO Pat Gelsinger said in January's earnings call. \"In a recent blog published by Databricks, Gaudi 2 was shown to clearly deliver the best training and inference performance per dollar based on public cloud pricing.\"Moreover, the next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator will launch later this year with quadruple the processing power and double the networking speed of the current chip.  Image source: Getty Images.  The Xeon line of server processors stands front and center in the AI systems market, too, since the supercomputers that train the beefiest large language models (LLMs) use these chips to control each accelerator module's data-crunching activities. Five of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world today rely on thousands of Intel Xeon processors. The largest one, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora system, even uses Intel GPUs instead of Nvidia's or AMD's. Those chip sales add up in a hurry when each processor costs at least $11,600.The new and improved Intel is a serious AI competitor, with important side gigs in traditional processor sales and semiconductor manufacturing. Intel is currently consuming cash due to costly upgrades and new construction of chipmaking facilities.

Here\u2019s Why the Stock Collapsed 10% in One DayNVDASMCIGSIllustration by NvidiaWall Street\u2019s biggest AI play erased $212 billion from its market cap as a broad-based selling wave swept Big Tech players. Key Points:Nvidia sheds 10% on Friday.  SMCI leads AI selloff with 23% drop.  Rush-hour earnings approaching fast.  Nvidia stock NVDA washed out more than 10% of its valuation, or $212 billion, on Friday, clocking out at a two-month low of $762 a share. It was the company\u2019s worst single-day plunge since the early days of Covid back in March 2020. Nvidia is at the top of the AI wave, and whenever something hits that trend, it\u2019s Nvidia taking in the initial shockwave.  Before Nvidia nosedived, its AI peer \u2014 Super Micro Computer SMCI \u2014 didn\u2019t report its preliminary earnings data as it usually does. The blunder was met with a sharp selloff and Super Micro, a highly revered AI play, shed 23% on the day. What\u2019s more, it threw off the entire AI trend, including Nvidia shares, as investors panicked over the frothy dynamics of the novel sector.  Still, analysts expect to see a solid earnings report by Nvidia. On deck to deliver figures on May 22, the favorite AI darling is projected to post profit growth of 38% in the first quarter compared to the first three months of 2023. Nvidia, which Goldman Sachs GS called \u201cthe most important stock on planet Earth,\u201d is up nearly 60% since the start of January, but down 20% from its record high.

The stock is up an incredible 561% since the start of 2023 and put on another 20.5% in the week to Friday morning, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The latest move comes after Vertiv released a stellar set of first-quarter earnings, which saw the company blast past management's expectations, raise full-year guidance, and report 60% growth in organic orders. Vertiv's growth momentum The company's growth is driven by data center spending and, in turn, by heavy investment in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. While it's become a favorite theme among investors, Vertiv has the order growth to back up the optimism. Here are a few highlights from the quarter: Organic sales up 8% to $1,639 million compared to guidance for a 5% organic increase. Adjusted operating profit of $249 million compared to guidance for $210 million. Full-year sales guidance raised to 12% organic growth from 10% previously. Full-year adjusted operating profit guidance raised to $1.35 billion from $1.3 billion.   Frankly, it's hard not to think management is being conservative with guidance. After all, the first-quarter adjusted operating profit beat internal expectations by $39 million, and organic orders grew at 60%. In comparison, management only raised its full-year adjusted operating profit by $50 million.   Image source: Getty Images.   More growth to come Moreover, CEO Giordano Albertazzi noted that \"most of the orders overage in Q1 is for deliveries beyond '24.\" As such, it's reasonable to expect investors to start penciling in significantly higher profits for 2025. Indeed, the stock received a slew of analyst upgrades in the days following the results, with analysts citing the early-cycle nature of the AI spending boom. Investors will hope they are correct; if they are, the stock will likely continue its remarkable run. Should you invest $1,000 in Vertiv right now?

And perhaps there's good reason for that. Despite the incredible returns Nvidia has delivered over the last couple of decades, the stock has also experienced some brutal sell-offs -- the most recent one, of course, beginning in late 2021 and ending about a year later.\n\nData by YCharts.\nIndeed, even with less-than-ideal timing during the last peak of the Nvidia hype cycle during the pandemic, investors still would have beaten the market. But who wants to buy and then promptly suffer a 70% decline?\nThus, three months into 2024, with Nvidia up more than 80% year to date, the question has resurfaced once again: Is it still time to buy Nvidia right now, or is it time to sell?\n\nTwo massive markets at Nvidia's command\nNvidia's epic stock performance is thanks to booming artificial intelligence (AI) system sales. However, its rise into the ranks of the world's most valuable companies (the \"Magnificent Seven\") might seem totally bonkers. Nvidia's market cap currently stands at nearly $2.3 trillion. That's remarkably high, even considering that Wall Street analysts expect its revenue to increase by another 80% or more this year to $110 billion and foresee generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share nearly doubling to $23, giving it a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 36. \n\n\n\n\n\nClearly, investors are betting Nvidia will stay in high-growth mode for quite some time. How unreasonable is that expectation, considering that the company's semiconductor-based sales have been cyclical in the past? Perhaps high growth for at least a few years isn't so crazy.\nCEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recently explained that his company is really at the forefront of two massive AI markets:\n\nThe world's existing data center market, valued roughly at $1 trillion, is in dire need of upgrades using accelerated computing hardware (like Nvidia's GPU systems) to meet the demands of new high-end software (like AI).\nThe new generative AI market needs purpose-built data centers to allow companies of all sorts to build customized AI systems using their proprietary data. \n\nThe existing and already-massive data center market tends to go through a full upgrade cycle about every four to five years. Hardware has a limited life span, and the steady pace of technological advancement requires old equipment to be replaced with higher-performance gear. Nvidia's GPU leadership makes it a natural fit to lead the way in the accelerated compute (AI) upgrade cycle.\nBut what of these new generative AI data centers, which Huang often calls \"AI factories\"? CEO Lisa Su of chip design rival AMD (AMD -0.52%) has said that total accelerated computing chip sales could reach $400 billion in 2027 alone. That's a lofty prediction, and one that includes not just generative AI factories but also upgrades to the existing data center market. But the trend is clear; generative AI is well on its way to becoming an industry worth tens of billions of dollars in annual sales all on its own. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's data center products have clearly been the standout victors in the space, headed toward $20 billion in quarterly revenue and beyond. Chip systems tend to be very sticky once they get installed into a data center. Intel (INTC 1.75%) is a case in point; its CPUs have dominated the data center market for decades (with an estimated market share of over 70%), even though companies like AMD have been offering compelling alternatives. Thus, this data center accelerated computing phenomenon could provide a natural path for Nvidia to earn itself lots of recurring (though still cyclical) hardware sales in the decades ahead. \n\nChart source: Nvidia.\n\nHow to handle Nvidia stock right now\nAs good as Nvidia's story is, at some point investors should brace for a big slowdown in accelerated computing growth or even a temporary contraction. That's just the way these things go.\nHowever, the timing of that cyclical slowdown is anyone's guess. All indicators point toward another banner year ahead for Nvidia in calendar 2024. Huang (and even some key suppliers for the GPU data center systems) have hinted that things are already looking pretty good for 2025. But it's simply too soon to say. \nFor investors who don't own Nvidia stock or those who feel like they don't own enough, history suggests patience will serve you well. For younger investors who have many years before they plan on drawing on their portfolios, rather than placing big sweeping bets on Nvidia at this point, consider firing up a small dollar-cost averaging (DCA) plan. If you do that, strap in and prepare to keep those regularly scheduled stock purchases going -- especially if Nvidia stock suffers a big decline.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor investors who already own ample amounts of Nvidia stock, and especially those who may not have so much time before they plan on using their money (perhaps for retirement), utilizing a reverse DCA approach in which they periodically sell small amounts of stock could help lock in some of their profits.\nAs spring gets rolling, though, Nvidia still appears to have a head of steam. As that continues, expect the investor frenzy to further heat up. But come what may, be resolute and keep a level head.\n\n\n\nNicholas Rossolillo and his clients have positions in Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

With so many sophisticated market participants and the wide availability of high-quality data on publicly traded companies, the probability of gaining an edge against the market as a whole has become vanishingly small. Nevertheless, for those who are lucky or perhaps smart enough to pull it off, the rewards from picking winners in the stock market can be impressive. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is one such winner. The GPUs Nvidia specializes in are especially useful in artificial intelligence applications, and with all the hype surrounding AI over the past few years, the company has seen extraordinary success. The five-year return on Nvidia stock is roughly 1,800% \u2014 an eye-popping figure.  While Nvidia may continue to enjoy this level of success, statistically, it\u2019s not very likely. It\u2019s simply difficult for a business to sustain that type of return over a long period of time. Investors looking for the next big thing may want to look away from recent winners.

With its Ryzen and EPYC processors, Advanced Micro Devices has been challenging industry giant Intel Corp. (INTC), while its Radeon graphics cards have been competing fiercely with Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Ace Zhuo, business development director for the trading technology hosting platform CheapForexVPS, believes Advanced Micro Devices is poised to benefit from the same tailwinds that have driven Nvidia\u2019s outsize returns.  \u201cAMD stands out for its remarkable strides in CPU and GPU markets, directly challenging industry giants. Their commitment to innovation and the increasing demand for high-performance computing and gaming technologies signal robust growth potential,\u201d Zhuo said. As the demand for computing power continues to grow, particularly in areas like cloud computing, gaming and data centers, Advanced Micro Devices is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver strong growth in the years ahead.

The rapid adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of data have created immense opportunities for companies like Snowflake,\u201d said Abid Salahi, co-founder of FinlyWealth.   Story Continues Snowflake is a cloud data platform that provides organizations with the ability to store, manage and analyze their data in a scalable and cost-effective manner. The company\u2019s platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and offers features such as data warehousing, data lakes and data sharing.With the explosive growth of data in today\u2019s digital world, there is a growing need for companies to effectively manage and derive insights from their data. Snowflake\u2019s platform addresses this need by providing a flexible and scalable solution that can handle large volumes of data from diverse sources. As organizations continue to prioritize data-driven decision making, Snowflake is poised to benefit from this trend and could see its stock price soar in the years ahead.Try This: If You Bought $1K of Elon Musk\u2019s Favorite Crypto 5 Years Ago, Here\u2019s How Much You Would Have Now  Omar Marques/SOPA Images / Shutterstock / Omar Marques/SOPA Images / Shutterstock  Datadog (DDOG)The second cloud computing company that Salahi recommended is Datadog, a monitoring and analytics platform that helps organizations gain insights into the performance of their applications and infrastructure. The company\u2019s platform collects and analyzes data from servers, databases, applications and other sources, allowing companies to identify and address issues before they impact their operations.With the shift to cloud computing and the increasing complexity of modern IT environments, the demand for monitoring and analytics solutions like Datadog\u2019s is growing rapidly. By providing real-time visibility into the health and performance of digital assets, Datadog helps companies improve their operational efficiency and deliver better customer experiences. As more organizations embrace digital transformation, Datadog is well positioned to benefit from this trend and could see its stock price soar in the years ahead.

This firm operates the largest ride-hailing and delivery platform across Southeast Asia, along with an offering of digital financial services. Grab has an expansive footprint in Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines, and its long-term growth potential is substantial, largely due to rising incomes and booming demand for digital services in its operating region,\u201d said Thomas Brock, CFA, CPA, an expert contributor at Annuity.org.With its diverse portfolio of services and strong market presence, Grab is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the digital economy in Southeast Asia. As more consumers in the region embrace digital services for transportation, food delivery and financial transactions, Grab stands to benefit from this trend and could see its stock price explode in the years ahead.  Celsius Holdings (CELH)Celsius Holdings is a leading manufacturer and distributor of functional beverages, including energy drinks and fitness drinks. The company\u2019s flagship product, Celsius, is marketed as a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks, with its proprietary blend of ingredients designed to boost metabolism and provide sustained energy without the crash or jitters.\u201cEnergy drinks have long been popular, and Celsius is now profitable as it expands into international markets. Its partnership with giant PepsiCo means it\u2019s likely to keep its upward trend,\u201d said Scott Lieberman, founder of Touchdown Money. As the company continues to expand its distribution network and introduce new products, it could see significant growth in its revenue and profitability, driving its stock price higher in the years ahead.More From GOBankingRatesShould You Buy Groceries at the Dollar Store? 5 Japanese Cars To Stay Away From Buying The 6 Smartest Things to Do With Your Tax Refund 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: In 5 Years, These 5 Stocks Could Explode Like Nvidia Did  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

As a result, Nvidia's stock has advanced, too, posting a gain of more than 200% over the past year. The company continues to pour investment into research and development, so it's very likely this industry star will stay in the lead.\n\nIt's no surprise that investors continue to pile into Nvidia stock, betting on more gains ahead, possibly in the near term and well into the long term. But is this stock really the best investment for you?\nAfter all, even if Nvidia remains in the lead, the stock may not replicate its past performance. Momentum could slow, or the stock's performance may stagnate as investors turn to other tech players ripe for an increase. So investing in Nvidia at this stage and hoping for enormous gains comes with some risk.\nYou have another option if you're looking for growth and hoping to score a win from the AI boom, though, and that's investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds shares of Nvidia and other technology players. One in particular, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX -0.82%), has proven its strength in recent times. Should you buy Nvidia or this high-growth ETF?\u00a0\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nConsider the expense ratio\nFirst, let's talk a bit about ETFs. These funds own shares of companies in a particular index or industry and trade like stocks, so you can buy them like you would a stock. But they come with an additional cost that's linked to the management of the particular fund. This is known as the expense ratio. It's best to select a fund with an expense ratio of 1% or less to limit your costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of investing in an ETF rather than in just one or a few stocks is it offers you exposure to a whole basket of stocks within a particular theme -- such as semiconductor companies, in this case. Your investment probably won't soar in the triple digits in a short period of time as certain individual stocks have done, but it's also less likely to sink in a short period because it doesn't depend on the performance of just one player. So it's a safer way to invest in a high-growth area such as technology or, more specifically, chip companies.\nNow let's consider the iShares Semiconductor ETF, versus an investment in Nvidia. The iShares Semiconductor has an expense ratio of 0.35%, so it fits our investment criteria. Its biggest holding is Nvidia, so it offers you exposure to this star player, and chip giants Advanced Mico Devices and Intel are within the top five positions. The ETF includes 30 holdings -- 78% are semiconductor companies and the rest are semiconductor equipment makers.\nOutperforming the Nasdaq\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF has outperformed the Nasdaq over the past year, though it has greatly underperformed Nvidia.\n\nSOXX data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering we're in the early stages of AI and analysts forecast the AI market will surpass $1 trillion by 2030, this ETF could continue to soar well into the future and even beat the Nasdaq. But it may not beat Nvidia or any other single stock that attracts the market's attention.\nNow let's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia or this high-growth ETF? This depends on your comfort with risk and your investment strategy.\nIf your portfolio already includes a diversified selection of technology stocks -- including semiconductor players -- and you're an aggressive investor, you may want to buy Nvidia and bet on the company's next wave of growth. After all, it's preparing to launch the much-awaited Blackwell platform later this year, and that could drive more gains in earnings and share performance.\nBut if you're a cautious investor or haven't yet invested much in semiconductors, it's best to diversify instead of betting on just one player. The iShares Semiconductor ETF allows you to do just that, offering you exposure to all the top players right away and the ticket to benefit from their growth today and over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Here\u2019s What It Means.ByRobert Pearl, M.D., Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Dr. Robert Pearl covers the people, tech and business of healthcare.Follow AuthorApr 17, 2024, 04:30am EDTShareSaveCommentNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference ... [+] at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California.Getty Images\nSoon after Apple released the original iPhone, my father, an unlikely early adopter, purchased one. His plan? \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in the trunk for emergencies,\u201d he told me.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t foresee that this device would eventually replace maps, radar detectors, traffic reports on AM radio, CD players, and even coin-operated parking meters\u2014not to mention the entire taxi industry.\n\n\nHis was a typical response to revolutionary technology. We view innovations through the lens of what already exists, fitting the new into the familiar context of the old.\n\nGenerative AI is on a similar trajectory. In my new book, ChatGPT, MD, I envisioned AI tools becoming hubs of medical expertise for doctors and patients within the next five years.\n\nI feared my optimism about the technology was too ambitious, but by the time my book published last week, I realized my estimated timeline might have been too conservative.\nIn March, Nvidia stunned the tech and healthcare industries with a flurry of headline-grabbing announcements at its 2024 GTC AI conference. The most striking being a collaboration between Nvidia and Hippocratic AI to launch generative AI \u201cagents.\u201d\n\nAccording to company-released data, the AI bots are 16% better than nurses at identifying a medication\u2019s impact on lab values, 24% more accurate detecting toxic dosages of over-the-counter drugs, and 43% better at identifying condition-specific negative interactions from OTC meds. All that at $9 an hour compared to the $39.05 median hourly pay for U.S. nurses. These AI nurse-bots are designed to make new diagnoses, manage chronic disease, and give patients a detailed but clear explanation of clinicians\u2019 advice.\nThese rapid developments suggest we are on the cusp of a technology revolution, one that could reach global ubiquity far faster than the iPhone. Here are three major implications for patients and medical practitioners:\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\n1. GenAI In Healthcare Is Coming Faster Than You Can Imagine\nThe human brain can easily predict the rates of arithmetic and geometric growth.\n\nBut even the most astute minds struggle to grasp the implications of continuous, exponential growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re witnessing with generative AI.\nImagine, for example, a pond with just one lily pad. Assuming the number of lilies will double every night, the entire pond will be covered in just 50 days. Yet, on day 43, you would see only 1% of the pond\u2019s surface covered. It seems hard to believe that just seven days later, the lily pads will completely fill the pond.\n\n\nExperts project that AI\u2019s computational progress will double roughly every year, if not faster. But even with conservative projections, ChatGPT and similar AI tools are poised to be 32 times more powerful in five years and over 1,000 times more powerful in a decade. That\u2019s equivalent to your bicycle traveling as fast as a car and then, shortly after, a rocket ship.\nThis rate of advancement proves challenging for both healthcare providers and patients to understand, but it means that now is the time to prepare for what\u2019s coming.\n2. GenAI Is Vastly Different Than Past AI Models\nWhen assessing the transformative potential of generative AI in healthcare, it\u2019s crucial not to let past failures, such as IBM\u2019s Watson, cloud our expectations. IBM set out ambitious goals for Watson, hoping it would revolutionize healthcare by assisting with diagnoses, treatment planning and interpreting complex medical data for cancer patients.\nI was highly skeptical at the time, not because of the technology itself, but because Watson relied on data from electronic medical records, which lack the accuracy needed for \u201cnarrow AI\u201d to make reliable diagnoses and recommendations.\nIn contrast, generative AI leverages a broader and more useful array of sources. It not only pulls from published, peer-reviewed medical journals and textbooks but also will be able to integrate real-time information from global health databases, ongoing clinical trials and medical conferences. It will soon incorporate continuous feedback loops from actual patient outcomes and clinician input. This extensive data integration will allow generative AI to continuously stay at the forefront of medical knowledge, making it fundamentally different from its predecessors.\nThat said, generative AI will require a couple more generational upgrades before it can be widely used without direct clinician oversight. Still, Nvidia\u2019s bold entry into healthcare signals a long-overdue willingness among tech companies to navigate the legal and regulatory hurdles of healthcare. Once an AI clinician chatbot is available, multiple other companies will quickly follow.\n3. GenAI In Healthcare Will Be Ubiquitous (Hospital, Office, Home)\nJust as my father never imagined his iPhone (stored in the trunk) would evolve into an essential tool for navigating life, many Americans struggle to envision the transformative impact that generative AI will have on healthcare.\nThe concept of accessing medical advice and expertise continuously, affordably, reliably, and conveniently around the clock represents such a departure from current healthcare models that it\u2019s easy for our minds to dismiss it as far-fetched. Yet it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that these capabilities are not just possible, but likely and even imminent.\nDaily, I receive feedback from both clinicians and patients who have interacted with generative AI tools. The majority report that the responses, particularly when prompted effectively, align closely with clinician recommendations. This is a testament to the evolving accuracy and reliability of generative AI in healthcare settings, and it promises a revolution in medical care delivery in the near future.\nA decade from now, we will look back at today\u2019s skepticism in much the same way I think about my dad\u2019s initial underestimation of his iPhone. We are on the cusp of a major shift, where generative AI will become as integral to healthcare as smartphones have become to daily life.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Notably, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have seen significant changes in their price targets from top financial institutions.\nWhat Happened: Morgan Stanley has taken a bullish position on Nvidia, adjusting its price target upwards with an anticipation of over 15% growth, CNBC reported on Wednesday. In contrast, Jefferies has revised its 12-month forecast for Tesla downward, suggesting a potential decline of nearly 7% in the electric vehicle manufacturer\u2019s share value.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Joseph Moore has set Nvidia\u2019s price target at $1,000, up from $795, attributing this optimism to strong demand and pricing power in the semiconductor space. Moore specifically pointed to Nvidia\u2019s Data Center segment as a primary growth catalyst, driven by increasing needs for AI/ML hardware.\nConversely, Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois maintained a hold rating on Tesla but reduced the price target to $165 from $185. Houchois cited internal challenges and softening sales in China as key factors for the tempered expectations.\nSee Also: Tesla Decision To Pause $25,000 Vehicle Could Be \u2018Thesis-Changing\u2019: Analyst Looks For Clarity On Robotaxi\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters: These revised analyst targets come at a time when Nvidia\u2019s stock has been under scrutiny.  Nvidia shares dipped ahead of inflation data release and news of a major tech company planning to produce AI chips in-house, potentially impacting Nvidia\u2019s market share.\nAdditionally, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Investment Management sold a substantial portion of Nvidia shares, signaling a shift in investor sentiment towards the AI giant.\nFor Tesla, the price target adjustment by Jefferies follows Goldman Sachs\u2019 view that delaying Tesla\u2019s $25K EV would negatively impact the stock. This comes after Tesla reported lower-than-expected production and delivery numbers for the first quarter of 2024, contributing to the bearish outlook.\nRead Next: NASDAQ-Listed Marijuana Stocks, Tilray, Canopy, Aurora Rally: What\u2019s Behind The Surge?\nImage via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by \nPooja Rajkumari\n\n\n\n\n            The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n            Learn more.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTesla NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nBYD Company shocks the electric vehicle sector with a 5-minute charging breakthroughSeeking Alpha 2h \n\n\n\n4 reasons why Tesla's 53% stock crash is accelerating todayBusiness Insider 3h \n\n\n\nCan Tesla attract conservative EV buyers amid the global backlash trend?Seeking Alpha 7h \n\n\n\nBYD claims new technology charges EVs in 5 minutes, CNBC reportsTipRanks 7h \n\n\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Stock Price Plunge Nets $16B for Short Sellers \u00a0TipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nTesla fundamentals continue to soften, says OppenheimerTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nTesla rival Zeekr rolling advanced driver-assistance capabilities, CNBC saysTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nTesla management to meet with Cantor FitzgeraldTipRanks 9h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n117.11\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.42 (-2.02%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t02:57:43 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTSLA\n\n\n\n226.86\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-11.15 (-4.68%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t02:57:43 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time TSLA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Is the Chip Giant\u2026ImportantExclusiveNVDA: Nvidia Stock Drops 10% from Record High. Is the Chip Giant Losing Its Grip?NVDAAAPLMSFTMETANVIDIAAI-focused company has lost about $200 billion in market cap in the past two weeks and permabears can finally say \u201ccalled it.\u201d Key Points:Nvidia shares drop 10% from peak.  Traders brace for earnings season.  Chip giant still third at the top.  Nvidia stock NVDA tumbled 2% on Tuesday to clock out of the session at $853.38 a share. The drop added to growing pains for the chip giant whose valuation has taken a big hit over the past two weeks. About $200 billion, or 10%, has been wiped out for that time span.  It\u2019s a victory for the permabears among us who have been calling for a bubble since Nvidia was trading at $300. But is that retreat a healthy pullback before the company\u2019s earnings report, due May 22, or is it something more? It depends who you ask. Nvidia is still holding the third spot among the world\u2019s biggest companies, right after Apple AAPL, $2.6 trillion, and Microsoft MSFT, $3.1 trillion.  Nvidia\u2019s formidable rise has left all other big tech heavyweights in the dust this year. With yesterday\u2019s drop factored in, shares are still up nearly 80% on the year.

Nvidia's stock surged more than 230% as the explosive growth of the AI market drove more companies to upgrade their data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks. Meanwhile, Meta's stock rallied nearly 140% as the growth of its advertising business accelerated again.\nBut should investors still buy either of these high-growth tech stocks today?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is still firing on all cylinders\nNvidia once generated most of its revenue by selling discrete GPUs for gaming PCs. But over the past few years, the chipmaker rolled out higher-end GPUs for accelerating machine learning and AI tasks at data centers.\nThat move gave it a firm foothold in the growing AI market, and its sales of data center GPUs soared and eclipsed it sales of gaming GPUs. It generated 78% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January) from data center GPUs.\n\nIts revenue soared 126% that year as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 288%. That marked an astonishing acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% adjusted EPS decline in fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of its growth was driven by the rising popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms, which prompted more companies to buy its data center GPUs to upgrade their own AI capabilities. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC market recovered.\nIn fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 81% and 89%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand. Based on those expectations, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued at 37 times forward earnings. Its smaller rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which is growing at a slower rate, trades at 49 times forward earnings.\nNvidia remains the top seller of shovels and picks for this AI gold rush, but investors shouldn't ignore the longer-term threats. AMD is already rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, major customers like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google are developing their own first-party AI chips, and other major chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm are teaming up to develop an open source alternative to Nvidia's closed-source CUDA programming platform. All of these challenges could prevent Nvidia from monopolizing the booming market for AI accelerator chips.\nMeta is recovering from a tough slowdown\nMeta served 3.98 billion monthly active people across its entire family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) at the end of 2023. But back in 2022 its revenue and EPS fell 2% and 38%, respectively. That slowdown was caused by Apple's privacy changes on iOS (which disrupted its ability to mine data from third-party apps), tough competition from ByteDance's TikTok and other social media apps, and the macro headwinds for digital ads.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Meta's advertising business sputtered out, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment, which houses its virtual and augmented reality devices. That mix of slowing revenue growth and rising expenses spooked the bulls.\n\nBut in 2023 Meta's revenue and adjusted EPS grew 16% and 73%, respectively. It successfully countered Apple's changes by collecting more first-party data with its AI algorithms, kept pace with TikTok by expanding its Reels short video platform, and attracted more ad dollars from Chinese gaming and e-commerce companies that were targeting overseas consumers. Those Chinese advertisers accounted for 10% of Meta's total revenue for the year.\nMeta continued to expand its Reality Labs division, yet it still generated enough cash to initiate its first dividend and raise its current buyback authorization by $50 billion. Those confident moves suggested that brighter days were ahead, and analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise 17% and 35%, respectively, in 2024. It could even easily exceed those estimates if the U.S. government finally bans its top competitor TikTok this year.\nMeta's stock looks reasonably valued at 25 times forward earnings, but its growth could be throttled by other longer-term challenges. The Chinese advertisers that bought so many ads across its apps in 2023 could abruptly rein in their spending. TikTok might dodge a ban in the U.S. and ramp up the pressure on Instagram and Reels again, and Meta still needs to deal with several unresolved antitrust and privacy investigations in the U.S. and Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe better buy: Nvidia\nBoth of these Magnificent Seven stocks are solid long-term investments. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd buy Nvidia instead of Meta for three simple reasons: It's growing a lot faster, it has a wider moat, and it doesn't look overvalued relative to its growth potential yet. Meta will remain the 800-pound gorilla of social media for the foreseeable future, but it will also likely face significantly more macroeconomic, competitive, and regulatory headwinds than Nvidia.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Check Out: 10 Valuable Stocks That Could Be the Next Apple or AmazonRead Next: 6 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money  Yet, while 2024 was off to a good start for the group, some stocks are starting to lag, making some wonder whether the Magnificent Seven is now down to a \u201cfab four,\u201d as The Wall Street Journal reported. In particular, Nvidia and Tesla now seem to be on very different trajectories. Sponsored: Protect Your Wealth With A Gold IRA. Take advantage of the timeless appeal of gold in a Gold IRA recommended by Sean Hannity. Tesla Stock Analysis Year-to-date: down 31.5% as of April 5. Past year: down 8.3% as of April 5. Past month: down 5.9% as of April 5.  Tesla announced its first quarter deliveries on April 2, which was \u201can unmitigated disaster,\u201d according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. \u201cWe view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance. Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative,\u201d Ives wrote in an April 2 note.  CFRA Research indicated in an April 2 note that it maintained its Buy opinion on Tesla.\u00a0However, it cut its 12-month target by $15, to $220. \u201cDespite near-term headwinds, we continue to regard Tesla as one of the market\u2019s most compelling long-term growth stories and the stock appears to be fully discounting various issues surrounding the name after a precipitous YTD drop,\u201d CFRA equity analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in the note.

Past year: up 226.3% as of April 5. Past month: up 2% as of April 5.  Nvidia on the other hand \u2014 \u201cthe most important stock on the planet\u201d \u2014 delivered record-breaking earnings on Feb. 21, with revenue rising to $22.1 billion. This figure is up 265% from a year ago, according to the earnings report, largely thanks to its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) business. This is what some analysts, such as Ives, deemed \u201cthe biggest moment for the market and tech sector in many years,\u201d and a \u201cgame changing moment for the tech bulls,\u201d as GOBankingRates previously reported. CFRA Research has a Buy view on the stock, reflecting its \u201coptimism surrounding NVDA\u2019s pipeline and unprecedented demand for cloud infrastructure spend in favor of NVDA\u2019s offerings,\u201d according to an April 3 research note.   Story Continues \u201cWe see sales rising 80% in FY 25 (Jan.) and 20% in FY 26 after a 126% increase for FY 24,\u201d CFRA Research equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote in the note.More From GOBankingRatesRare Bicentennial Quarter Has Nearly $20K Value -- Plus 7 More Worth Big Money 10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle This is One of the Best Ways to Boost Your Retirement Savings in 2024 6 Things You Should Never Do With Your Tax Refund (Do This Instead) This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Nvidia vs. Tesla Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study NVIDIA's  ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.  Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  How Do You Calculate Return On Equity? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is: 69% = US$30b \u00f7 US$43b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.69 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 69% ROE First thing first, we like that NVIDIA has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 14% which is quite remarkable. As a result, NVIDIA's exceptional 39% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NVIDIA's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 29% in the same period, which is great to see.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Past Earnings Growth April 17th 2024   Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.   Story Continues Is NVIDIA Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?NVIDIA's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.2%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 95% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, NVIDIA has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.5% over the next three years. However, NVIDIA's future ROE is expected to decline to 53% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Terms of the deal aren\u2019t being disclosed publicly, but two sources close to the matter tell TechCrunch that the price tag was $700 million.\nCTech reported earlier this morning the companies were in \u201cadvanced negotiations\u201d that could see Nvidia pay upwards of $1 billion for Run:ai. Evidently, the negotiations went off without a hitch, apart from a possible price change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia says that it\u2019ll continue to offer Run:ai\u2019s products \u201cunder the same business model\u201d and invest in Run:ai\u2019s product roadmap as part of Nvidia\u2019s DGX Cloud AI platform, which gives enterprise customers access to compute infrastructure and software that they can use to train models for generative and other forms of AI. Nvidia DGX server and workstation and DGX Cloud customers will also gain access to Run:ai\u2019s capabilities for their AI workloads, Nvidia says \u2014 particularly for generative AI deployments running across multiple data center locations.\u00a0\n\u201cRun:ai has been a close collaborator with Nvidia since 2020 and we share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,\u201d Omri Geller, Run:ai\u2019s CEO, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to join Nvidia and look forward to continuing our journey together.\u201d\nGeller co-founded Run:ai with Ronen Dar several years ago after the two studied together at Tel Aviv University under professor Meir Feder, Run:ai\u2019s third co-founder. Geller, Dar and Feder sought to build a platform that could \u201cbreak up\u201d AI models into fragments that run in parallel across hardware, whether on-premises, in public clouds or at the edge.\nWhile Run:ai has few direct competitors, other companies are applying the concept of dynamic hardware allocation to AI workloads. For example, Grid.ai offers software that allows data scientists to train AI models across GPUs, processors and more in parallel.\nBut relatively early in its life, Run:ai managed to establish a large customer base of Fortune 500 companies \u2014 which in turn attracted VC investments. Prior to the acquisition, Run:ai had raised $118 million in capital from backers including Insight Partners, Tiger Global, S Capital and TLV Partners.\n\nIn the blog post, Alexis Bjorlin, Nvidia\u2019s VP of DGX Cloud, noted that customer AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex and that there\u2019s a growing desire among companies to make more efficient use of their AI computing sources.\nA recent survey of organizations adopting AI from ClearML, the machine learning model management company, found that the biggest challenge in scaling AI for 2024 so far has been compute limitations in terms of availability and cost, followed by infrastructure issues.\n\u201cManaging and orchestrating generative AI, recommender systems, search engines and other workloads requires sophisticated scheduling to optimize performance at the system level and on the underlying infrastructure,\u201d Bjorlin said. \u201cNvidia\u2019s accelerated computing platform and Run:ai\u2019s platform will continue to support a broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, giving customers choice and flexibility. Together with Run:ai, Nvidia will enable customers to have a single fabric that accesses GPU solutions anywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun:ai is among Nvidia\u2019s biggest acquisitions since its purchase of Mellanox for $6.9 billion in March 2019.\n\n\nTopics\n\nacquisition, AI, AI, Mergers and Acquisitions, nvidia, Run:AI, startup, Startups \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tKyle Wiggers\t\n\n\n\nAI Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tKyle Wiggers is TechCrunch\u2019s AI Editor.

Check Out These 7 AI Stocks InsteadByCatherine BrockShareSaveCommentMoneyMissed Nvidia\u2019s Stock Price Rally? Check Out These 7 AI Stocks InsteadByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Catherine Brock covers personal finance and investing. for\u00a0Investor HubFollow AuthorApr 26, 2024, 08:59am EDTUpdated Mar 4, 2025, 09:56am ESTShareSaveCommentgetty\nA year ago, you could have bought semiconductor stock Nvidia (NVDA) for about $277 per share. Today, the price is above $800. Investors, eager to capitalize on the company's momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, have driven NVDA up some 188%.\n\n\nAI has been a topic of interest for investors since ChatGPT took the technology mainstream in late-2022. Since then, Nvidia has monetized AI more dramatically than any other public company. That's great news for those who bought Nvidia stock before the end of 2023. The rest of us, sadly, missed the rally.\n\nFortunately, the AI revolution is just getting started. Let's get motivated for AI investing redemption with a quick look at Nvidia's recent trajectory, followed by an introduction to seven top AI stocks with double-digit upside.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Stock Price Rally\nNvidia's amazing rally over the past year had several catalysts. To start, the company reported four consecutive earnings surprises, ranging from 17% to 44%. Nvidia also grew its EPS from $0.88 in the April, 2023 quarter to $4.91 in the January, 2024 quarter.\n\nThe tech stock tripled in 2023, and then hit its steepest climb in January 2024. In that month, Nvidia announced graphics cards designed for use in \"AI-ready\" laptops and released its AI Workbench developer toolkit to beta. AI Workbench streamlines the creation and deployment of AI applications. Analysts responded to the new product splash by increasing their NVDA price targets and ratings.\nBy the time Nvidia announced 486% growth in its adjusted, diluted EPS between the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024, the stock price had already eclipsed $700. After the last earnings release, NVDA climbed to $950 before moderating back to about $800.\n\nEven at $800, the prevailing opinion is that the stock has already priced in investors' strong expectations for future AI-related growth.\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download Forbes' most popular report, 12 Stocks To Buy Now.\n7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Check Out Instead\nNvidia may have been the first to capitalize on AI enthusiasm, but it won't be the last. The table below introduces seven stocks that are well-positioned to benefit from growing AI adoption.\nTable data sources: Morningstar, Tradingview. \n1. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)\nHere's a look at TSM by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $127.38\nTrailing 12 months' (TTM) adjusted, diluted EPS: $163.69\nProjected upside: 19%\nDividend yield: 1.3%\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Overview\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest contract manufacturer of semiconductor chips.\nWhy TSM Is A Top Choice\nTSM enjoys an almost unshakeable market share, owning roughly 61% of global semiconductor production. Its customer list includes several companies with strong AI exposure in their own right, including Nvidia, Apple\nApple\n, Advanced Micro Devices\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n and Qualcomm\nQualcomm\n.\nAs the world collectively demands better, faster computing chips, TSM will benefit. The company is gearing up for future growth with production capacity expansion efforts in Japan and the United States.\nTSM pays a reasonable dividend yield of 1.3%, which is uncommon among AI stocks. You can also find TSM on my list of best stocks for 2024.\n2. Tencent Holdings (TCEHY)\nHere's a look at TCEHY by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $40.83\nTTM adjusted, diluted EPS: $12.42\nProjected upside: 29%\nDividend yield: 0.7%\n\nTencent Holdings Overview\nChina-based Tencent Holdings operates a collection of businesses that provide online advertising, streaming entertainment, fintech and business services.\nWhy TCEHY Is A Top Choice\nTencent debuted its generative AI product, called Hunyuan, last year. Like ChatGPT, Hunyuan is a general-purpose technology, but the company is positioning it as a platform for business-related AI applications.\nIn fiscal year 2023, Tencent grew revenues by 10% and operating profit by 24%. The company has momentum in the gaming side of its business, but an upgrade to its AI-powered ad tech platform was also a factor in the revenue growth.\nTencent pays a modest dividend and regularly repurchases its shares.\n3. ServiceNow\nServiceNow\n\nHere's a look at NOW by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $711.69\nTTM adjusted, diluted EPS: $8.42\nProjected upside: 20%\nDividend yield: NA\n\nServiceNow Overview\nServiceNow develops and maintains a cloud-based workflow automation platform that businesses use to manage technology, operations, customer experience and human resources.\nWhy NOW Is A Top Choice\nServiceNow is delivering generative AI capabilities to its business customer base within its core Now platform. Those capabilities include the automation of repetitive tasks, identification of similarities across open tickets, work routing, recommendations for knowledge base content improvements and more.\nThose features, collectively called Now Assist, are resonating with customers. In the quarter after Now Assist launched, ServiceNow reported 25.5% growth in subscription revenues and 15% growth in its customer base. It was the largest net increase in annual contract value associated with any product release in the company's history.\nStop chasing shadows in the market.

Synopsys\nSynopsys\n\nHere's a quick look at SNPS by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $511.47\nTTM adjusted, diluted EPS: $8.95\nProjected upside: 25%\nDividend yield: NA\n\nSynopsys Overview\nSynopsys makes software plus related tools and services used in the design and testing of silicon chips.\nWhy SNPS Is A Top Choice\nSynopsys' software stack for chip design, called Synopsys.ai, uses generative AI to streamline the design process. At the company's annual user group conference, CEO Sassine Ghazi said Synopsys.ai usage was growing rapidly on the strength of positive customer outcomes. The platform is delivering up to 10 times faster turnaround times plus a 10%-plus increase in performance, power and area\u2014key variables in the optimization of chip design.\nIn its most recent earnings release, SNPS reported record revenue of $1.65 billion, representing a 21% gain over the prior-year result.\n5. Crowdstrike (CRWD)\nHere's a quick look at CRWD by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $282.64\nTTM adjusted, diluted EPS: $0.37\nProjected upside: 41%\nDividend yield: NA\n\nCrowdstrike Overview\nCrowdstrike delivers AI-powered cybersecurity solutions and workflow automation, primarily on a subscription basis, for businesses in the U.S. and around the world.\nWhy CRWD Is A Top Choice\nCrowdstrike went public in 2019 and has only recently delivered GAAP profits. When the company reported positive EPS in the quarters ending April and July 2023, analysts and investors were pleasantly surprised.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Crowdstrike reported 33% increases in total revenues and subscription revenues and a 34% increase in annual recurring revenue. Momentum in recurring revenue bodes well for the future, given the company's 78% gross margin on subscriptions.\nCrowdstrike is guiding to roughly $3.9 billion in revenues and $3.77 to $3.97 in adjusted, diluted net income per share for fiscal year 2025. Those numbers translate to revenue growth of about 27% and earnings growth of at least 22%.\n6. Marvell Technology\nMarvell Technology\n\nHere's a quick look at MRVL by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $61.90\nTTM adjusted, diluted EPS: $1.51\nProjected upside: 43%\nDividend yield: 0.4%\n\nMarvell Technology Overview\nMarvell Technology designs integrated semiconductors for use in data centers across multiple end markets.\nWhy MRVL Is A Top Choice\nFor its fiscal year 2024, Marvell reported declines in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of 7% and 29%, respectively. The company also reported GAAP net losses for the fourth quarter and year. Soft demand in the consumer, carrier infrastructure and enterprise networking markets was a driving factor. That's the bad news.\nThe good news is twofold. First, prior to fiscal year 2024, MRVL had been growing revenues, adjusted EPS and Ebitda. And second, in fiscal year 2024, MRVL grew its AI business substantially. The company's AI revenue in the fourth quarter eclipsed $200 million, which was about 10% of total company revenues\u2014up from 3% in the prior year.\nThe bullish view is that MRVL will turn around its income statement performance as AI becomes a larger piece of the business and the conditions in other end markets improve.\n7. Darktrace PLC (DRKTF)\nHere's a quick look at DRKTF by the numbers:\n\nStock price: $6.05\nTTM operating cash flow: $80 million\nTTM adjusted, diluted EPS: $0.17\nProjected upside: 21%\nDividend yield: NA\n\nDarktrace PLC Overview\nDarktrace, like Crowdstrike, provides AI-powered cybersecurity solutions. Darktrace and Crowdstrike Falcon are often viewed as competing platforms, but they also integrate with one another.\nWhy DRKTF Is A Top Choice\nDarktrace reported 27.4% revenue growth and 8,939% net profit growth in the first half of its fiscal year 2024 versus the year-ago period. Leadership cites a strategy change plus improved economic conditions as key contributors.\nThanks to double-digit growth in its annual recurring revenue, Darktrace also raised its revenue outlook for the full fiscal year by 50 basis points. The new expectation is a range of 23.5% to 25%. Going forward, the company will benefit from its 89% gross margin coupled with multiyear contracts and a flexible cost structure.\nMethodology Used To Pick These AI Stocks\nThese seven stocks directly benefit from increased AI adoption. TSM and MRVL provide hardware that enables AI, while the rest deliver AI benefits to their customers. All seven companies are loved by analysts, have double-digit upside in share price and show positive momentum in their AI-related operations, if not company-wide.\nBottom Line\nNvidia proved itself to be a wealth-building AI stock in the span of about 12 months. It's likely a few other AI players will experience their own wild price rallies, particularly as more businesses realize quantifiable benefits related to their AI implementations. The fun thing is that even a modest AI position coupled with a rally can deliver a nice bump to your net worth.\nRead Next\n\nHow To Make Your Stock Dividend Earnings Tax-Free\nIs A Mega Backdoor Roth Right For You?

Netflix reported mixed results to kick off the new earnings season. The video-streaming giant provided underwhelming sales guidance for the full year and guided for growth to decelerate in the second half of the year.\u00a0Also, Netflix surprisingly announced it will stop disclosing subscriber count (starting in the first quarter of 2025), and this is contributing to the market's concerns about the business. The company's post-earnings stock decline is likely dampening the sentiment toward tech stocks.  It was a challenging week for most risk assets following news of escalating tension between Israel and Iran, which is raising concerns among investors, given the potential disruptions to business supply chains, especially in the Middle East. These add to the ongoing inflation worries after the March 2024 CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) report revealed inflation came in slightly hotter than expected. On April 16, 2024, Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, adding, \"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.\" This suggests the Fed might not lower its policy rates as fast as anticipated in 2024, with markets pricing in fewer rate cuts for the year. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free. What is the market telling us: Nvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 9 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.   Story Continues The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 11 months ago, when the stock gained 23.7% on the news that the company delivered an exceptional quarter that topped analysts' estimates across key metrics. Revenue surpassed expectations by an impressive 10.3%, driven by strong data center revenue. Notably, the company improved profitability, with both gross margin and operating margin outperforming expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) beat by an impressive 18.8%. Inventory levels experienced a nice decrease during the quarter. In addition to the outstanding quarterly results, the revenue guidance for the next quarter surpassed expectations by over 50%. Yes, that's not a typo. Similarly, the operating profit guidance exceeded Consensus estimates meaningfully.Founder and CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the ongoing transformations in the computer industry, particularly the advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI. He highlighted Nvidia's readiness to seize the opportunities presented by the anticipated trillion-dollar shift in global data center infrastructure from general-purpose to accelerated computing, as firms implement generative AI into their business operations.Overall, the company's blowout quarter, with its impressive revenue growth, enhanced profitability, and positive guidance, underscored its strength in the market. Nothing in this world is perfect, but this was a near-perfect quarter.Nvidia is up 58.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $764.31 per share it is still trading 19.5% below its 52-week high of $950.02 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $16,239.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover emerging technologies with a focus on infrastructure and AIFollow AuthorApr 26, 2024, 01:41am EDTShareSaveCommentNvidia HQNVIDIA\nNvidia announced that it\u2019s acquiring Run:ai, an Israeli startup that built a Kubernetes-based GPU orchestrator. While the price is not disclosed, there are reports that it is valued anywhere between $700 million and $1 billion.\n\n\nThe acquisition of Run:ai highlights Kubernetes' growing importance in the generative AI era. This makes Kubernetes the de facto standard for managing GPU-based accelerated computing infrastructure.\n\nRun:ai is a Tel Aviv, Israel-based AI infrastructure startup founded in 2018 by Omri Geller (CEO) and Dr. Ronen Dar (CTO). It has created an orchestration and virtualization platform tailored to the specific requirements of AI workloads running on GPUs, which efficiently pools and shares resources. Tiger Global Management and Insight Partners led a $75 million Series C round in March 2022, bringing the company's total funding to $118 million.\n\n\nThe Problem Run:ai Solves \nUnlike CPUs, GPUs cannot be easily virtualized so that multiple workloads can use them at the same time. Hypervisors like VMware's vSphere and KVM enabled the emulation of multiple virtual CPUs from a single physical processor, giving workloads the illusion that they were running on a dedicated CPU. When it comes to GPUs, they cannot be effectively shared across multiple machine learning tasks, such as training and inference. For example, researchers cannot use half of a GPU for training and experimentation while using the other half for another machine learning task. Similarly, they cannot pool multiple GPUs to make better use of the available resources. This poses a huge challenge to enterprises running GPU-based workloads in the cloud or on-premises.\n\nThe problem described above extends to containers and Kubernetes. If a container requires a GPU, it will effectively consume 100% of the GPU if it is not used to its full potential. The shortage of AI chips and GPUs exacerbates the problem.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nRun:ai saw an opportunity to effectively solve this problem. They used Kubernetes' primitives and proven scheduling mechanisms to create a layer that allows enterprises to use only a fraction of the available GPU or pool multiple GPUs. This resulted in better utilization of GPUs, delivering better economics.\n\nHere are five key features of Run:ai platform:\n\n\nOrchestration and virtualization software layer tailored to AI workloads running on GPUs and other chipsets. This allows efficient pooling and sharing of GPU compute resources.\nIntegration with Kubernetes for container orchestration. Run:ai's platform is built on Kubernetes and supports all Kubernetes variants. It also integrates with third-party AI tools and frameworks.\nCentralized interface for managing shared compute infrastructure. Users can manage clusters, pool GPUs and allocate computing power for various tasks through Run:ai's interface.\nDynamic scheduling, GPU pooling and GPU fractioning for maximum efficiency. Run:ai's software enables splitting GPUs into fractions and allocating them dynamically to optimize utilization.\nIntegration with Nvidia's AI stack includes DGX systems, Base Command, NGC containers and AI Enterprise software. Run:ai has partnered closely with Nvidia to offer a full-stack solution.\n\n\n\n\nNotably, Run:ai is not an open-source solution, even though it is based on Kubernetes. It provides customers with proprietary software that must be deployed in their Kubernetes clusters together with a SaaS-based management application.\nWhy Did Nvidia Acquire Run:ai?\nNvidia\u2019s acquisition of Run:ai strategically positions the company to strengthen its leadership in the AI and machine learning sectors, especially in the context of optimizing GPU utilization for these technologies. Here are the primary reasons why Nvidia pursued this acquisition:\nEnhanced GPU Orchestration and Management: Run:ai\u2019s advanced orchestration tools are pivotal for managing GPU resources more efficiently. This capability is critical as the demand for AI and machine learning solutions continues to rise, requiring more sophisticated management of hardware resources to ensure optimal performance and utilization.\nIntegration with Nvidia's Existing AI Ecosystem: By acquiring Run:ai, Nvidia can integrate this technology into its existing suite of AI and machine learning products. This enhances Nvidia\u2019s overall product offerings, allowing for better service to customers who rely on Nvidia\u2019s ecosystem for their AI infrastructure needs. Nvidia, HGX, DGX and DGX Cloud customers will gain access to Run:ai\u2019s capabilities for their AI workloads, particularly for generative AI workloads.\nExpansion of Market Reach: Run:ai\u2019s established relationships with key players in the AI space, including their prior integration with Nvidia\u2019s technologies, provide Nvidia with an expanded market reach and the potential to serve a broader array of customers. This is particularly valuable in sectors that are rapidly adopting AI technologies but face challenges in resource management and scalability.\nInnovation and Research Development: The acquisition enables Nvidia to harness the innovative capabilities of Run:ai\u2019s team, known for their pioneering work in GPU virtualization and management. This could lead to further advancements in GPU technology and orchestration, keeping Nvidia at the forefront of technological developments in AI.\nCompetitive Advantage in a Growing Market: As enterprises increase their investment in AI and machine learning, effective GPU management becomes a competitive advantage. Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of Run:ai ensures it remains competitive against other tech giants venturing into the AI hardware and orchestration space.\nBy acquiring Run:ai, Nvidia not only enhances its product capabilities but also solidifies its position as a leader in the AI infrastructure market, ensuring it stays ahead of the curve in technology innovations and market demands.\nWhat Does This Mean For Kubernetes And Cloud Native Ecosystem?\nNvidia\u2019s acquisition of Run:ai is significant for the Kubernetes and cloud-native ecosystems for several reasons:\nEnhanced GPU Orchestration in Kubernetes: The integration of Run:ai's advanced GPU management and virtualization capabilities into Kubernetes will allow for more dynamic allocation and efficient utilization of GPU resources across AI workloads. This aligns with Kubernetes' capabilities in handling complex, resource-intensive applications, particularly in AI and machine learning, where efficient resource management is critical\u200b\u200b.\nAdvancements in Cloud-Native AI Infrastructure: By leveraging Run:ai's technology, Nvidia can further enhance the Kubernetes ecosystem's ability to support high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads. This synergy between Nvidia\u2019s GPU technology and Kubernetes will likely lead to more robust solutions for deploying, managing and scaling AI applications in cloud-native environments\u200b.\nWider Adoption and Innovation: The acquisition could drive broader adoption of Kubernetes in sectors that are increasingly reliant on AI, such as healthcare, automotive and finance. The ability to efficiently manage GPU resources in these sectors can lead to faster innovation and deployment cycles for AI models\u200b\u200b.\nImpact on Kubernetes Maturity: The integration of Nvidia and Run:ai technologies with Kubernetes underlines the platform's maturity and readiness to support advanced AI workloads, reinforcing Kubernetes as the de facto system for modern AI and ML deployments.

However, CIOs looking for computing power needed to train AIs for specific uses, or to run huge AI projects will likely see value in the Blackwell project.\n\n\n\n\nAnd if the Blackwell specs on paper hold up in reality, the new GPU gives Nvidia AI-focused performance that its competitors can\u2019t match, says Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst of enterprise architecture at Forrester Research.\n\u201cThey basically have a comprehensive solution from the chip all the way to data centers at this point,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnmatched power for AI\nFor CIOs with AI aspirations, the Blackwell announcement will signal the ability to experiment with super chips or dedicated servers, Nguyen adds. Blackwell will allow enterprises with major AI needs to deploy so-called superpods, another name for AI supercomputers. Blackwell will also allow enterprises with very deep pockets to set up AI factories, made up of integrated compute resources, storage, networking, workstations, software, and other pieces.\nThe case for Blackwell is clear, adds Shane Rau, research VP for semiconductors at IDC. As AI models get larger, they\u2019ll require more performance for training and inferencing, the process that a trained AI uses to draw conclusions from new data, he says.\nAs LLM AIs trained in 2023 are deployed, \u201cCIOs will learn what works and what doesn\u2019t, and so a retrain and redeployment cycle will begin,\u201d Rau says. \u201cThus, the need for Blackwell should be strong.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf organizations aren\u2019t training their own LLMs, the AI case for Blackwell is highly dependent on their industry verticals and internal workflows, Rau adds. \u201cThe more application-specific the workload they have and fewer resources they can bring to bear, the longer they\u2019ll have to wait for AI solution stack and AI model standardization,\u201d he says.\nNIM, Nvidia\u2019s software package to optimize inference for several AI models, should also gain traction in the market, because many companies won\u2019t be able to train AIs for their purposes, Rau says.\n\u201cNot everyone has the resources to train and deploy AI models at scale, nor do folks want to buy general models when all they need is a model specific to their identified workloads,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, pre-trained models and run-time models made off-the-shelf for IT folks to buy and maybe tune a little bit, will be necessary for AI to scale across enterprises and across the internet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond AI, the Blackwell GPU will have uses for CIOs with other heavy computational needs, says Javier Muniz, CTO at LCC Attorney, a legal website.\n\u201cGPUs like Blackwell could revolutionize the fields of data analytics, 3D modeling, cryptography, and even advanced web rendering \u2014 areas where processing speed and power are crucial,\u201d he says. \u201cIn terms of benefits for CIOs, many have vast data sets that need to be processed and analyzed. GPUs can drastically reduce the time taken for these computations.\u201d\nDoes AI scale?\nNvidia\u2019s Huang touted the benefits of GPU-powered accelerated computing, for AI and other purposes, during his keynote, saying that general-purpose computing has \u201crun out of steam.\u201d But Nvidia\u2019s many announcements during the conference didn\u2019t address a handful of ongoing challenges on the hardware side of AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GPU market is still recovering from supply shortages driven by several factors, including high demand from cryptocurrency miners and AI projects. Nvidia\u2019s lead in the high-end AI GPU market should concern companies focused on AI projects, adds Subutai Ahmad, CEO of Numenta, a provider of a CPU-based AI scaling platform that potentially competes with Nvidia GPUs.\n\u201cThe dominance of Nvidia combined with the shortages of GPUs and GPU parts mean that CIOs must look for alternatives,\u201d Ahmad says. \u201cThey can\u2019t be single sourced and then left high and dry on their AI initiatives.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Huang, in his keynote, talked about the need to scale computing power, to drive down the cost of computing while being sustainable. But AI still has a scaling problem, says Forrester\u2019s Nguyen. So far, the costs and power needs of AI don\u2019t incrementally diminish as enterprises add users or workloads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompanies can now throw more GPUs at an AI workload, but that\u2019s not viable over the long run, Nguyen says.\n\u201cThe problem is that once you get that first 100 users and you add another 100, is it getting cheaper, and the requirements getting smaller?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe answer is, not yet.\u201d \nWhile Nvidia and other hardware providers highlight their growing capabilities, only hyperscalers are now able to afford AI factories and the highest performing LLMs, Nguyen adds. \u201cYou can have effective basic performance, but you still have that long-term scalability issue,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRelated content\n\n \n\n\nFeature\n\nIT leaders: What\u2019s the gameplan as tech badly outpaces talent?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Maria Korolov \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t13 Mar 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n9 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHiring\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterview\n\nCulture and cloud combine to harness data at Regeneron\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy CIO staff \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12 Mar 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n7 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCloud Management\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGenerative AI\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nFinOps breaks out of the cloud\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Robert Mitchell \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12 Mar 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n11 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFintech\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tICT Partners\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\nNew US CIO appointments, March 2025\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Martha Heller \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t12 Mar 2025\t\t\t\t\t\n\n9 mins \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCareers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIT Leadership\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Sections\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPODCASTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIDEOS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESOURCES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpotlight: Managing modern risks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFrom our editors straight to your inbox\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tGet started by entering your email address below.\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        by                                                             \n                                                                Grant Gross                                                            \n\n\nSenior Writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Grant Gross on X\n \n\n\n\nGrant Gross, a senior writer at CIO, is a long-time technology journalist.

Stable Diffusion is used for conceptual design in architecture, and also accelerates the new AI Visualizer in BIM software Archicad.\nBoth GPUs also offer ray tracing capabilities for next generation CAD/BIM software and entry-level viz tools. According to Nvidia, the RTX A1000 with its 18 RT Cores can speed graphics and rendering tasks by up to 3x compared to the previous generation Nvidia T1000.\nWith a max power consumption of 50W, the Nvidia RTX A400 and A1000 will likely be predominantly sold in compact workstations like the HP Z2 Mini G9 and Dell Precision 3280 CFF. However, with an optional ATX Bracket they can also be fitted to more powerful multi-core desktop workstations. Both GPUs include four display outputs.\n\nWhat AEC Magazine thinks\nThis is a significant launch for Nvidia as it brings dedicated ray tracing and AI cores to its entry-level pro GPUs for the first time. Previously, these capabilities were reserved for Nvidia RTX professional GPUs that were 2000 class and above.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nWhile the new Nvidia RTX A400 and A1000 are equipped for hardware ray tracing, with 4 GB and 8 GB of memory respectively they will likely be best-suited to true entry-level viz workflows. The Nvidia RTX 2000 Ada Generation (16 GB) will likely remain the practical entry point for architects that use viz software like Enscape and Twinmotion, alongside BIM tools like Revit and Archicad.\nPerhaps the biggest reason for Nvidia to make these new cards RTX-enabled is to support AI workflows across its entire product range \u2013 so when Microsoft (Windows, Office) and others add more AI features into their software, workstation users have Nvidia Tensor cores on hand to do the heavy lifting, rather than having to rely on general purpose Nvidia Cuda cores or Intel / AMD CPUs.\nRelated articles:AMD announces Ryzen Threadripper Pro 5000 WX-SeriesNEWS: Bentley acquires Synchro for 4D construction modellingISO 19650: going globalHP Z2 Mini G9 workstation launches with Nvidia RTX A2000Autodesk ImpressionAllplan enhances viz workflow with LumionLenovo updates ThinkStation P620 with new Threadripper ProAMD gives glimpse of how \u2018Vega\u2019 might impact design viz and simulation\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPrevious Post \n\nNext Post \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nStay informed\nJoin the AEC community\nNewsletter \u2022 FREE digital magazine \u2022 print magazine\nGo\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLatest content \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAI and the future of arch viz\n\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWorkstation Special Report \u2013 Winter 2025\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMotif to take on Revit: exclusive interview\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAllplan acquires Manufacton to boost offsite\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nD5 Render 2.10 introduces real-time path tracing\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \u00a9 2008 - 2024 X3DMedia\r\n19 Leyden Street, London, E1 7LE, UK\r\nTel: +44(0)20 3355 7310                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Cookie Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll admit that having a favorite graphics card is probably weird, but the Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 holds a special place in my heart. It\u2019s the first GPU I ever bought brand new, following years of buying preowned components to stuff inside my cobbled-together gaming PC. Ten years on, and unlike the green team, I haven\u2019t forced my EVGA card into retirement yet, so I thought I\u2019d run through how it holds up handling new releases in 2024.Given the above, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising to hear that I consider the GeForce GTX 970 to be the best graphics card out of the entire 900-series line-up. Yes, I know, the GTX 980 Ti was the flagship of the Maxell era, but honestly? Young Phil was more than happy to pay under $300 / \u00a3300 for a GPU that could still run Dark Souls 3 at 1080p without compromise two years after launch. In fact, I recall it blasting through most of my Steam library after picking one up from Scan UK back in 2014, putting my old toasty GTX 470 to shame with its efficiency and temperatures.\u00a0Now, I want to throw in a few disclaimers before diving into the whole GTX 970 2024 experience. First off, unless you\u2019re going for a scrapheap challenge build, I wouldn\u2019t recommend picking up the card to play new releases. That\u2019s not to say the GPU doesn\u2019t hold its own, and we\u2019ll get onto why I think it still slaps, but you\u2019ll ultimately end up with a rig that isn\u2019t designed to handle today\u2019s grueling graphics. Secondly, my benchmarks here are more for a bit of fun rather than anything scientific, and I\u2019m sure that if I didn\u2019t just chuck it into an Intel Core i9-13900K build, I\u2019d have ended up with different results.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI've been using the RTX 5070 to play a bunch of games early, and it might be the console killing GPU I've been waiting for\n\n\n\n\nTired of seeing RTX 5070 Ti out of stock signs? I'd consider this 4K GPU instead\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)Rather than try and get the GTX 970 to pull off the same tricks as something like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super, I decided to cut the aging graphics card some slack. By that, I mean I used the same approach as when testing the best gaming handhelds and set all game settings to low. Not doing so would more or less result in PowerPoint presentation levels of speed, and dialing things back means we\u2019ll actually get meaningful figures.\u00a0What I have kept the same is my selection of test games, as that\u2019ll help us compare the experience to modern-day alternatives. While the GTX 970 won\u2019t be able to remotely keep up with anything from the past five years, I enjoy the idea of potentially getting it to provide the same fps by compromising settings. Anyway, here\u2019s a bunch of figures to glance at before we dive into the qualitative side of things.Swipe to scroll horizontallyNvidia GeForce GTX 970 benchmarksGames testedAverage fps (1080p, low settings)Cyberpunk 207740fpsHitman 385fpsTotal War: Warhammer 395fpsHalo Infinite72fpsBaldur's Gate 358fpsOkay, let\u2019s get the stinky Cyberpunk 2077 result out the way first, as I\u2019m not even a little bit surprised that it\u2019s low. I wouldn\u2019t call 40fps unplayable, but for the amount of visual compromise involved, it\u2019s not an ideal setup. I guess I\u2019m still surprised that the game can handle Night City\u2019s shenanigans, and I reckon it fares better than the PS4 when the RPG first launched. (I\u2019m only half joking.)Place the fact we\u2019re talking about lowest settings aside, and I\u2019m pretty gobsmacked by the rest of the benchmarks. I mean it when I say I could happily play Hitman 3 and Total War: Warhammer 3 on a GTX 970 today, especially if my eyes had never witnessed better textures and visuals. Don\u2019t get me wrong, everything does end up looking a bit low res to achieve frame rates well over 60fps, but nothing looked overly egregious when it comes to these two games specifically.Sign up to the GamesRadar+ NewsletterWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and moreContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.I had a bit of a funny run-in with Halo Infinite, as when I first booted it up using the GTX 970, I was presented with what could be OG Xbox graphics. Turns out that the weirdly charming lack of textures was a symptom of in-game scaling, as I\u2019d accidentally set my desktop resolution to 4K. Sticking with native 1080p instantly remedied the issues, providing over 70fps in most multiplayer matches.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)If there\u2019s one certainty in my life these days, it\u2019s that I\u2019ll never escape the urge to dive into Baldur\u2019s Game 3 at least once a month. So, it felt only right to include the massive D&D outing in my GTX 970 benchmarks, and this isn\u2019t even the first time I\u2019ve done so. Back when the game first launched, I fetched my trusty old GPU to check whether Larian's minimum requirements were sensible, as the developer included the card within its recommended specs.\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)In case you didn't read that previous Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 specs run down, the GTX 970 can handle the RPG with settings cranked down low. You won\u2019t quite reach that golden 60fps average during gameplay, and I did experience some stuttering during flashy battles. But hey, it works, and if you\u2019re not too fussed about the detailing on that gnarly set of armor you\u2019ve slapped on Karlach, you should be able to save Faerun without a hardware hitch. That said, the beaten path will also look like something from a PS2 outing, so perhaps curb your visual expectations.One thing I\u2019d like to commend this EVGA version of the GTX 970 is temps, as the card managed to stay at 70\u00b0C or below. Perhaps if I pushed the GPU a little, we\u2019d end up with warmer results that\u2019d spark concern, but the vendor\u2019s dual fan cooling solution isn\u2019t too different from what you\u2019d find on modern models.Should you buy a GTX 970 in 2024?\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Phil Hayton)Before buying any graphics card, I\u2019d strongly recommend considering both your budget and visual requirements. That way, you\u2019ll be able to easily figure out whether you should get super thrifty and buy a GTX 970 in 2024, or opt for something brand new. Ultimately, there\u2019s a huge gulf between these two choices specifically, as entry-level GPUs like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 are an entirely different beast.For starters, GTX graphics cards can\u2019t use Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered DLSS toolkit, which provides access to handy Super Resolution and Frame Generation abilities. New 70-series cards like the GeForce RTX 4070 Super can effectively boost fps with minimal caveats using clever upscaling tricks, enabling you to use higher resolutions than what should be possible natively. Not every game is compatible, but the feature is a budget PC godsend, and it should mean you\u2019ll be able to hold onto the Lovelace card for longer. Put it this way, I\u2019ll be disappointed if someone isn\u2019t able to write an article just like this about the 4070 in 10 years, assuming that we aren\u2019t just beaming 4K visuals into our brains by that point.Despite all of that, I\u2019d still say the GTX 970 is worth thinking about in 2024. Chances are that some of you are looking to get into PC gaming for as cheap as possible, and Nvidia\u2019s 2014 GPU goes for under $50 on the likes of eBay. You might end up with a machine that isn\u2019t designed to win against ferocious modern Steam libraries, but if you can thrift a build that\u2019s suited, you\u2019ll end up with a rig that\u2019ll happily handle your backlog and some new release experimentation.\u00a0Anyway, here\u2019s to another 10 years of the GTX 970 smugly sitting on my GPU shelf. If I\u2019m sat here in a decade, I\u2019ll let it finally die trying to run The Elder Scrolls 6.\u00a0Today's best graphics card dealsGeForce RTX 4070 Super \u00a3666.95ViewSee all pricesAMD Radeon RX 7600 \u00a3223.99ViewSee all pricesDeal ends Tue, 25 Mar, 2025Intel Arc A770 \u00a3280.22ViewSee all pricesNvidia RTX 4060 \u00a3391.86 \u00a3290.99ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesLooking for a rig with the latest components?

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I kickstarted my relationship with technology by jamming a Hot Wheels double-decker bus into my parent\u2019s VCR, but we all have to start somewhere. I even somehow managed to become a walking, talking buyer\u2019s guide at my teenage supermarket job, which helped me accept my career fate. So, rather than try to realise my musician dreams, or see out my University degree, I started running my own retro pop culture site and writing about video games and tech for the likes of TechRadar, The Daily Star, and the BBC before eventually ending up with a job covering graphics card shenanigans at PCGamesN.

The software technology resides on an advanced AI infrastructure that is designed, built, and deployed by\u00a0Penguin Solutions, providing a virtual gateway to a high-performance computing environment.\u00a0The first phase of the endeavor is powered by 20 NVIDIA HGX H100 systems, housing 160 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, one of the most powerful computational accelerators capable of enabling and supporting advanced AI and machine learning efforts. The system is interconnected with an NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform, featuring in-network computing.\u00a0Infrastructure support is led by Georgia Tech\u2019s Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would take a single NVIDIA H100 GPU one second to come up with a multiplication operation that would take Georgia Tech\u2019s 50,000 students 22 years to achieve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        20 NVIDIA H100-HGX servers, each with:\n                      \n8 x NVIDIA H100 GPUs (SXM5 form-factor)2 x 32-Core Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs (2.8 GHz)2TB 4800 MHz DDR5 DRAM3 x 3.84 TB NVMe storage1 x ConnectX-7 IB NIC (200 Gbps)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        18 NVIDIA H200-HGX servers, each with:\n                      \n8 x NVIDIA H200 GPUs (SXM5 form-factor)2 x 32-Core Intel Emerald Rapids CPUs (2.8 GHz)2TB 5600 MHz DDR5 DRAM8 x 3.84 TB NVMe storage1 x ConnectX-7 IB NIC (200 Gbps)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Total System:\n                      \n304 NVIDIA H100/H200 GPUs2,432 Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU cores76 TB 4800 MHz DDR5 DRAM783.4 TB NVMe storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Blank Space (small)(text and background only visible when logged in)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Blank Space (small)(text and background only visible when logged in)\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are GPUs and CPUs?GPUs (graphics processing units) are specialized processors designed to handle certain complex computations efficiently, commonly used in tasks such as rendering high-resolution graphics and performing parallel computations in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence. CPUs (central processing units) are the central component of a computer responsible for executing instructions, managing tasks, and coordinating the operation of various hardware components, serving as the brain of the computer.GPUs have become prominent due to their exceptional parallel processing capabilities, which make them highly efficient for high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. Additionally, advancements in GPU technology have led to significant improvements in graphics rendering, gaming experiences, and visual computing applications, further driving their prominence in various industries and fields.How many GPUs are in the Georgia Tech AI Makerspace and what makes them important?Phase I of the Georgia Tech AI Makerspace comprises a total of 160 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. 20 NVIDIA H100-HGX servers contain 8 GPUs each.The benefit of GPUs is that they provide extremely performant accelerators designed specifically for AI, with a very large unified memory space that can accommodate very big models.It\u2019s also noteworthy that an important capability of AI is low-precision performance. These nodes provide roughly 640 petaflops (PF) of theoretical 8-bit floating-point for 8-bit integer (FP8/INT8) capability, combined with the 640 gigabytes of GPU memory per server.Why are there both GPUs and CPUs in the Georgia Tech AI Makerspace?\u00a0CPUs and GPUs are optimized for different kinds of calculations, so it\u2019s useful to have both available. Optimized software will perform certain steps of code on the CPU and others on the GPU to maximize performance.CPUs are \u201cstandard\u201d general-purpose chips that work well for many calculations. GPUs are specialized.\u00a0A server cannot run without a CPU. The CPU handles all the tasks required for all software on the server to run correctly.\u00a0GPUs are accelerators with more focused computational hardware that rely on a separate host system to operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho will manage the infrastructure of the AI Makerspace?\u00a0The AI Makerspace infrastructure will be supported by Georgia Tech\u2019s Partnership\u00a0for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE). PACE provides sustainable leading-edge Research Computing and Data (RCD) cyberinfrastructure, software, and support for research and education requiring high performance computing and other advanced research computing infrastructure.\u00a0PACE is a collaboration between Georgia Tech faculty and the Office of Information Technology (OIT) focused on HPC.Is the AI Makerspace scalable?Yes. Each GPU can be physically partitioned into 7 GPUs (with 1/8 the capability of the whole). With 160 total GPUs, the AI Makerspace can provide 1,120 concurrent GPUs to allow large numbers of students access simultaneously.\u00a0How much power does the AI Makerspace require?The new servers will draw about 140kW of power, compared to the 800kW PACE\u2019s five existing clusters draw.The theoretical 64-bit performance of the new hardware is 5.5 PF (petaflops, a measurement of computer speed of performing calculations).

Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool   April 5, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          SMCI            In the world of artificial intelligence (AI) investing, few stocks have been better recently than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). These two have had a phenomenal 2024 so far, with Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro) up over 250% and Nvidia up by 80%. But that performance becomes even more impressive if you backdate to the start of 2023, as Supermciro and Nvidia are up an astounding 1,160% and 520%, respectively. That level of performance might have investors wondering if there's room for more. If there is, the next obvious question is, \"Which one should I buy?\" So, between the two, which is the better AI stock to buy today? Let's find out. Nvidia and Supermicro work together These two companies aren't competitors; they are complementary. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) -- computing hardware that specializes in effectively processing intense calculations. These devices have been used for gaming graphics, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, AI model training, and practically every other use that would require significant computing power to process.  Fortunately for Nvidia, most users (besides gamers) don't just have a single GPU. They buy hundreds or thousands of them and connect them to form supercomputers often housed in servers at a data center. However, haphazardly linking them together will not result in an optimized computing experience, which is where Supermicro comes in. Supermicro specializes in server design and has separated itself from competitors by offering highly customizable products that can be designed for workload type and size. Furthermore, Supermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure its servers have been designed in an optimized manner so the end-user gets the most use out of their product. This brings up the first difference: Supermicro has less differentiating technology. While Nvidia's GPUs are market-leading, Supermicro relies on industry knowledge and customization to separate itself from competitors. This can be a sustainable advantage, but it's less sustainable than having superior technology.  Another difference is that Supermicro is essentially an Nvidia reseller. It takes Nvidia's GPUs and other components to make its servers and then sells them to its clients. Because it cannot control the GPU pricing (the most significant cost of the server), Supermicro's margins are much slimmer than Nvidia's.   SMCI Gross Profit Margin data by YCharts  Once again, this is just a differentiating factor. Plenty of businesses have succeeded with much lower margins.   Story Continues But when it all adds up, my lean starts to go in Nvidia's direction due to its technological prowess and higher margins. Additionally, when I look at each stock's valuation, Nvidia also looks to have an advantage there.Supermicro's stock has gotten very expensiveAfter these two stocks' incredible runs, valuing them can be difficult. Trailing metrics aren't useful, as they are still undergoing massive changes (both Supermicro and Nvidia grew revenue by over 100% in their latest results). As a result, I'll use a forward-facing metric like the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value the companies.Forward metrics have their issues, as they utilize analyst projections to value a company, which isn't an exact science. Still, it's arguably the best way to value these businesses, but Supermicro certainly comes with a price premium over Nvidia on this basis.  SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts This makes sense, as Supermicro's boom is just beginning, while Nvidia's is starting to mature (even though Wall Street analysts project nearly 100% revenue growth this year).With Nvidia's stock trading at a lower level (and thus lower expectations to meet) than Supermicro's, I think there's no doubt that Nvidia is the superior AI stock. That's not to say that Supermicro is a bad stock, as it will likely continue to succeed due to its strong product offering and customization. However, the valuation bar is a bit higher for Supermicro, so I'm giving the nod to Nvidia.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In addition to AI-focused R&D efforts, the facility also supported the construction of Taiwan\u2019s largest supercomputer, Taipei-1.Taipei-1 consists of 64 DGX H100 AI systems and 64 OVX systems, with each DGX featuring eight H100 GPUs and two Intel Xeon Platinum 8480C CPUs. The machine is targeted at heavy AI workloads and will be made available on the Nvidia DGX Cloud, allowing enterprises and researchers to try Nvidia products before they buy.In comments reported by China Times, Qiu Qiuhui, the director of technology at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that in addition to a second R&D center, Nvidia\u2019s ongoing investment plan for Taiwan includes sharing supercomputer resources with industry partners in the region and training AI talent at both the National Taiwan University and Tsinghua University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSC24: What\u2019s everyone talking about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nFrosty with a chance of GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in Southeast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Jan 2025\n\n\n\n\nSK Telecom launches GPUaaS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nSoftBank Group and OpenAI team up for enterprise AI offering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 Nov 2024\n\n\n\n\nIQM to deploy quantum computer in Taiwan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nR&D\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nTaipei-1\n\n\nTaiwan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The same goes for apps powered by AI.\nA foundation model is an AI neural network trained on immense amounts of raw data, generally with unsupervised learning.\nIt\u2019s a type of artificial intelligence model trained to understand and generate human-like language. Imagine giving a computer a huge library of books to read and learn from, so it can understand the context and meaning behind words and sentences, just like a human does.\nFoundation models.\nA foundation model\u2019s deep knowledge base and ability to communicate in natural language make it useful for a broad range of applications, including text generation and summarization, copilot production and computer code analysis, image and video creation, and audio transcription and speech synthesis.\nChatGPT, one of the most notable generative AI applications, is a chatbot built with OpenAI\u2019s GPT foundation model. Now in its fourth version, GPT-4 is a large multimodal model that can ingest text or images and generate text or image responses.\nOnline apps built on foundation models typically access the models from a data center. But many of these models, and the applications they power, can now run locally on PCs and workstations with NVIDIA GeForce and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nFoundation Model Uses\nFoundation models can perform a variety of functions, including:\n\nLanguage processing: understanding and generating text\nCode generation: analyzing and debugging computer code in many programming languages\nVisual processing: analyzing and generating images\nSpeech: generating text to speech and transcribing speech to text\n\nThey can be used as is or with further refinement. Rather than training an entirely new AI model for each generative AI application \u2014\u00a0a costly and time-consuming endeavor \u2014 users commonly fine-tune foundation models for specialized use cases.\nPretrained foundation models are remarkably capable, thanks to prompts and data-retrieval techniques like retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. Foundation models also excel at transfer learning, which means they can be trained to perform a second task related to their original purpose.\nFor example, a general-purpose large language model (LLM) designed to converse with humans can be further trained to act as a customer service chatbot capable of answering inquiries using a corporate knowledge base.\nEnterprises across industries are fine-tuning foundation models to get the best performance from their AI applications.\nTypes of Foundation Models\nMore than 100 foundation models are in use \u2014 a number that continues to grow. LLMs and image generators are the two most popular types of foundation models. And many of them are free for anyone to try \u2014 on any hardware \u2014 in the NVIDIA API Catalog.\nLLMs are models that understand natural language and can respond to queries. Google\u2019s Gemma is one example; it excels at text comprehension, transformation and code generation. When asked about the astronomer Cornelius Gemma, it shared that his \u201ccontributions to celestial navigation and astronomy significantly impacted scientific progress.\u201d It also provided information on his key achievements, legacy and other facts.\nExtending the collaboration of the Gemma models, accelerated with the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on RTX GPUs, Google\u2019s CodeGemma brings powerful yet lightweight coding capabilities to the community. CodeGemma models are available as 7B and 2B pretrained variants that specialize in code completion and code generation tasks.\nMistralAI\u2019s Mistral LLM can follow instructions, complete requests and generate creative text. In fact, it helped brainstorm the headline for this blog, including the requirement that it use a variation of the series\u2019 name \u201cAI Decoded,\u201d and it assisted in writing the definition of a foundation model.\nHello, world, indeed.\nMeta\u2019s Llama 2 is a cutting-edge LLM that generates text and code in response to prompts.\nMistral and Llama 2 are available in the NVIDIA ChatRTX tech demo, running on RTX PCs and workstations. ChatRTX lets users personalize these foundation models by connecting them to personal content \u2014 such as documents, doctors\u2019 notes and other data \u2014 through RAG. It\u2019s accelerated by TensorRT-LLM for quick, contextually relevant answers. And because it runs locally, results are fast and secure.\nImage generators like StabilityAI\u2019s Stable Diffusion XL and SDXL Turbo let users generate images and stunning, realistic visuals. StabilityAI\u2019s video generator, Stable Video Diffusion, uses a generative diffusion model to synthesize video sequences with a single image as a conditioning frame.\nMultimodal foundation models can simultaneously process more than one type of data \u2014 such as text and images \u2014\u00a0to generate more sophisticated outputs.\nA multimodal model that works with both text and images could let users upload an image and ask questions about it. These types of models are quickly working their way into real-world applications like customer service, where they can serve as faster, more user-friendly versions of traditional manuals.\nMany foundation models are free to try \u2014 on any hardware \u2014 in the NVIDIA API Catalog.\nKosmos 2 is Microsoft\u2019s groundbreaking multimodal model designed to understand and reason about visual elements in images.\nThink Globally, Run AI Models Locally\u00a0\nGeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs can run foundation models locally.\nThe results are fast and secure. Rather than relying on cloud-based services, users can harness apps like ChatRTX to process sensitive data on their local PC without sharing the data with a third party or needing an internet connection.\nUsers can choose from a rapidly growing catalog of open foundation models to download and run on their own hardware. This lowers costs compared with using cloud-based apps and APIs, and it eliminates latency and network connectivity issues.\u00a0Generative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

Moore09 Apr 20243 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.Intel's Gaudi 3 is packaged with eight high-bandwidth memory chips.\n        Intel\n    \n\tAlthough the race to power the massive ambitions of AI companies might seem like it\u2019s all about Nvidia, there is a real competition going in AI accelerator chips. The latest example: At \n\tIntel\u2019s Vision 2024 event this week in Phoenix, Ariz., the company gave the first architectural details of its third-generation AI accelerator, Gaudi 3.\n\tWith the predecessor chip, the company had touted how close to parity its performance was to Nvidia\u2019s top chip of the time, H100, and claimed a superior ratio of price versus performance. With Gaudi 3, it\u2019s pointing to large-language-model (LLM) performance where it can claim outright superiority. But, looming in the background is Nvidia\u2019s next GPU, the \n\tBlackwell B200, expected to arrive later this year.\nGaudi Architecture Evolution\n\tGaudi 3 doubles down on its predecessor Gaudi 2\u2019s architecture, literally in some cases. Instead of Gaudi 2\u2019s single chip, Gaudi 3 is made up of two identical silicon dies joined by a high-bandwidth connection. Each has a central region of 48 megabytes of cache memory. Surrounding that are the chip\u2019s AI workforce\u2014four engines for matrix multiplication and 32 programmable units called tensor processor cores. All that is surrounded by connections to memory and capped with media processing and network infrastructure at one end.\n\n\tIntel says that all that combines to produce double the AI compute of Gaudi 2 using 8-bit floating-point infrastructure that has emerged as \n\tkey to training transformer models. It also provides a fourfold boost for computations using the BFloat 16 number format.\nGaudi 3 LLM Performance\n\tIntel projects a 40 percent faster training time for the GPT-3 175B large language model versus the H100 and even better results for the 7-billion and 8-billion parameter versions of Llama2.\n\n\tFor inferencing, the contest was much closer, according to Intel, where the new chip delivered 95 to 170 percent of the performance of H100 for two versions of Llama. Though for the \n\tFalcon 180B model, Gaudi 3 achieved as much as a fourfold advantage. Unsurprisingly, the advantage was smaller against the Nvidia H200\u201480 to 110 percent for Llama and 3.8x for Falcon.\n\n\tIntel claims more dramatic results when measuring power efficiency, where it projects as much as 220 percent H100\u2019s value on Llama and 230 percent on Falcon.\n\n\t\u201cOur customers are telling us that what they find limiting is getting enough power to the data center,\u201d says Intel\u2019s Habana Labs chief operating officer Eitan Medina.\n\n\tThe energy-efficiency results were best when the LLMs were tasked with delivering a longer output. Medina puts that advantage down to the Gaudi architecture\u2019s large-matrix math engines. These are 512 bits across. Other architectures use many smaller engines to perform the same calculation, but Gaudi\u2019s supersize version \u201cneeds almost an order of magnitude less memory bandwidth to feed it,\u201d he says.\nGaudi 3 Versus Blackwell\n\tIt\u2019s speculation to compare accelerators before they\u2019re in hand, but there are a couple of data points to compare, particular in memory and memory bandwidth. Memory has always been important in AI, and as generative AI has taken hold and popular models reach the tens of billions of parameters in size it\u2019s become even more critical.\n\n\tBoth make use of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is a stack of DRAM memory dies atop a control chip. In high-end accelerators, it sits inside the same package as the logic silicon, surrounding it on at least two sides. Chipmakers use advanced packaging, such as Intel\u2019s EMIB silicon bridges or TSMC\u2019s chip-on-wafer-on-silicon (CoWoS), to provide a high-bandwidth path between the logic and memory.\n\n\tAs the chart shows, Gaudi 3 has more HBM than H100, but less than H200, B200, or AMD\u2019s MI300. It\u2019s memory bandwidth is also superior to H100\u2019s. Possibly of importance to Gaudi\u2019s price competitiveness, it uses the less expensive HBM2e versus the others\u2019 HBM3 or HBM3e, which are thought to be a \n\tsignificant fraction of the tens of thousands of dollars the accelerators reportedly sell for.\n\t\n\tOne more point of comparison is that Gaudi 3 is made using \n\tTSMC\u2019s N5 (sometimes called 5-nanometer) process technology. Intel has basically been a process node behind Nvidia for generations of Gaudi, so it\u2019s been stuck comparing its latest chip to one that was at least one rung higher on the Moore\u2019s Law ladder. With Gaudi 3, that part of the race is narrowing slightly. The new chip uses the same process as H100 and H200. What\u2019s more, instead of moving to 3-nm technology, the coming competitor Blackwell is done on a process called N4P. TSMC describes N4P as being in the same 5-nm family as N5 but delivering an 11 percent performance boost, 22 percent better efficiency, and 6 percent higher density.\n\n\tIn terms of Moore\u2019s Law, the big question is what technology the next generation of Gaudi, currently code-named Falcon Shores, will use. So far the product has relied on TSMC technology while Intel gets its foundry business up and running. But next year Intel will begin offering its \n\t18A technology to foundry customers and will already be using 20A internally. These two nodes bring the next generation of transistor technology, nanosheets, with backside power delivery, a combination TSMC is not planning until 2026.\nFrom Your Site ArticlesHow We\u2019ll Reach a 1 Trillion Transistor GPU \u203aGoogle, Intel, Nvidia Battle in Generative AI Training \u203ahopperblackwellartificial intelligencellmsnvidiaamdai chipsgaudiintelSamuel K.

Designed in America, but made in Taiwan, Huang said Blackwell is the fastest chip ever and suited for AI.\"We're hoping that it does things that surprise us,\" Huang said. \"That's the whole point.\"Nvidia's surprising start in a Denny's\u00a0The futuristic Nvidia campus sits just down the road from the company's modest birthplace: a Denny's in San Jose, California. As a teenager, Huang, now 61, worked as a dishwasher in a Denny's. Three decades ago, it was in a San Jose Denny's, where he and two friends, co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, dreamed up a whole new way of processing video game graphics \u2014 and decided to start a company.\n\n\nBill Whitaker and Jensen Huang in a Denny's\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nAt the time, Huang was a 30-year-old electrical engineer, married with two young children. He and his two Nvidia co-founders had no idea how to start a company, but they went for it anyway. \u00a0\n\n\nTheir big idea was to accelerate the processing power of computers with a new graphics chip. Their initial attempt flopped and nearly bankrupted the company in 1996, but they were able to pivot and eventually create their groundbreaking GPU.Just eight years after Nvidia was hatched in Denny's, the company earned a spot in the S&P 500. Huang then set his sights on developing the software and hardware for a revolutionary, GPU-driven supercomputer, which would take the company far beyond video games. It seemed like a risky bet to Wall Street, but to early developers of AI, it was a revelation.\u00a0\"That was luck founded by vision,\" Huang said.\u00a0The technological capability they invented was perfect for AI researchers, he said. In 2016, Huang delivered Nvidia's AI supercomputer, the first of its kind, to Elon Musk, then a board member of OpenAI, which used it to create the building blocks of ChatGPT. When AI took off, so did Huang's reputation.\u00a0\n\n\nHe's now a Silicon Valley celebrity. As someone who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan at age 9, Huang said he could never have conceived of his success.\u00a0\"It is the most extraordinary thing, Bill, that a normal dishwasher-busboy could grow up to be this,\" Huang told 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker. \"There's no magic \u2014 it's just 61 years of hard work every single day.\"\n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\nPeople who work with Huang describe him as demanding, a perfectionist, and someone who's not easy to work for. Huang said all those descriptions sound right to him.\"It should be like that,\" he said. \"If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn't be easy.\"AI advancements made with Nvidia technologyAt Nvidia's annual developers conference in March, the mood wasn't just upbeat, it was downright giddy. More than 11,000 enthusiasts \u2014 software developers, tech moguls, and happy shareholders \u2014 filed into San Jose's pro hockey arena to kick off a four-day AI extravaganza.\u00a0Huang showed off some of what AI has made possible in just the past few years, like an AI-powered simulation of Earth's weather patterns, which will eventually be able to calculate and predict weather 3,000 times faster than a supercomputer while using 1,000 less energy, Huang said.Pinar Seyhan Demirdag, Cuebric co-founder, relies on Nvidia GPUs to instantly turn simple text prompts into virtual movie sets for a fraction of the cost of some of today's backdrops. She said her company is getting a lot of love from Hollywood.\u00a0\n\n\nAt Generate:Biomedicines, Dr. Alex Snyder \u2013 head of research and development \u2013 is using Nvidia's technology to create protein-based drugs. She was initially skeptical about the use of AI for drug development. Then she looked at the lab data, and changed her mind.\u00a0Now her team asks its AI models to create proteins to fight diseases like cancer and asthma. The AI generates proteins that don't exist in nature, which are then rigorously tested in the lab. A drug to defeat the coronavirus is in clinical trials.\u00a0\"We're not putting Frankensteins into people,\" Snyder said. \"We're taking what's known and we're really pushing the field, we're pushing the biology.\"Figure, a Silicon Valley startup with funding from Nvidia, has developed an Nvidia GPU-driven humanoid robot.\u00a0 CEO Brett Adcock says the robot is designed to address labor shortages, and would not be possible without Nvidia's technology.\u00a0\n\n\nFigure has developed an Nvidia GPU-driven humanoid robot.\u00a0\n\n            \n                60 Minutes\n\n                          \n\n\n\"We think they're arguably the best in the world at this,\" Adcock said.\u00a0His prototype is not yet perfected, but the early results are so promising that German automaker BMW plans to start testing the robot in its South Carolina factory this year. Adcock envisions a future with billions of robots working alongside humans.\u00a0Addressing worries about AIInvestors are bullish on Nvidia, but others fear AI technology is flying too high. Last year, more than 600 top AI scientists, ethicists and others signed a statement urging caution, warning of AI's risk to humanity. Some worry about AI taking jobs as the technology advances.\n\n\n\"I think over time, AI and robotics will start doing more and more of what humans can and better,\" Adcock said.\u00a0As Huang sees it, when companies become more productive, earnings will increase, which means they can hire more workers.\u00a0\"You still want human[s] in the loop, because we have good judgment,\" Huang said. \"Because there are circumstances that the machines are not, just not going to understand.\"Huang sees an AI future of progress and prosperity \u2014 not one with machines as our masters. To him, AI is a game-changing technology.\"We need artificial intelligence to help us explore the universe in places that we could've never done ourselves,\" Huang said.\n\n\n\nMore from CBS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hundreds of actors urging government not to loosen copyright laws for AI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The challenge of stopping drone swarms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Werner Herzog on the role of \"good criminal energy\" in making movies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lena Herzog on her husband Werner Herzog's acting career\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Drone swarms inside the U.S. could be spying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn:\n          Nvidia\n\n\nBill Whitaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Whitaker is an award-winning journalist and 60 Minutes correspondent who has covered major news stories, domestically and across the globe, for more than four decades with CBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Twitter\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

One noteworthy example came from Dell and its partnership with Nvidia to build an \"AI factory,\" a technology stack that includes storage and GPU-based servers for AI model training and data services.\nStorage and on-premises infrastructure vendors are showing customers they are prepared to support AI initiatives through partnerships and certifications with Nvidia, according to Brent Ellis, an analyst at Forrester Research.\n\"There is a perception that AI requires new storage capabilities, better performant storage, more storage,\" he said, adding that this is more marketing and corporate bragging rights than reality right now.\nPartnering with Nvidia means storage vendors must meet throughput capabilities and address bandwidth and latency needs for AI, Ellis said.\nScott Sinclair, an analyst at TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group, said just about every vendor is working with Nvidia, including the major cloud providers. But these relationships have become especially critical for infrastructure companies that want to support keeping customer data in the enterprise.\n\"The partnership is important for everybody, but more important for on-premises providers,\" he said.\nOn-premises providers are seeing a bit of a renaissance when it comes to AI workloads, Sinclair said. In its report \"Navigating the Cloud and AI Revolution: The State of Enterprise Storage and HCI,\" Enterprise Strategy Group found that companies are better understanding their storage options, including those for on premises. In that report, 78% of the 375 IT professionals in North America and Canada surveyed indicated that their organizations prefer to keep their proprietary, high-value data in their own data centers.\n\nLegacy supporting cutting edge\nAt GTC, several storage vendors highlighted new offerings aimed at AI. Vast Data is helping to create new AI architecture that uses data processing units to offload the burden from and increase the performance of Nvidia GPUs. Weka unveiled its first appliance, obtaining the vendor's SuperPod certification for Nvidia DGX systems and claiming a performance at 765 GBps.\nOthers addressed broader enterprise AI use cases. Lenovo, for example, extended its Nvidia partnership designed to power generative AI applications for enterprise and cloud uses. This includes new Lenovo ThinkSystem servers with support for the Nvidia HGX AI supercomputing platform. The servers also support the Nvidia H100 and H200 Tensor Core GPUs and the new Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell.\nIn a new partnership, Hitachi will create its iQ portfolio that combines Nvidia technologies with Hitachi Vantara's AI storage platform. Hitachi iQ's first offering will combine the vendor's file storage software and hardware with Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs and Nvidia AI software. The offering will seek Nvidia DGX BasePod reference architecture certification. And Pure Storage released an Nvidia OVX-validated reference architecture enabling cost- and performance-optimized storage designs for AI use cases.\nEach of the offerings attempts to address a use case such as speed in AI training or setting up storage optimally to work with Nvidia processing, Sinclair said. Dell, on the other hand, is trying to cover as many bases as possible by partnering with Nvidia to build an AI factory, which combines infrastructure and resources to streamline AI initiatives.\n\"What people don't expect with Dell is the level, breadth and quality of services that they're delivering around AI initiatives,\" he said.\n\n\nFrom storage to factory\nIn this case, the Dell AI Factory combines Dell's upcoming PowerEdge XE9680 server and PowerScale all-flash F710 storage with its data lakehouse and retrieval-augmented generation and model training. The Dell components and services, many of which are available now, are combined with Nvidia's GPU and AI software. Dell is offering its AI Factory as part of its Apex as-a-service portfolio and on premises.\nIt also includes access to Dell's Professional Services for GenAI, which is aimed at helping customers reach business results faster. Generally, services focus on deployment, troubleshooting and repair, Sinclair said. But Dell is expanding its services to include setting up customer AI initiatives.\n\"If you buy this service, by the end, you will have all of your data properly prepped and ready to go for a training environment for that use case,\" he said.\n\n\nNvidia, the only game in town?\nWhile storage vendors unveiled partnership after partnership, the AI tech landscape is evolving. Nvidia might be a market leader in GPU sales and related technologies right now, but it isn't the only vendor.\n\"When there is only one primary vendor, what you have is a technology, not a market,\" said Marc Staimer, president of Dragon Slaying Consulting.\nAI, including generative AI, needs high performance. While Nvidia is making the most noise, there are other options, including those from established vendors such as AMD and Intel that provide high-end GPUs, as well as from startups coming to market to meet the demand.\nBut Nvidia is providing more than chips for AI initiatives, Sinclair said.\n\"Nvidia has done an excellent job with its libraries and its development environment,\" he said.\nDevelopers will likely want to work with tools they are familiar with, and Nvidia's tools are well established, Sinclair said.\nAdam Armstrong is a TechTarget Editorial news writer covering file and block storage hardware and private clouds.

And with a few additional clicks, support for NVIDIA DLSS and NVIDIA Reflex can be introduced, accelerating performance and making gameplay even more responsive.\nFollowing the launch of the RTX Remix Open Beta in January, we\u2019re today introducing new features and optimizations, headlined by the addition of NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction, an AI model that creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.\nAdditionally, we\u2019re taking a look at some work in progress RTX Remix mods, and checking in with Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, to demonstrate the toolkit\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix Upgrades To DLSS 3.5 With Ray Reconstruction\nLast month, we updated Portal with RTX to add support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction. This advanced AI-powered neural renderer improves upon previously available rendering techniques to heighten the fidelity, responsiveness and quality of ray-traced effects, giving all GeForce RTX gamers an even better experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction has been added to the NVIDIA RTX Remix modding toolkit, opening the floodgates for many more classic titles with higher quality ray-traced images. With just a few clicks, RTX Remix mods can be updated to DLSS 3.5, enhancing ray tracing as in Portal with RTX.\nDLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction is especially helpful in a modding tool like RTX Remix, since it tackles a variety of content that would be normally challenging for traditional hand-tuned denoisers. Modders don\u2019t need to worry about hand-tuning environments for different scenes and lighting conditions\u2013the AI model powering Ray Reconstruction has been trained on a variety of scenarios already, and can adapt automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison from Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project\nIn addition to adding Ray Reconstruction to the Remix Open Beta, we\u2019re introducing new Toolkit and Runtime enhancements that improve mod image quality, expand compatibility, and make the modding process easier. Five of these changes come from our GitHub community, who contributed new code that has now been incorporated into Remix:\n\nMod developer \u201cpixelcluster\u201d improved how well RTX Remix mods run for Steam Deck and Linux AMD users, thanks to optimizations for RADV drivers\nMod developer \u201cmmdanggg2\u201d made improvements to the consistency of distant lights, making them update properly when changing or reorienting them\nMod developer \u201cjdswebb\u201d made improvements to how terrain baking and other features work with games that use a left-handed coordinate system\nMod developer \u201cxoxor4d\u201d made several improvements that streamline the texture tagging process, which is essential to properly setting up a game with RTX Remix\nMod developer \u201cxoxor4d\u201d also added an option to use AABBs to differentiate instances, and therefore track them better across frames. For gamers, that means less ghosting and flickering for animated objects and skinned meshes in motion. See the difference in the example from a test scenario below.\n\nIf you are a mod developer interested in collaborating with us to make RTX Remix even better, learn how to contribute code on our RTX Remix Open Source GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a modder with the RTX Remix beta, install the latest update by opening the NVIDIA Omniverse Launcher, and clicking the menu next to the \u201cLaunch\u201d button. Updating the RTX Remix Application also gives you the latest RTX Remix Runtime that contains DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction, or you can download the latest release of the RTX Remix Runtime from GitHub.\nReplace the old RTX Remix Runtime in your mod projects and give all of your players access to Ray Reconstruction by following the instructions here.\nIf you are interested in trying the RTX Remix beta for the first time, download and install the NVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta for access to all of its features, including its generative AI tools that can enhance textures by increasing their resolution and adding PBR material properties. If you\u2019re unsure what you need, or how to use RTX Remix, check out our complete Remix rundown here.\nAnd for the full release notes for the new release, head here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Remix Mod Showcase\nOn ModDB and the RTX Remix Showcase Discord, modders are uploading and documenting their in-development RTX Remix projects. These range from rtx.conf files to activate ray tracing and DLSS in classic games, all the way up to full remasters such as Portal with RTX, Portal: Prelude RTX, and Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project. Let\u2019s take a look at three work in progress RTX Remix mods below to see the community is leveraging its powerful toolkit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Messiah of Might and Magic, By wiltOS Technologies\nA small team of modders under the banner of wiltOS Technologies have been working to update Ubisoft and Arkane Studios\u2019 2006 first-person action RPG set in the Might & Magic Fantasy universe. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nTo showcase their progress, wiltOS Technologies shared exclusive new Dark Messiah of Might and Magic Co-Op & RTX Remix Mod screenshots, featuring enhanced textures, remastered models, increased geometric detail, full ray tracing, and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction. Using Ray Reconstruction, texture clarity is improved, ray tracing fidelity is enhanced, and transparency rendering is improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can follow wiltOS Technologies\u2019 progress on this fantastic-looking project on ModDB, Knockout!, YouTube, and the RTX Remix Showcase Discord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison\nIf you\u2019re a modder and want to assist the wiltOS Technologies team, reach out to project lead and creator David Wiltos on Twitter or apply directly by going to their website.

That\u2019s now changed with the release of the new Echelon Renderer from Onno Jongbloed, which adds a Remix-compatible fixed-function rendering pipeline, finally enabling gamers to enhance the much-loved classic game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough it\u2019s early days for this work in progress mod, it\u2019s already playable, select lights are now fully ray-traced, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction further improves the clarity of textures and fidelity of ray tracing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo download and play on your GeForce RTX system, follow the instructions here, and download the newest version from Github. If you\u2019re a modder and would like to collaborate with the developer on overcoming remaining challenges, head to the project\u2019s RTX Remix Showcase Discord channel.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Half-Life 2 RTX Progress Update\nHalf-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project is being developed by four of Half-Life 2\u2019s top mod teams, now working together as Orbifold Studios. Using the latest version of RTX Remix beta, the modders are rebuilding materials with PBR properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve\u2019s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3.5, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the time since our previous showcase, Orbifold Studios has been hard at work remastering the game with high-fidelity PBR assets, taking full advantage of the Remix runtime to integrate cutting-edge graphics into Half-Life 2. Utilizing Parallax Occlusion Mapping (POM), world materials like the metal walls texture seen above will have simulated depth and self-shadowing, whilst Remix's efficient polygon rendering allows for assets with polycounts many times that of the 2004 original models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out more and sign up to help the team complete the mod on the Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload The RTX Remix Beta Now\nIf you want to make your own ray-traced mod for a classic game, the NVIDIA RTX Remix Beta is available to download now with Tutorial Videos to walk you through the process.

When startup SEA.AI, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, set out to create a system that would use AI to scan the seas to enhance maritime safety, entrepreneur Raphael Biancale wasn\u2019t afraid to take the plunge. He donned a lifejacket and jumped into the ocean.\nIt\u2019s a move that demonstrates Biancale\u2019s commitment and pioneering approach. The startup, founded in 2018 and based in Linz, Austria, with subsidiaries in France, Portugal and the US, had to build its first-of-its-kind training data from scratch in order to train an AI to help oceangoers of all kinds scan the seas.\nAnd to do that, the company needed photos of what a person in the water looked like. That\u2019s when Biancale, now the company\u2019s head of research, walked the plank.\nThe company has come a long way since then, with a full product line powered by NVIDIA AI technology that lets commercial and recreational sailors detect objects on the seas, whether potential hazards or people needing rescue.\nIt\u2019s an effort inspired by Biancale\u2019s experience on a night sail. The lack of visibility and situational awareness illuminated the pressing need for advanced safety technologies in the maritime world that AI is bringing to the automotive industry.\nAI, of course, is finding its way into all things aquatic. Startup Saildrone\u2019s autonomous sailing vessels can help conduct data-gathering for science, fisheries, weather forecasting, ocean mapping and maritime security. Other researchers are using AI to interpret whale songs and even protect beachgoers from dangerous rip currents.\n\nSEA.AI, however, promises to make the seas safer for everyone who steps aboard a boat. First introduced for ocean racing sailboats, SEA.AI\u2019s system has quickly evolved into an AI-powered situational awareness system that can be deployed on everything from recreational sail and powerboats to commercial shipping vessels.\nSEA.AI directly addresses one of the most significant risks for all these vessels: collisions. Thanks to SEA.AI, commercial and recreational oceangoers worldwide can travel with more confidence.\nHow SEA.AI Works\nAt the heart of SEA.AI\u2019s approach is a proprietary database of over 9 million annotated marine objects which is growing constantly.\nWhen combined with high-tech optical sensors and the latest AI technology from NVIDIA, SEA.AI\u2019s systems can recognize and classify objects in real-time, significantly improving maritime safety.\nSEA.AI technology can detect a person in water up to 700 meters \u2014 almost half a mile \u2014 away, a dinghy up to 3,000 meters, and motorboats up to 7,500 meters.\nThis capability ensures maritime operators can identify hazards before they pose a threat. It complements older marine safety systems that rely on radar and satellite signals.\nSEA.AI solutions integrate with central marine display units from industry-leading manufacturers like Raymarine, B&G, Garmin and Furuno as well as Android and iOS-based mobile devices. This provides broad applicability across the maritime sector, from recreational vessels to commercial and government ships.\nThe NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform is integral to SEA.AI\u2019s success. The platform for robotics and embedded computing applications enables SEA.AI products to achieve unparalleled processing power and efficiency, setting a new standard in maritime safety by quickly detecting, analyzing and alerting operators to objects.\n\nAI Integration and Real-Time Object Detection\nSEA.AI uses NVIDIA\u2019s AI and machine vision technology to offer real-time object detection and classification, providing maritime operators with immediate identification of potential hazards.\nSEA.AI is bringing its approach to oceangoers of all kinds with three product lines.\nOne, SEA.AI Sentry, provides 360-degree situational awareness for commercial vessels and motor yachts with features like collision avoidance, object tracking and perimeter surveillance.\nAnother, SEA.AI Offshore,\u00a0 provides bluewater sailors with high-tech safety and convenience with simplified installation across several editions that can suit different detection and technical needs.\nThe third, SEA.AI Competition, offers reliable object detection for ocean racing and performance yacht sailors. Its ultra-lightweight design ensures maximum performance when navigating at high speeds.\nWith a growing team of more than 60 and a distribution network spanning over 40 countries, SEA.AI is charting a course to help ensure every journey on the waves is safer.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Metropolis | NVIDIA Jetson | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

[+] Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Getty Images\nNvidia\u2019s boffo quarterly earnings report last April set in motion a global fever for generative AI stocks.\n\nAs the anniversary of that report \u2014 which featured unexpectedly high demand by cloud service providers for Nvidia\u2019s GPU \u2014 approaches, has Nvidia stock peaked? Or could the stock rise to a new high on May 22, when the company delivers its fiscal year 2025 first-quarter results?\n\n\nWhile possible rival products and high investor expectations could drive down Nvidia\u2019s stock price, I favor the view of optimists such as Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, who raised to $1,000 his price target on the GPU maker\u2019s stock, according to InvestorPlace.\n\nHere are the reasons for optimism:\n\n\n\nExpectations-beating performance in the last year;\nHyperscalers\u2019 big GPU investments;\nNvidia\u2019s strong market position and competitive advantages; and\nThe company\u2019s new generative AI inference product.\n\n\n\nThe biggest obstacle to Nvidia\u2019s stock price topping $1,000 is the company\u2019s recent success. How so? Every quarter in which Nvidia exceeds expectations and raises guidance, investors expect even more of the same for the next quarter.\nAnalysts expect the company to keep doing that for at least the next year or two. If they are right, Nvidia\u2019s stock will keep rising.ForbesNvidia Stock Is Up 150% And 3 Key Advantages Could Keep It RisingBy Peter Cohan\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nNvidia\u2019s Expectations-Beating Performance In the Last 4 Quarters\nIf a company exceeds Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings in the most recent three months and raises guidance for the future, the stock usually rises. If the company falls short of those results, the stock falls.\n\nBearing that rule in mind, the 236% pop in Nvidia\u2019s stock price in 2023 and its 79% rise so far in 2024 do not come as a shock. According to Nasdaq, Nvidia \u2014 whose fiscal year 2024 ended in January \u2014 has surprised on the upside in each of the four most recent quarters:\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year 2024 Q1 earnings per share: 88 cents \u2014 44.3% above investor expectations\nFY 2024 Q2 EPS: $2.50 \u2014 38.9% beat\nFY 2024 Q3 EPS: $3.77 \u2014 24.4% beat\nFY 2024 Q4 EPS: $4.91 \u2014 16.6% beat\n\n\nThese numbers reveal a disturbing trend for Nvidia bulls: The extent to which Nvidia\u2019s earnings exceed investor expectations is steadily dropping. If the recent trend continues \u2014 an 8 percentage-point-per-quarter drop in Nvidia\u2019s beat \u2014 Nvidia could fall short of what Wall Street expects later this year.ForbesNvidia Stock Tops $1,000 As Blackwell Could Aid Tenfold Rise By 2026By Peter Cohan\nStrong Demand For Nvidia\u2019s GPUs As Margins Rise\nUnderlying Nvidia\u2019s stock price increase is soaring demand for the company\u2019s GPUs. Demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI-focused chips soared 410% to $18.4 billion in the January 2024-ending quarter. Big customers include:\n\n\nMicrosoft \u2014 is launching Stargate, a $100 billion data-center project, according to TheStreet.com;\nGoogle\nGOOG\n \u2014 is earmarking $50 billion for AI and cloud initiatives, TheStreet.com reports; and\nMeta Platforms\nFB\n \u2014 plans to buy 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, bringing its total H100 count to 600,000 by the end of 2024, as per TheStreet.com.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s gross margins have also increased. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins improved 12 percentage points to 76% and are expected to rise to 77% in Nvidia\u2019s first quarter of FY 2025, noted TheStreet.com.ForbesNvidia Stock Could Rise 10-Fold On New $10 Billion Growth VectorBy Peter Cohan\nNvidia\u2019s Sustainable Competitive Advantages\nNvidia\u2019s combination of chips and developer software constitute barriers to entry which are difficult for rivals to surmount. Over the last 15 years, Nvidia\u2019s share of the AI chip industry has reached somewhere between 80% and 95%, as I wrote in my February 2024 Forbes article.\nAs I said then, signs of Nvidia\u2019s market power include:\n\n\nCustomers are willing to pay a significant price premium and to wait for over a year to obtain Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nNvidia chips are expensive; however, Nvidia says they enable companies to save time training their large language models \u2014 which more than offsets the price premium.\nDevelopers build on Nvidia first. Rivals who copy Nvidia hardware are always racing to catch up.\n\n\nHere are Nvidia\u2019s most important sources of competitive advantage:\n\n\nLaunching and improving CUDA. In 2006, Nvidia announced CUDA \u2014 software for programming GPUs for other fields such as physics or chemical simulation. In 2012, researchers used the chips to identify a cat with precision, according to The New York Times\nNYT\n.\nHiring an AI team. Nvidia hired a team to train large language models \u2014 gaining early insights into what AI practitioners wanted. Using that market intelligence, Nvidia built libraries \u2014 to perform tasks common to AI development \u2014 thus saving the developers\u2019 time, the Times noted.\nBuilding faster chips every few years and expanding to complete computers. Nvidia consistently delivered faster chips every few years. In 2017, it began tailoring GPUs to handle specific AI calculations, sold chips or circuit boards for other companies, and provided complete computers aimed at faster AI processing, wrote the Times.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s New Blackwell GPU Raises The Bar\nTo be sure, rivals such as AMD, Intel, and Google are announcing efforts aimed at winning market share from Nvidia, according to InvestorPlace.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantages are formidable, the company has been considered vulnerable in the market for chips that perform inferencing \u2014 enabling AI chatbots to respond to user prompts, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nLast month, Nvidia announced Blackwell GPU, a new chip architecture for inferencing. These so-called B100 chips work more than two times faster than the company\u2019s current offerings and Nvidia expects to charge 40% more \u2014 between $30,000 to $40,000 per unit \u2014 than it does for the H100, according to TheStreet.com.\nAnalysts reacted positively to the B100 news. The UBS analyst Tim Arcuri said Nvidia\u2019s new chips, \u201cwill reassert its undisputed technical lead in performance,\u201d while the Bank of America\nBAC\n securities analyst Vivek Arya said in a note to clients featured in the Journal, the B100 and other recent developments, \u201ccontinue to fundamentally widen Nvidia\u2019s competitive moat.\u201d\nHigh Fiscal Year Q1 2025 Performance Expectations\nNvidia stock has lost about 8% of its value since peaking in late March.\nWhen Nvidia reports fiscal first quarter 2025 earnings the GPU designer\u2019s stock price will soar or plunge depending on whether its results and forecast are better than consensus estimates.\nHere are the key numbers investors are looking for from Nvidia, according to TheStreet.com:\n\n\nFY 2025 Q1 net sales forecast: $24.22 billion \u2014 237% more than the year before, according to Yahoo! Finance\nFY 2025 Q1 gross margin forecast: 77.03% \u2014 13 percentage points more than the year before, Yahoo! Finance notes.\nFY 2025 Q1 adjusted earnings per share forecast: $5.50 \u2014 405% higher than the year before, according to CNBC.\n\n\nIn February, Nvidia guided investors to expect 300% revenue growth to $24 billion in Q1 2025 \u2014 $2.4 billion more than the analysts\u2019 consensus, I wrote in February.\nWill Nvidia raise its Q2 2025 revenue growth guidance above 300%? Analysts have lower expectations for Nvidia\u2019s FY 2025 revenue growth and gross margins. They forecast Nvidia revenue will grow 82% to $11 billion while gross margins will \u201cstabilize at 75.83%,\u201d according to TheStreet.com.\nWhat Analysts Expect From Nvidia\u2019s Stock Price\nHas Nvidia stock passed its peak? The average price target of 41 analysts suggests 13.7% upside with a 12-month price target of $989, according to TipRanks.\nMany analysts expect Nvidia stock to rise:\n\n\nUBS\u2019 Nvidia price target: $1,100 per share according to the analyst Timothy Arcuri, who said following the company\u2019s Blackwell launch, \"We believe Nvidia sits on the cusp of an entirely new wave of demand from global enterprises and sovereigns \u2014 with each sovereign potentially as big as a large U.S. cloud customer,\u201d noted Investor\u2019s Business Daily\nTruist Nvidia price target: $1,177 noted the analyst William Stein, who sees \u201cstronger demand in 2024 and 2025,\u201d reported IBD\nIBD\n.\nHSBC\nHBA\nNvidia price target: $1,050, and\nBank of America Nvidia price target: $1,100, IBD wrote.\n\n\nNot all analysts are bullish. \u201cAlthough NVDA (Neutral-rated) should deliver a spectacular 2024 (and perhaps into 2025), we continue to believe recent trends set up a significant cyclical downturn by 2026,\u201d D.A. Davidson analysts said in the note Tuesday featured in a CNBC report.\n\u201cA combination of shrinking models, more steady growth in demand, maturing hyperscaler investments, and increased reliance by their largest customers on their own chips do not bode well for NVDA\u2019s out years,\u201d CNBC noted.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Large language models (LLMs) power AI chatbots like ChatGPT.AdvertisementRelated ContentNvidia and Google stock rise while Meta and TSMC fall after Trump's election winMicrosoft is turning to Intel \u2014 not Nvidia \u2014 to make more chipsRelated ContentNvidia and Google stock rise while Meta and TSMC fall after Trump's election winMicrosoft is turning to Intel \u2014 not Nvidia \u2014 to make more chips\u201cNow in their fifth generation, these advancements [to Google\u2019s TPUs] have helped customers train and serve cutting edge language models,\u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the company\u2019s annual Google Cloud Next conference on Tuesday in Las Vegas.AdvertisementGoogle\u2019s announcement was another milestone in Big Tech\u2019s AI arms race. Nvidia is the main supplier of the AI chips known as GPUs, or graphics processing units. And Google parent Alphabet is one of Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers, behind Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.Advertisement\u201c[Google\u2019s] investments [to develop new AI hardware] put us at the forefront of the AI platform shift,\u201d Pichai said.Google\u2019s rivals Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have also developed\u00a0their own AI chips.AdvertisementStill, it\u2019s clear that Nvidia is very important to Google. In the same blog post announcing its latest AI chip, Google mentioned Nvidia 20 times. Right under its detailing of the TPU v5p, the company said it\u2019s updating its A3 supercomputer, which runs on Nvidia GPUs. And Google reminded customers that it\u2019s using Nvidia\u2019s latest chip, the Blackwell, in its AI Hypercomputer.Read more: Intel says its new AI hardware is \u2018way ahead of Nvidia\u2019After discussing Google\u2019s new AI chip, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian gave a flashier presentation of its new, Arm-based central processing unit called Google Axion. In a game show-esque reveal, Kurian walked the stage during his keynote address with the Axion in hand, flashing the chip to applause.AdvertisementGoogle Axion is a new rival to the CPUs of Microsoft and Amazon, which have already made their own Arm-based computing chips. The British tech company Arm licenses its chip infrastructure design for actual chip manufacturers to build upon. Google\u2019s release of Axion marks the first time the company has used Arm\u2019s chip infrastructure for a CPU.Google said Axion provides \u201cup to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today\u201d and \u201cup to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency\u201d than other general purpose Arm chips.AdvertisementGoogle customers can use Axion on its cloud services, which basically means those users would be opting to run their cloud services on a more efficient computer processor in Google\u2019s physical data centers. Google also told Reuters that \u201ccustomers using Arm anywhere can easily adopt Axion without re-architecting or re-writing their apps.\u201d\ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily BriefOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

With customer demand outpacing staffing capacity, businesses are relying on automated, real-time communication tools to assist human agents and support customers.\nGenerative AI-powered applications that are trained in domain-specific languages and enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can deliver more accurate, personalized, and context-aware interactions far beyond what traditional solutions can provide. Solutions such as AI virtual assistants, AI chatbots, or digital agents dynamically adapt to evolving customer needs and engage in human-like conversation. This level of sophistication and intelligence will ultimately help businesses scale customer service efficiently and maintain high customer satisfaction without compromising on quality. \nTo create more interactive and engaging customer service experiences, low-latency performance is crucial for lifelike conversations with digital human agents. With the necessary computational power to train and refine deep learning models, businesses can deliver seamless, responsive AI-driven interactions that continuously improve over time. \nTelecommunications\nTelecommunications companies need to deliver exceptional customer service while maintaining high network availability, performance, and security\u2014all essential for running applications and services. This comes at a time when the industry is investing heavily in 5G and the expansion of fiber networks, significantly increasing capital expenditures. The challenge is providing accurate, reliable support through well-informed customer service agents.\nIn NVIDIA\u2019s 2024 State of AI in Telecommunications report,\u00a057% of telecom companies confirmed use of generative AI to improve customer service and support employee productivity. These enterprises are invested in call centers and improving end-to-end customer experiences, including order orchestration, order management, and case summarization. Improvement in customer experiences not only yields cost savings\u2014it also increases revenue opportunities.\nFinancial Services\nGenerative AI is improving how consumers handle a range of financial transactions, including bill payments, money transfers, and opening new accounts. From call center transcription to intelligent chatbots, AI is helping remove barriers to customer support and reduce friction to execute common banking tasks. By providing self-service capabilities, banks can free-up customer service agents to concentrate on more complex, higher value interactions and transactions.\nGenerative AI also enhances customer service with personalized financial plans and investment recommendations and virtual assistants that can answer a wider array of customer inquiries than traditional chatbots. \nAccording to NVIDIA\u2019s 2024 State of AI in Financial Services survey report, 34% of respondents are exploring generative AI and large language models (LLMs) for customer experience and engagement. This suggests that financial services institutions are exploring chatbots, virtual assistants and recommendation systems to enhance the customer experience.\nRetail\nAs the retail industry evolves, traditional approaches can often lead to customer frustration and lost sales opportunities.

2024\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0|\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u00a0plans to acquire Israeli startup\u00a0Run:ai, a Kubernetes-based workload management and orchestration software provider.\nThe chipmaker said in a Wednesday (April 24) blog post\u00a0that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Run:ai, adding that the deal will help customers make more efficient use of their artificial intelligence (AI) computing resources.\n\u201cRun:ai\u00a0enables enterprise customers to manage and optimize their compute infrastructure, whether\u00a0on premises, in the cloud\u00a0or\u00a0in\u00a0hybrid environments,\u201d Nvidia said in the post.\nThis move comes at a time when customers\u2019 AI deployments are becoming increasingly complex, as workloads are distributed across cloud, edge\u00a0and\u00a0on-premises data center infrastructure, according to the post.\nIt takes sophisticated scheduling to optimize performance when managing and orchestrating generative AI, recommender systems, search engines\u00a0and\u00a0other workloads, the post said.\nRun:ai\u00a0helps enterprises accomplish this using an open platform on Kubernetes that supports all popular Kubernetes variants and integrates with third-party AI tools and frameworks per the post.\n\u201cRun:ai\u00a0has been a close collaborator with Nvidia since 2020 and we share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,\u201d\u00a0Omri Geller, co-founder and CEO of Run:ai, said in the post. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to join Nvidia and look forward to continuing our journey together.\u201d\nIt was reported in March that Nvidia was in talks to acquire\u00a0Run:ai.\nIn another recent move, Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) said in March that they extended their 13-year collaboration to advance\u00a0generative AI.\nThis partnership aims to bring the new Nvidia Blackwell GPU platform to AWS, offering customers secure and advanced infrastructure, software\u00a0and\u00a0services.\n\u201cOur collaboration with AWS is accelerating new generative AI capabilities and providing customers with unprecedented computing power to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible,\u201d\u00a0Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said at the time in a press release.\nIn addition, Nvidia has been investing in smaller\u00a0AI firms, pursuing its growth strategy\u00a0and\u00a0boosting its growing influence in the AI world.\nInvestors view Nvidia\u2019s involvement in these smaller firms as a positive sign, which can help the companies raise capital.\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management

Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws invites players to experience the Star Wars galaxy like never before through an original story set between Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2122 and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\u2122.\nAs the Galactic Empire relentlessly pursues the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance, the criminal underworld thrives. Fans will play as cunning scoundrel Kay Vess and her loyal companion Nix, as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen. Seeking the means to start a new life, players will join Kay and Nix as they fight, steal, and outwit their way through the galaxy\u2019s crime syndicates and join the galaxy\u2019s most wanted.\nTo celebrate the game\u2019s upcoming release, Ubisoft shared a new story trailer:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA has partnered with Ubisoft and LucasFilm Games to deliver the definitive PC experience for Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws players, leveraging the game-changing technologies of GeForce RTX GPUs to enhance graphics, accelerate performance, and make gameplay even more responsive.\nThe second Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws launches on August 30th, GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA DLSS 3, multiplying performance with DLSS Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and boosting performance considerably with DLSS Super Resolution on all other GeForce RTX GPUs.\nAdditionally, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency in Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws. System latency affects the time it takes for actions to occur in-game - the lower your latency, the more responsive a game becomes, and the better the gameplay feels. Available in over 100 games, Reflex is used by over 50 million users each month, and with there being no downsides to the tech whatsoever, it\u2019s a must-have for gamers wanting the most responsive experience possible.\nStar Wars\u2122 Outlaws is built using Massive Entertainment\u2019s incredible Snowdrop Engine, enabling the developers to create the most detailed Star Wars\u2122 experience you\u2019ve ever seen, with perfectly recreated ships and iconic locations, and stunning worlds for you to visit and experience. \u00a0\nAs part of our collaboration, Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws on PC is also being enhanced with NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI), plus ray-traced reflections and ray-traced global illumination, taking visuals to the next level. RTXDI figures out the most important light samples in Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws to cast physically accurate ray-traced shadows. Performance remains fast thanks to RTXDI\u2019s innovative design, and on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs ray tracing gets even faster thanks to each card\u2019s fourth generation, super fast Ray Tracing Cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still enjoy Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws by streaming it from the cloud with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3 and Reflex, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate. Members can play over 1,800 of the real and full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com. Head over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\nAnd stay tuned to GeForce.com for more information about Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws running on the PC and GeForce RTX GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRIBES 3: Rivals Out Now With DLSS 2 & DLAA\nProphecy Games\u2019 TRIBES 3: Rivals is a team-based first person shooter that elevates the genre with jetpacks, skiing, and class-based warfare. Players ski, jetpack, battle, and race to capture the enemy team\u2019s flag, all while ferociously defending their own. Players can choose from unique classes to customize their abilities, perks, and weapon loadouts, while moving across epic terrains from snow covered peaks to haunting deserts. Teamwork, tactics, high speed, and intense combat reign supreme in this rebirth of the world\u2019s fastest shooter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable now in Early Access, TRIBES 3: Rivals includes support for DLSS 2, helping up your frame rate, for faster, smoother gameplay in lightning-speed matches. Please note, when enabling DLSS you\u2019ll need to manually adjust the Resolution Scaling option to increase performance - for DLSS Performance Mode at 4K, set the slider to 50%; at 1080p and 1440p, set it to 66% for DLSS Quality Mode.\nAlternatively, enable DLAA to take image quality to 11. DLAA is an AI-based anti-aliasing mode that utilizes the same technology developed for DLSS, but instead uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance, for an even richer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Outlast Trials Available Now With DLSS 2\nRed Barrels\u2019 survival horror franchise, Outlast, is beloved by gamers, and recently Red Barrels\u2019 The Outlast Trials exited Early Access, inviting players to survive hellish \u2018therapies\u2019, either alone or in co-op. Choose tools, perks and upgrades to give yourself an advantage, and to delay the horrors that chase you through the Murkoff Corporation\u2019s testing site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom your first fright, you\u2019ll have the fastest gaming experience possible thanks to the day-one inclusion of NVIDIA DLSS 2. Head to the game\u2019s Steam page to join the trials today with up to three friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS & RTX Screenshot Pro Showcase\nAdvanced screenshotting pros, often referred to as Digital Artists or Virtual Photographers, showcase a game\u2019s artistic and creative brilliance via their unique, jaw-dropping screen captures.\nYou can find screenshots and videos from the community using #VirtualPhotography, #Gametography, #photomode, #RTXON, and other tags on X, Instagram and other social networks. Below, we\u2019re sharing some select shots of RTX games from popular Digital Artists, with permission.

As the Galactic Empire relentlessly pursues the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance, the criminal underworld thrives. Fans will play as cunning scoundrel Kay Vess and her loyal companion Nix, as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen. Seeking the means to start a new life, players will join Kay and Nix as they fight, steal, and outwit their way through the galaxy\u2019s crime syndicates and join the galaxy\u2019s most wanted.\nKay and Nix can turn any situation to their advantage: use stealth and gadgets to gain the upper hand, use Nix to distract and draw away enemies, or engage in blaster combat in tense situations throughout their journey. In order to pull off the ultimate heist, Kay and Nix will search for and join forces with a cast of outlaws, including battle-hardened droid ND-5. While stealing valuable goods, infiltrating secret locations, and outwitting enemies, they will need to carefully consider how their choices affect their status with each syndicate, as each move will influence Kay\u2019s ever-changing reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral data center, colocation, and interconnection solutions, today announced that it has been selected to host one of the world's most powerful AI supercomputers at an AI-ready data center in Copenhagen, Denmark. This collaboration, spearheaded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Export and Investment Fund of Denmark (EIFO), will grant researchers from Denmark's public and private sectors access to a cutting-edge NVIDIA-powered AI supercomputer, in addition to NVIDIA software platforms, training, and expertise.\nThe state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u00a0supercomputer is equipped with 191 NVIDIA\u00a0DGX H100\u00a0systems integrating over 1,500 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and interconnected using the NVIDIA\u00a0\u00a0Quantum-2 InfiniBand\u00a0networking platform. The DGX SuperPOD also includes NVIDIA AI Enterprise software for pretrained models, optimized frameworks, and accelerated data science software libraries. Digital Realty's advanced, AI-ready infrastructure will provide the foundation for this powerful system, enabling the National Center for AI Innovation \u2013 formed through the collaboration \u2013 in Denmark to accelerate research and innovation in various fields, including healthcare, life sciences, and climate research.\nChris Sharp, Chief Technology Officer at Digital Realty, commented, \"Digital Realty is at the forefront of crafting the digital future, transcending mere infrastructure development to become architects of tomorrow. Our commitment to delivering state-of-the-art, AI-ready infrastructure is not just about accelerating AI adoption \u2013 it's about pioneering the next wave of innovation. We envision Digital Realty as more than a meeting place for AI; we aim to establish it as the premier nexus for private AI, where enterprises and data converge. Here, scientific breakthroughs are realized, industries are transformed, and the future is molded by the synergy of technology and imagination.\"\nDigital Realty's dedication to supporting AI adoption is evident through its recent initiatives. Last year, the company introduced its high-density colocation solution on PlatformDIGITAL\u00ae, the company's global data center platform, aimed at breaking down barriers and facilitating AI adoption by enterprises worldwide. Moreover, Digital Realty's KIX13 data center in Osaka, Japan, was Digital Realty's first data center globally to become certified\u00a0for NVIDIA DGX H100, as part of the NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program.\n\"We are delighted to be working with Digital Realty,\" said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Chief Executive Officer of the Novo Nordisk Foundation. \"With their superb track record of operational excellence and tangible commitment to sustainability, they are the ideal partner to host the supercomputer and help take this exciting initiative forward.\"\nThe supercomputer will be housed in one of Digital Realty's state-of-the-art data centers in Copenhagen, which have been powered by 100% renewable energy since 2020. Digital Realty has more than one gigawatt of renewable energy under contract globally and is a signatory to the EU Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact, committing to carbon neutrality for its European data centers by 2030.\nThis collaboration between Digital Realty, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, EIFO, and NVIDIA marks a significant milestone in Denmark's AI research and innovation landscape.

Driven by his passion for learning and desire to help people through medicine, he joined NVIDIA in 2021 after graduating from Weill Cornell Medicine at Cornell University with a doctorate in computational biology and medicine.\n\nHis first tasks on the job involved working on NVIDIA Parabricks, a suite of accelerated genomics tools, where he made full use of his bioinformatics background. Later, with the support of his team, the ever-curious Ricketts jumped at the chance to participate in a deep learning rotation. That project eventually became one of the core features of NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI platform for drug discovery.\nIn his current role as a BioNeMo research scientist, Ricketts develops large language models across cheminformatics, proteins and genomics \u2014 the area in which he has the greatest interest.\n\u201cOur work enables research, pharma and biotech to be more efficient and better predict small molecules and protein structure,\u201d Ricketts said. \u201cIf we can use deep learning to make the process more efficient and accurate, we can go from problem to cure much faster.\u201d\nBefore joining NVIDIA, Ricketts viewed himself as a scientist, so his current work as an engineer has caused a shift in identity \u2014 one that he\u2019s learning to embrace.\n\n\u201cAt NVIDIA, my role is hybrid \u2014 I get to be a scientist; I discover, explore, run experiments and push for invention,\u201d he said. \u201cI also get to be an engineer and turn the experiments into real products that will have real impact today. It\u2019s such a privilege to be able to do both.\u201d\nRicketts\u2019 desire to help people extends beyond the medical realm. Originally from Jamaica, Ricketts came to the U.S. in 2011 to attend the University of Georgia, where he was awarded the school\u2019s top academic scholarship, the Foundation Fellowship.\nLed by a passion to give back to his home country, he started a nonprofit in 2019 called MindsOf Initiative, which aims to broaden access to mentorship for Caribbean students. More than 300 students have participated in the mentorship program, including 60 who have taken a bioinformatics training program led by Ricketts.\n\u201cHaving people invest in your success can change your life for the better,\u201d he said.\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The rack scale system integrates 72 next-generation Blackwell GPUs connected by NVLink to form \u201c1 Giant GPU.\u201d Jensen\u2019s description of the NVLink passive-copper \u201cbackplane\u201d caused a brief panic among investors that believed it somehow replaced InfiniBand, which it does not. The NVL72 represents next-generation AI systems, but Nvidia also revealed new details of its deployed Hopper-generation clusters. Next generation 800G (XDR) InfiniBand won\u2019t reach customers until 2025, so early Blackwell systems will use 400G (NDR) InfiniBand instead.Photo by LightCountingJensen said the Hopper-generation EOS supercomputer had just come online. This cluster uses 608 NDR switches with 64 ports each for a total of 38,912 switch ports. This system places the leaf switches in racks at the end of the row, so all InfiniBand links employ optical transceivers. We estimate the servers add 5,120 ports for a system total of 44,032 NDR ports. Because Nvidia uses what it calls \u201ctwin-port OSFP\u201d 800G transceivers, each transceiver serves two NDR ports. Thus, we estimate the complete EOS system uses about 22,000 800G optical transceivers.Blackwell-generation GPUs include 5th-generation NVLink, which doubles the interconnect bandwidth compared with Hopper. It does this by doubling the per-lane speed to 200Gbps, which results in 400Gbps of unidirectional bandwidth for each NVLink x2 port. Each Blackwell GPU includes 18 ports, which deliver 1.8TB/s (14.4Tbps) of aggregate bidirectional bandwidth. To connect 72 GPUs in the NVL72 rack, Nvidia developed the NVLink5 switch chip. The NVL72 rack includes nine NVLink switch trays with two ASICs each. Using 5,184 passive-copper (DAC) cables, the switches deliver all-to-all GPU connectivity within the rack.Perhaps the biggest GTC 2024 disappointment for the networking ecosystem was the revelation that 800G InfiniBand is delayed until 2025. Despite the delay, the company disclosed the Quantum-X800 switch system and ConnectX-8 adapter (NIC). When available, these 800G InfiniBand products will double per-GPU bandwidth, as ConnectX-8 NICs will replace ConnectX-7 (400G) NICs one-for-one. They should also be first to handle optics with 200G lanes on the electrical (host) side, driving early demand for second-generation 200G/lambda DSPs.Full text of the research note is available to LightCounting clients at: https://www.lightcounting.com/login\nPrice: $595\nADD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReady to connect with LightCounting?\nEnabling effective decision-making based on a unique combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis.\n                                    \n                      Reach us at info@lightcounting.com\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2025 LightCounting.

But unlike companies in the dot-com era, Nvidia is supported by strong business fundamentals \u2014 the company posted first-quarter revenue growth of 270% over 2023 \u2014 that have Wall Street coming back for more. The $2 trillion dollar company had humble beginnings. Its now-billionaire founder and CEO Jensen Huang worked as a dishwasher to make money as a teenager, and the company almost went bankrupt in its first two years. Now Nvidia stock is up a whopping 87% so far in 2024, 223% over the last 12 months, 1,793% over the last five years.Let\u2019s take a look at Nvidia\u2019s rise from its start at a Denny\u2019s restaurant to the third-most valuable company on earth.AdvertisementPrevious SlideNext Slide2 / 9List slides1993: Nvidia starts with pancakesList slides1993: Nvidia starts with pancakesAn aerial view of a Denny\u2019s restaurant in Emeryville, California.Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)Jensen Huang and his friends, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, decide to start Nvidia over a meal at Denny\u2019s \u2014 the chain where Huang worked as a dishwasher during his teenage years.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  To address the shift to electric vehicles, increased semiconductor demand, manufacturing onshoring, and ambitions for greater sustainability, manufacturers are investing in new factory developments and re-engineering their existing facilities.\nThese projects often run over budget and schedule, due to complex and manual planning processes, legacy technology infrastructure, and disconnected tools, data and teams.\nVirtual factories and digitalization address these challenges, and manufacturers are embracing them. A virtual factory, powered by technologies like digital twins, the Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) ecosystem and generative AI, can enable new possibilities, from planning to operations.\nWhat Is a Virtual Factory?\nA virtual factory is a physically accurate representation of a real factory. These digital twins of factories allow manufacturers to model, simulate, analyze and optimize their production processes, resources and operations without the need for a physical prototype or pilot plant.\nBenefits of Virtual Factories\nVirtual factories unlock many benefits and possibilities for manufacturers, including:\n\nStreamlined Communication: Instead of teams relying on in-person meetings and static planning documents for project alignment, virtual factories streamline communication and ensure that critical design and operations decisions are informed by the most current data.\nContextualized Planning: During facility design, construction and commissioning, virtual factories allow project stakeholders to visualize designs in the context of the entire facility and production process. Planning and operations teams can compare and verify built structures with the virtual designs in real time and decrease costs by identifying errors and incorporating feedback early in the review process.\nOptimized Facility Designs: Connecting virtual factories to simulations of processes and discrete events enables teams to optimize facility designs for production and material flow, ergonomic work design, safety and overall utilization.\nIntelligent and Optimized Operations: Operations teams can integrate their virtual factories with valuable production data from Internet of Things technology at the edge, and tap AI to drive further optimizations.\n\nVirtual Factories: A Testing Ground for AI and Robotics\nRobotics developers are increasingly using virtual factories to train and test AI and autonomous systems that run in physical factories. For example, virtual factories can enable developers and manufacturing teams to simulate digital workers and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), vision AI agents and sensors to create a centralized map of worker activity throughout a facility. By fusing data from simulated camera streams with multi-camera tracking, developers can generate occupancy maps that inform optimal AMR routes.\nDevelopers can also use these physically accurate virtual factories to train and test AI agents capable of managing their robot fleets, to ensure AI-enabled robots can adapt to real-world unpredictability and to identify streamlined configurations for human-robot collaboration.\n\nWhat Are the Foundations of a Virtual Factory\nBuilding large-scale, physically accurate virtual factories that unlock these transformational possibilities requires bringing together many tools, data formats and technologies to harmonize the representation of real-world aspects in the digital world.\nOriginally invented by Pixar Animation Studios, OpenUSD encompasses a collection of tools and capabilities that enable the data interoperability developers and manufacturers require to achieve their digitalization goals.\nOpenUSD\u2019s core superpower is flexible data modeling. 3D input can be accepted from source applications and combined with a variety of data, including from computer-aided design software, live sensors, documentation and maintenance records, through a unified data pipeline. OpenUSD enables developers to share these data types across different simulation tools and AI models, providing insights for all stakeholders. Data can be synced from the factory floor to the digital twin, surfacing real-time insights for factory managers and teams.\nBy developing virtual factory solutions on OpenUSD, developers can enhance collaboration for factory teams, allowing them to review plans, discuss optimization opportunities and make decisions in real time.\nTo support and accelerate the development of the OpenUSD ecosystem, Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk and NVIDIA formed the Alliance for OpenUSD, which is building open standards for USD in core specification, materials, geometry and more.\nIndustrial Use Cases for Virtual Factories\nTo unlock the potential of virtual factories, industry leaders including Autodesk, Continental, Pegatron, Rockwell Automation, Siemens and Wistron are developing virtual-factory solutions that interoperate with OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits that enable developers to build applications for complex 3D and industrial digitalization workflows based on OpenUSD.\nFlexSim, an Autodesk company, uses OpenUSD to enable factory teams to analyze, visualize and optimize real-world processes with its simulation modeling for complex systems and operations. The discrete-event simulation software provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to create 3D simulation models, account for real-world variability, run \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios and perform in-depth analyses.\nDevelopers at Continental, a leading German automotive technology company, developed ContiVerse, a factory planning and manufacturing operations application on OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse. The application helps Continental optimize factory layouts and plan production processes collaboratively, leading to an expected 13% reduction in time to market.\u00a0\nPartnering with IT consulting and digital services provider SoftServe, Continental also developed Industrial Co-Pilot, which combines AI-driven insights with immersive visualization to deliver real-time guidance and predictive analytics to engineers. This is expected to reduce maintenance effort and downtime by 10%.\nPegatron, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of smartphones and consumer electronics, is developing virtual-factory solutions on OpenUSD to accelerate the development of new factories \u2014 as well as to minimize change orders, optimize operations and maximize production-line throughput in existing facilities.\nRockwell Automation is integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs and OpenUSD with its Emulate3D digital twin software to bring manufacturing teams data interoperability, live collaboration and physically based visualization for designing, building and operating industrial-scale digital twins of production systems.\nSiemens, a leading technology company for automation, digitalization and sustainability and a member of the Alliance for OpenUSD, is adopting Omniverse Cloud APIs within its Siemens Xcelerator Platform, starting with Teamcenter X, the industry-leading cloud-based product lifecycle management software.

This advanced AI-powered neural renderer is a groundbreaking feature that elevates ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs, outclassing traditional hand-tuned denoisers by using an AI network trained by an NVIDIA supercomputer. The result improves lighting effects like reflections, global illumination, and shadows to create a more immersive, realistic gaming experience.\nA Ray of Light\nRay tracing is a rendering technique that can realistically simulate the lighting of a scene and its objects by rendering physically accurate reflections, refractions, shadows and indirect lighting. Ray tracing generates computer graphics images by tracing the path of light from the view camera \u2014 which determines the view into the scene \u2014 through the 2D viewing plane, out into the 3D scene, and back to the light sources. For instance, if rays strike a mirror, reflections are generated.\nA visualization of how ray tracing works.\nIt\u2019s the digital equivalent to real-world objects illuminated by beams of light and the path of the light being followed from the eye of the viewer to the objects that light interacts with. That\u2019s ray tracing.\nSimulating light in this manner \u2014 shooting rays for every pixel on the screen \u2014 is computationally intensive, even for offline renderers that calculate scenes over the course of several minutes or hours. Instead, ray samples fire a handful of rays at various points across the scene for a representative sample of the scene\u2019s lighting, reflectivity and shadowing.\nHowever, there are limitations. The output is a noisy, speckled image with gaps, good enough to ascertain how the scene should look when ray traced. To fill in the missing pixels that weren\u2019t ray traced, hand-tuned denoisers use two different methods, temporally accumulating pixels across multiple frames, and spatially interpolating them to blend neighboring pixels together. Through this process, the noisy raw output is converted into a ray-traced image.\nThis adds complexity and cost to the development process, and reduces the frame rate in highly ray-traced games where multiple denoisers operate simultaneously for different lighting effects.\nDLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction introduces an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained, AI-powered neural network that generates higher-quality pixels in between the sampled rays. It recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and retains high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling. And it recognizes lighting patterns from its training data, such as that of global illumination or ambient occlusion, and recreates it in-game.\n\nPortal with RTX is a great example of Ray Reconstruction in action. With DLSS OFF, the denoiser struggles to reconstruct the dynamic shadowing alongside the moving fan.\nWith DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction enabled, the denoiser is trained on AI and recognizes certain patterns associated with shadows and keeps the image stable, accumulating accurate pixels while blending neighboring pixels to generate high-quality reflections.\nDeep Learning, Deep Gaming\nRay Reconstruction is just one of the AI graphics breakthroughs that multiply performance in DLSS. Super Resolution, the cornerstone of DLSS, samples multiple lower resolution images and uses motion data and feedback from prior frames to reconstruct native-quality images. The result is high image quality without sacrificing game performance.\n\nDLSS 3 introduced Frame Generation, which boosts performance by using AI to analyze data from surrounding frames to predict what the next generated frame should look like. These generated frames are then inserted in between rendered frames. Combining the DLSS-generated frames with DLSS Super Resolution enables DLSS 3 to reconstruct seven-eighths of the displayed pixels with AI, boosting frame rates by up to 4x compared to without DLSS.\nBecause DLSS Frame Generation is post-processed (applied after the main render) on the GPU, it can boost frame rates even when the game is bottlenecked by the CPU.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

Image courtesy of Oregon State University.\nThose innovations have world-changing implications.\nHuang said those who know a programming language such as C++ typically have greater opportunities.\n\u201cBecause programming is so hard, the number of people who have benefitted from this, putting it to use for their economic prosperity, has been limited,\u201d Huang said.\nAI unlocks that and more.\n\u201cSo you essentially have a collaborator with you at all times, essentially have a tutor at all times, and so I think the ability for AI to elevate all of the people left behind is quite extraordinary,\u201d he added.\nHuang\u2019s appearance in Corvallis, Oregon, capped off a week of announcements underscoring NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to preparing the future workforce with advanced AI, data science and high performance computing training.\nOn Tuesday, NVIDIA announced that it would participate in a $110 million partnership between Japan and the United States, which would include funding for university research.\nOn Wednesday, Georgia Tech announced a new NVIDIA-powered supercomputer that will help prepare undergraduate students to solve complex challenges with AI and HPC.\nAnd later this month, NVIDIA founder Chris Malachowsky will be inducted into the Hall of Fame for the University of Florida\u2019s Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, following the November inauguration of the university\u2019s $150 million Malachowsky Hall for Data Science & Information Technology.\nEducating Future Leaders for \u2018New Industrial Revolution\u2019\nNVIDIA has been investing in universities for decades, providing computing resources, advanced training curricula, donations and other support.\nThese contributions enable students and professors to access the high performance computing necessary for groundbreaking results at a key moment in the history of the industry.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of a new industrial revolution, and the reason why I say that is because an industrial revolution produces something new that was impossible to produce in the past,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cAnd in this new world, you can apply electricity, and what\u2019s going to come out of it is a whole bunch of floating-point numbers. We call them tokens, and those tokens are essentially artificial intelligence,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cAnd so this industrial revolution is going to be manufacturing intelligence at a very large scale,\u201d Huang said.\nOSU Breaks Ground on $213 Million Research Complex\nFriday\u2019s event in Oregon highlighted the Huangs\u2019 commitment to education and reflected the couple\u2019s deep personal ties to Oregon State, where the two met.\nThe conversation with Murthy followed the groundbreaking for the Jen-Hsun Huang and Lori Mills Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex, which took place Friday morning on the Corvallis campus.\nWhen it opens in 2026, the 150,000-square-foot, $213 million complex \u2014 supported by a $50 million gift from the Huangs \u2014 will increase Oregon State\u2019s support for the semiconductor and technology industry in Oregon and beyond.\nHarnessing one of the nation\u2019s most powerful NVIDIA supercomputers, the complex will bring together faculty and students to solve critical challenges facing the world in areas such as climate science, clean energy and water resources.\nHuang sees the center \u2014 and AI \u2014 as helping put the benefits of computing at the service of people doing work across a broad range of disciplines.\nOregon State is one of the world\u2019s premier schools in forestry, Huang said, adding that \u201clet\u2019s just face it, it\u2019s very unlikely that somebody who was in forestry, it\u2019s not impossible, but C++ is probably not your thing,\u201d Huang said.\nThanks to ChatGPT, you can \u201cnow use a computer to apply it to your field of science and apply this computing technology to revolutionize your work.\u201d\nThat makes learning how to think \u2014 and how to collaborate \u2014 more important than ever, Huang said. It\u2019s \u201cno different than if I gave you a partner to collaborate with you to solve problems,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cYou still need to know how to collaborate, how to prompt, how to frame a problem, how to refine the solution, how to iterate on it and how to change your mind.\u201d\nNVIDIA Joins $110 Million Partnership to Help Universities Teach AI Skills\nThe groundbreaking at Oregon State is just one of several announcements highlighting NVIDIA\u2019s global commitment to advancing the global technology industry.\nLast week, the Biden Administration announced a new $110 million AI partnership between Japan and the United States, including an initiative to fund research through collaboration between the University of Washington and the University of Tsukuba.\nAs part of this, NVIDIA is committing $25 million to a collaboration with Amazon to bring the latest technologies to the University of Washington, in Seattle, and the University of Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo.\nGeorgia Tech Unveils New AI Makerspace in Collaboration With NVIDIA\nAnd on Wednesday, Georgia Tech\u2019s College of Engineering established an AI supercomputing hub dedicated to teaching students.\nThe AI Makerspace was launched in collaboration with NVIDIA. College leaders call it a \u201cdigital sandbox\u201d for students to understand and use AI. Initially focusing on undergraduates, the AI Makerspace aims to democratize access to computing resources typically reserved for researchers or technology companies.\nStudents will access the cluster online as part of their coursework. The Makerspace will also better position students after graduation as they work with AI professionals and help shape future applications.\n\u2018Beginning of a New World\u2019\nTo be sure, AI has limits, Huang explained. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than when you work with teammates or lab partners; you\u2019re guiding each other along because you know each other\u2019s weaknesses and strengths,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Huang said now is a fantastic time to get an education and prepare for a career.\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a new world and this is the best of times to go to school \u2014 the whole world is changing, right? New technology and new capabilities, new instruments and new ways to learn,\u201d Huang said.\nImages courtesy of Oregon State University.\n\n\nCategories: CorporateTags: Artificial Intelligence | Education | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Even as a 2D image, the scene would be beautiful and inviting. Now imagine exploring that same view in 3D \u2013 without needing to be there.\nNVIDIA RTX technology-powered AI helps turn such an imagination into reality. Using Instant NeRF, creatives are transforming collections of still images into digital 3D scenes in just seconds.\nSimply Radiant\nA NeRF, or neural radiance field, is an AI model that takes 2D images representing a scene as input and interpolates between them to render a complete 3D scene. The model operates as a neural network \u2014 a model that replicates how the brain is organized and is often used for tasks that require pattern recognition.\nUsing spatial location and volumetric rendering, a NeRF uses the camera pose from the images to render a 3D iteration of the scene. Traditionally, these models are computationally intensive, requiring large amounts of rendering power and time.\nA recent NVIDIA AI research project changed that.\nInstant NeRF takes NeRFs to the next level, using AI-accelerated inverse rendering to approximate how light behaves in the real world. It enables researchers to construct a 3D scene from 2D images taken at different angles. Scenes can now be generated in seconds, and the longer the NeRF model is trained, the more detailed the resulting 3D renders.\nNVIDIA researchers released four neural graphics primitives, or pretrained datasets, as part of the Instant-NGP training toolset at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference in 2022. The tools let anyone create NeRFs with their own data. The researchers won a best paper award for the work, and TIME Magazine named Instant NeRF a best invention of 2022.\nIn addition to speeding rendering for NeRFs, Instant NeRF makes the entire image reconstruction process accessible using NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX desktop and laptop GPUs. While the time it takes to render a scene depends on factors like dataset size and the mix of image and video source content, the AI training doesn\u2019t require server-grade or cloud-based hardware.\nNVIDIA RTX workstations and GeForce RTX PCs are ideally suited to meet the computational demands of rendering NeRFs. NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs feature Tensor Cores, dedicated AI hardware accelerators that provide the horsepower to run generative AI locally.\nReady, Set, Go\nGet started with Instant NeRF to learn about radiance fields and experience imagery in a new way.\nDevelopers and tech enthusiasts can download the source-code base to compile. Nontechnical users can download the Windows installers for Instant-NGP software, available on GitHub.\nWhile the installer is available for a wide range of RTX GPUs, the program performs best on the latest-architecture GeForce RTX 40 Series and NVIDIA RTX Ada Generation GPUs.\n\nThe \u201cGetting Started With Instant NeRF\u201d guide walks users through the process, including loading one of the primitives, such as \u201cNeRF Fox,\u201d to get a sense of what\u2019s possible. Detailed instructions and video walkthroughs \u2014 like the one above \u2014 demonstrate how to create NeRFs with custom data, including tips for capturing good input imagery and compiling codebases (if built from source). The guide also covers using the Instant NeRF graphical user interface, optimizing scene parameters and creating an animation from the scene.\nThe NeRF community also offers many tips and tricks to help users get started. For example, check out the livestream below and this technical blog post.\n\nShow and Tell\nDigital artists are composing beautiful scenes and telling fresh stories with NVIDIA Instant NeRF. The Instant NeRF gallery showcases some of the most innovative and thought-provoking examples, viewable as video clips in any web browser.\nHere are a few:\n\n\u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d by Karen X. Cheng and James Perlman A pianist practices her song, part of her daily routine, though there\u2019s nothing mundane about what happens next. The viewer peers into the mirror, a virtual world that can be observed but not traversed; it\u2019s unreachable by normal means. Then, crossing the threshold, it\u2019s revealed that this mirror is in fact a window into an inverted reality that can be explored from within. Which one is real?\n\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-karenx-v9-1280x680-1.mp4\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMeditation\u201d by Franc Lucent As soon as they walked into one of many rooms in Nico Santucci\u2019s estate, Lucent knew they needed to turn it into a NeRF. Playing with the dynamic range and reflections in the pond, it presented the artist with an unknown exploration. They were pleased with the softness of the light and the way the NeRF elevates the room into what looks like something out of a dream \u2014 the perfect place to meditate. A NeRF can freeze a moment in a way that\u2019s more immersive than a photo or video.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-franc-lucent-meditation-1280x680-1.mp4\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cZeus\u201d by Hugues Bruy\u00e8re These rendered 3D scenes with Instant NeRF use the data Bruy\u00e8re previously captured for traditional photogrammetry using mirrorless digital cameras, smartphones, 360-degree cameras and drones. Instant NeRF gives him a powerful tool to help preserve and share cultural artifacts through online libraries, museums, virtual-reality experiences and heritage-conservation projects. This NeRF was trained using a dataset of photos taken with an iPhone at the Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/studio-ai-decoded-hugues-zeus-1280x680-1.mp4\n\u00a0\nFrom Image to Video to Reality\nTransforming images into a 3D scene with AI is cool. Stepping into that 3D creation is next level.\nThanks to a recent Instant NeRF update, users can render their scenes from static images and virtually step inside the environments, moving freely within the 3D space. In virtual-reality (VR) environments, users can feel complete immersion into new worlds, all within their headsets.\nThe potential benefits are nearly endless.\nFor example, a realtor can create and share a 3D model of a property, offering virtual tours at new levels. Retailers can showcase products in an online shop, powered by a collection of images and AI running on RTX GPUs.

Since 2021, GeForce RTX gamers have been able to accelerate their EVERSPACE 2 frame rates in both the Steam and Game Pass versions of the game using DLSS 2. Now, the new EVERSPACE 2 Incursions update has docked, upgrading the game to Unreal Engine 5, introducing improved Lumen Global Illumination lighting, and adding a ton of new gameplay features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the Incursions update, DLSS has been upgraded, adding support for DLSS 3 Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex. Performance is now even faster on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, desktops and laptops, and gameplay responsiveness is boosted for all GeForce gamers, further enhancing EVERSPACE 2\u2019s action.\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, frame rates are multiplied by 2X on average at 4K, with every setting maxed out, enabling gameplay at over 100 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4070, and performance up to 200 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440 and 1920x1080, performance is increased by 1.7X on average, enabling every GeForce RTX 40 Series gamer to play at over 100 FPS, and up to 300 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make gameplay even more responsive, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency by up to 52% in EVERSPACE 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGray Zone Warfare Available Now With DLSS 3 & Reflex: Boost Performance By Up To 2.7X\nMADFINGER Games' Gray Zone Warfare is an immersive tactical FPS with a maximum focus on realism, and was one of Steam\u2019s top 10 most wishlisted games before its release today. Following a mysterious event that took place on an island in Southeast Asia, the entire area has been put under international quarantine. With almost all the civilian population evacuated by the United Nations, three PMCs are tasked by their enigmatic clients to explore the region, uncover its secrets, and bring back anything of value.\nJoin one of the PMCs and navigate a vast open setting alone or in a squad. Adapt to your surroundings, use tactics to your advantage, and fight against other human operators and AI-controlled enemies in a persistent world that keeps on living even when you're not playing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable now, Gray Zone Warfare utilizes the latest technologies to deliver an enhanced experience for GeForce RTX users. With DLSS 3 Frame Generation, frame rates are multiplied by an average of 2.7X at 4K using the Epic graphics preset. This massive performance boost enables owners of the GeForce RTX 4070 and up to play at well over 60 FPS, with frame rates climbing to 140 on the world\u2019s fastest gaming GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, a 2.1X performance multiplier enables Epic-quality gameplay at 90 FPS and above on an array of GPUs. And at 1920x1080, DLSS 3 Frame Generation gives all Gray Zone Warfare GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers the performance to play at Epic at over 60 FPS, with performance surpassing 140 on the GeForce RTX 4070 and up, for the definitive experience at the most popular resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, all GeForce gamers can enable NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency by up to 54% for an even more responsive experience, and hardware-accelerated, ray-traced Unreal Engine 5 Lumen lighting ensures the Epic preset takes the game's graphics a step higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA RTX Remix Open Beta Upgrades To DLSS 3.5 With Ray Reconstruction\nNVIDIA RTX Remix enables modders to reimagine classic games with full ray tracing, and to update models and textures with modern rendering features that work hand in hand with ray-traced effects to deliver the level of graphical fidelity seen in Portal with RTX, our ray-traced reimagining of Valve\u2019s classic game.\nLast month, we updated Portal with RTX to add support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction technology. This advanced AI-powered neural renderer improves upon previously available rendering techniques to improve the fidelity, responsiveness and quality of ray-traced effects, giving all GeForce RTX gamers an even better experience.\nNow, DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction has been added to the publicly available NVIDIA RTX Remix beta. With just a few clicks, RTX Remix mods can be updated to DLSS 3.5, enhancing ray tracing as in Portal with RTX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons captured in Half-Life 2 RTX: An RTX Remix Project, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and Deus Ex. Learn more about each mod in our new RTX Remix article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotoGP\u212224 Available May 2nd With DLSS 2\nEmbark on your quest to become a MotoGP\u2122 legend and shape your own epic saga in Milestone\u2019s MotoGP\u212224, launching May 2nd.

Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest in Steam\u2019s most wishlisted game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Manor Lords launches into Early Access on April 26th, GeForce RTX gamers can instantly increase frame rates thanks to day-one support for DLSS 2. At 4K, a 47% average boost to performance enables owners of the GeForce RTX 4070, and faster cards, to exceed 60 FPS, and enables owners of faster GPUs to increase performance.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440 and 1920x1080, DLSS 2 allows all GeForce RTX 40 Series owners to comfortably surpass 60 FPS with max settings, enabling you to watch over your bustling settlement with the highest possible frame rates, and zoom in to battles, issuing orders in real-time without slowdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For No Rest for the Wicked\nNo Rest for the Wicked, from Moon Studios, the award-winning developers of Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps, is a visceral, precision action RPG launching into early access on April 18th.\nThe year is 841 and King Harol is dead. As word of his death echoes throughout the kingdom, the crown passes to his arrogant, yet untested son Magnus. Even worse, the Pestilence, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned.\nYou are a Cerim, a member of a group of mystical holy warriors imbued with remarkable powers and sworn to defeat the Pestilence at any cost. But the task will prove increasingly challenging as you become entangled in the people\u2019s plight and the vast political struggle of this downtrodden land. Chaos will pull you in every direction as you seek to cleanse the land of wickedness and shape the kingdom\u2019s fate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor optimized performance in No Rest for the Wicked and every other game, download and install our new Game Ready Driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nLearn more about GeForce Game Ready Drivers here, and download the new GeForce Game Ready 552.22 WHQL driver through GeForce Experience, the NVIDIA app beta, or from GeForce.com.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on the GeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can best assist you.

It supports all popular Kubernetes variants and integrates with third-party AI tools and frameworks.\nRun:ai customers include some of the world\u2019s largest enterprises across multiple industries, which use the Run:ai platform to manage data-center-scale GPU clusters.\n\u201cRun:ai has been a close collaborator with NVIDIA since 2020 and we share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure,\u201d said Omri Geller, Run:ai cofounder and CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to join NVIDIA and look forward to continuing our journey together.\u201d\nThe Run:ai platform provides AI developers and their teams:\n\nA centralized interface to manage shared compute infrastructure, enabling easier and faster access for complex AI workloads.\nFunctionality to add users, curate them under teams, provide access to cluster resources, control over quotas, priorities and pools, and monitor and report on resource use.\nThe ability to pool GPUs and share computing power \u2014 from fractions of GPUs to multiple GPUs or multiple nodes of GPUs running on different clusters \u2014 for separate tasks.\nEfficient GPU cluster resource utilization, enabling customers to gain more from their compute investments.\n\nNVIDIA will continue to offer Run:ai\u2019s products under the same business model for the immediate future. And NVIDIA will continue to invest in the Run:ai product roadmap, including enabling on NVIDIA DGX Cloud, an AI platform co-engineered with leading clouds for enterprise developers, offering an integrated, full-stack service optimized for generative AI.\nNVIDIA HGX, DGX and DGX Cloud customers will gain access to Run:ai\u2019s capabilities for their AI workloads, particularly for large language model deployments. Run:ai\u2019s solutions are already integrated with NVIDIA DGX, NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, NVIDIA Base Command, NGC containers, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, among other products.\nNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform and Run:ai\u2019s platform will continue to support a broad ecosystem of third-party solutions, giving customers choice and flexibility.\nTogether with Run:ai, NVIDIA will enable customers to have a single fabric that accesses GPU solutions anywhere. Customers can expect to benefit from better GPU utilization, improved management of GPU infrastructure and greater flexibility from the open architecture.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: DGX Cloud \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These EMAs include the 8-day, 13-day, and 21-day EMAs, which provide insights into market movements and potential trade entry and exit points.\nUnlike simple moving averages, EMAs prioritize recent price data, making them more responsive to current market conditions, especially in volatile markets. This responsiveness is particularly advantageous for short-term trading strategies.\nIn practice, this strategy generates buy and sell signals based on the positioning and crossing of these EMAs. Traders can make informed trade decisions by identifying trends and potential price reversals.\nHow to set up the 8/21 EMA strategy on the NVDA chart?\nMany novice traders often fall into the trap of believing that complexity equates to effectiveness in trading strategies.\u00a0\nHowever, simplicity often yields better results. By adhering to a straightforward, rule-based entry approach, traders can avoid the pitfalls of overanalysis when interpreting charts.\u00a0\nThis strategy identifies bullish signals when the 8-day Exponential Moving Average crosses above both the 13-day and 21-day EMAs.\u00a0\nApproaching 8,13,21 EMA strategy entry point on Nvidia stock price chart.

The new price target represents a potential upside of nearly 38% over the next 12 months, compared to the current price\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n44 mins ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

Source: Finbold\nCurrently, the stock is experiencing a significant decrease of -10.15% from its highest point. As of press time, Nvidia\u2019s shares are priced at $853.54, reflecting a daily loss of -1.35%.\u00a0\nHowever, perhaps more concerning is the recent trend, with a decrease of -5.02% over the past five days.\u00a0\nAlthough the past month has seen a more modest decline of -0.97%, the recent performance suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment or market dynamics.\nNVDA\u2019s challenges\nNvidia faces several challenges that could potentially lead to a decline in its stock price. One major concern is the looming threat of diminishing dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware market.\u00a0\nHistorically, Nvidia has held a dominant position in supplying hardware and software for high-powered computing needs driven by the proliferation of AI applications.\u00a0\n\nHowever, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said to BNN Bloomberg:\u201cA lot of its big customers \u2026 are stocking up on its GPU products,\u201d Luria stated, pointing to Nvidia\u2019s biggest AI chip buyers, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). \u201cBut as they get to the capacity that they need to have, they\u2019re not going to keep buying this for years to come, which is what current Nvidia estimates imply.\u201d\n\nThis potential shift could result in reduced demand for Nvidia\u2019s products and lead to a significant cyclical downturn by 2026, according to Luria\u2019s analysis.\u00a0\nAs a result, D.A. Davidson expects Nvidia shares to potentially drop to $620 per share, representing a decline of nearly 30% from recent closing prices.\u00a0\nWhile Nvidia is not solely reliant on its AI chip business and has revenue streams from segments like autonomous driving technologies, the prospect of increased competition and reduced demand in its core market poses a significant challenge to the company\u2019s future growth prospects.\u00a0\nBuying opportunity or looming decline?\nHas Nvidia\u2019s stock price peaked? It\u2019s difficult to say. The recent downward trend and analyst predictions of a potential cyclical downturn raise concerns.\u00a0\nHowever, Nvidia\u2019s strong overall technical rating, dominance in data centers, and robust pipeline of new technologies suggest long-term potential.\u00a0\nFor short-term investors, waiting for a period of consolidation might be prudent. Long-term investors, however, may find the current price point an attractive entry opportunity despite the headwinds.\nBuy stocks now with eToro \u2013 trusted and advanced investment platform\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The market has substantial risks, from colossal losses to remarkable gains. Recently, one trader seemingly defied the odds.\nPer a post on X by stock market analyst Gurgavin Chandhoke on April 20, a trader transformed an $800 investment into a staggering $100,000 profit within mere hours by purchasing options in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).\nProfit from NVDA options. Source: Gurgavin Chadhoke\n\nHow did this investor profit from this NVDA options trade?\u00a0\nArmed with the belief that Nvidia\u2019s stock price was poised for a significant downturn, the trader acquired far-out-of-the-money put options with a strike price considerably lower than the current market value of Nvidia shares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Picks for you\n  \n\n\n\n                  Here\u2019s why Bitcoin\u2019s pullback is a buy signal and not a bear market warning\n              \n44 mins ago\n\n\n\n                  Economist says the real Trump trade is ditching U.S. stocks for foreign markets\n              \n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  How Dogecoin could trigger next market crash, according to commodity strategist\n              \n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n                  Legal expert warns Ripple v.

In turn, the put options value surged, with the stock price plummeting below the put options\u2019 strike price. On April 19, NVDA lost 10% of its value and fell from $846 on a previous close to $762.\u00a0\nNVDA stock price change in 24 hours. Source: Google Finance\n\nSwift action ensued as the trader exercised the options or sold them on the market, capitalizing on the price differential.\u00a0\nIn a matter of hours, what began as an $800 investment had ballooned into an astounding $100,000 windfall, underscoring the potential rewards \u2013 and risks \u2013 inherent in the world of options trading.\nUnderstanding the risks of options trading\nIf Nvidia\u2019s stock price rises following the trader\u2019s purchase of put options, the outcome would likely result in losses on the investment, as the increase in stock price would decrease the value of the put options. In essence, a rise in Nvidia\u2019s stock price would result in diminished value for the put options and potential losses for the trader.\nThis is crucial for investors to understand: When trading options, your profits might be high and swift, but so could the losses.\nBuy stocks now with eToro \u2013 trusted and advanced investment platform\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

However, generative AI isn\u2019t the only area of AI to be considered for investors. AI voice stocks are emerging as another growth area from which substantial returns could emerge.\nThat begs a question: what is the difference between generative AI and voice AI? AI voice refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to mimic natural human conversation and provide responses. Generative AI Is related to the creation of content, either text or images.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2024, investors have already seen that AI voice stocks are full of potential. Companies discussed below have moved higher as the technology has become more familiar to investors. The market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of nearly 24% between 2024 and 2032.\u00a0\nSoundHound AI (SOUN)\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is the hottest name in AI voice. The company exploded into prominence in mid-February when an Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) filing showed that the firm owned 1.7 million shares of SOUN stock.\u00a0\nThe stock can continue to grow due to multiple factors. The company\u2019s connection to Nvidia is undoubtedly one of the bigger reasons to consider investing. SoundHound AI delivers AI voice services in certain car applications that use Nvidia\u2019s Drive platform. Not only has Nvidia purchased a large stake of the company but it is also interfacing with SoundHound AI to create novel applications.\nThe other thing to note about SoundHound AI is that it is poised to dominate the AI voice restaurant sector. The company purchased SYNQ3 in November. SYNQ3 had 10,000 partnerships and 100,000 restaurants in its pipeline at that time. The acquisition consolidated SoundHound AI\u2019s already strong position in the conversational AI sector.\nLivePerson (LPSN)\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\nLivePerson (NASDAQ:LPSN) is another voice AI stock that engages in similar business to SoundHound AI. The company has sold its cloud-based services to Leading firms including HSBC (NYSE:HSBC), Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), and Virgin Media Group.\nLivePerson\u2019s business includes services ranging from messaging all the way to cloud-enabled conversational AI.\nHowever, the stock is not the clear winner that SoundHound AI is. LivePerson\u2019s revenues fell by 22% in Q4 2023 to $95.5 million. SoundHound AI, on the other hand, saw its revenues grow by 80%.\nThat said, there is still plenty to like about LPSN stock. The company signed 62 deals within the quarter. Further, the reason revenues declined is that the company is refocusing its efforts on conversational AI.\nIn order to better capture that opportunity the firm decided to discontinue on several unrelated business lines.\u00a0\nLivePerson continues to have a base of assets oriented toward conversational AI. It\u2019s also a relatively small company and the combination of those two factors means it could jump up quickly.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as a superstar firm on the merits of its generative AI capability. No one needs to be reminded of how that has fundamentally changed the value of its stock. Meanwhile, it\u2019s also clear that Nvidia sees substantial value in the AI voice sector as well.\nAs mentioned above, the company has made a substantial investment in SoundHound AI in an effort to capture some of that potential.

Each call represents 100 shares of the underlying stock, amounting to a total premium of $21 million for the trade.\nTraders bet on Nvidia stock. Source: Barchart\nThe $1,180 strike price represents about 32.63% upside from the current levels of about $889.64 per share.\nWhat do analysts predict for NVDA stock?\nThe continuous performance of Nvidia\u2019s stock prompts ongoing monitoring and adjustments of price targets for NVDA, with analysts closely considering daily developments and financial projections.\nAdding to the positive sentiment, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised the price target for NVDA stock to $1,100 on March 21, up from his previous target of $800. In a research note, Arcuri highlighted Nvidia\u2019s potential for significant new demand from global enterprises.\nOn March 20, Citigroup also increased its NVDA price target to $1,030. While Oppenheimer raised Nvidia\u2019s price target from $850 to $1,100 in a report issued on March 19.\nAnalysts\u2019 predictions seem to be a little off compared to trader\u2019s bet, which hopefully will be boosted by additional positive developments.\nPrevious Nvidia earnings report garnered over $200 billion worth of attention\nNvidia investors had nearly $200 billion in market value riding on the previous company earnings report, as indicated by options positioning.\nFortunately, the report exceeded expectations, driving NVDA stock up by 16.40%. This surge propelled it to reach the $800 threshold, a milestone it had not previously attained.\nPost-earnings surge of NVDA stock price.

One of the best explanations of the difference between $NVDA and $AMD and CUDA's \u00bbedge\u00ab. Worth the read:\n1. $AMD's GPUs usually lag behind $NVDA in peak floating point performance. The use-case for that is if you will be doing a lot of AI\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1vM9RtUlwK\n\u2014 Rihard Jarc (@RihardJarc) March 21, 2024\n\nIn an interview with NVIDIA's former researcher, it was revealed that despite best efforts from the competition, the CUDA platform has managed to retain its dominance in the markets, and it is NVIDIA's key weapon for substantial financial progress in the markets. The researchers say that the only difference between NVIDIA and others is CUDA, and this \"wall\" hasn't been breached yet. We have seen Intel merge up with several other firms to try and break CUDA's monopoly on AI and the same is happening at AMD who are placing bets on their ROCm software suite by making it more open-source. Even Jim Keller is going all-in against CUDA.\n\nThe researcher suggests that users on AMD's platform could leverage the company's HIPIFY set of tools. These tools are designed to convert CUDA code into portable HIP C++, which then makes that patch of code compatible with AMD's ROCm. Such code porting tools have seen immense popularity among those bridging the gap across multiple architectures, and another example is the emergence of ZLUDA, which does the same job as HIPIFY through translation layers. Still, the tool was later banned through a revised EULA by NVIDIA.\nThe NVIDIA researcher believes that clients looking to pursue AI must deem NVIDIA the best fit since investing in AMD means splashing more money into code porting tools, ultimately increasing the costs associated. However, with NVIDIA, you'll need to pour in a \"one-time\" investment that will grant you cutting-edge performance and all the necessary features available with the CUDA ecosystem. Companies such as Tiny Corp recommend NVIDIA AI systems over AMD for users as the platform \"Just Works\".\nWell, the opinions of NVIDIA's former researchers strengthen the ideology of NVIDIA's AI market dominance and how the company's AI products and its CUDA ecosystem have penetrated deep into the markets.\nNews Source: Richard Jarc\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s H20 AI Accelerators Are Reportedly Facing A Shortage In China, Amid The Massive Demand Prompted Due To DeepSeek\n\nMuhammad Zuhair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Vendor Reveal The Reason For Higher NVIDIA RTX 50 Series Costs; Says GPU & VRAM Combo Makes Up To 80% Of Total Cost\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s Free Line Offer Fails to Offset Customer Outrage Over Price Hikes As They Remain Adamant That The Carrier Misled Them\n\n\n\n137\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nTrump Media And Technology Group (DJT) Formally Asks Shareholders To Approve Its Reincorporation In Florida From Delaware And Authorize The Addition Of ~11 Million Shares To The Share Pool Limit By 2034\n\n\n\n136\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n59\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n58\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n42\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1372\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1148\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Last Friday, however, the chipmaker got swept up in a selloff of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, falling 10% in a single day, or about $212 billion in market capitalization. That\u2019s bigger than companies such as Adobe (ADBE), Walt Disney (DIS), and McDonald\u2019s (MCD).\nThis week, I\u2019m looking at some of the biggest one-day changes in market capitalization. I\u2019ll show how the stocks performed going forward and if it would have been better to buy the stock or just buy the general market.\nMega Caps Making Mega Moves\nThe table below shows the performance of stocks after huge losses in market capitalization like NVDA just experienced. I went back to 2000 and only considered stocks still trading, and looked for those that lost at least $50 billion in a single day. Since Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) move $50 billion on a 2% change in the stock price, I added the criteria that the stock had to lose at least 10%.\nStocks shedding huge value in a single day tended to perform well going forward, especially three and six months later. On average, it was better to buy the stock after these huge declines than to buy the S&P 500 Index (SPX). The average return for the stocks was better than the SPX at every timeframe I looked at, from one week to one year later. \nThe last row of the table (% Beat SPX) is the percentage of time you would have been better off buying the stock compared to the SPX. Roughly 54% of the time, the stock beat the index three months later, but six and 12 months later, the stock beat it less than half the time (42% and 46%, respectively).\n\nHere\u2019s the performance if you had bought the SPX instead of buying the stock. Over the next three months, instead of gaining 13% on average, you would have gained 6.25%.\n\nNext, I summarized stock returns after they gained at least $50 billion in market capitalization on a 10% move or more. For stocks making huge single-day gains, it has been better to wait a week before purchasing the stock. But after that, it\u2019s been better to own the stock than the SPX.\n On average, the stock lost 1% over the first week after the huge gain, but then gained 10.6% on average six months after the huge move higher. A year after the increase in market cap, the stock averaged a return of 14.7% vs. 8.6% for the S&P 500. Although the average return is better, the stock beat the SPX less than half the time (48%) 12 months later.\nComparing stock returns after a huge loss in market cap to a huge gain, in the short term especially, it has historically been a better choice to buy the stock after a big decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

(NVDA) had its worst week since March 2020, wiping out more than $200 billion in market value in a session after plunging 10%. What is happening to Tech stocks? More importantly, is it time to take profit on NVDA?        What is happening?Tech stocks have been on a downward spiral with the Magnificent Seven shed a combined total of $950 billion in market value last Friday, the largest on record. US stocks have since extended their recovery with\u00a0NVDA shares trading higher by 3.68% at $824.48 on Tuesday.While the stocks seem to be rebounding after the Friday sell-off, swings in the prices of AI stocks continue to be uncertain. Earnings from\u00a0ASML Holdings (ASML) and\u00a0Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.\u00a0(TSMC) have put pressure on the semiconductor sector as they reflect trends and challenges across the broader chip industry. TSMC, a key supplier to both Nvidia and Apple, recently adjusted its growth projection for non-memory chip markets to 10%, down from more than 10%, citing potential fall in demand for consumer electronics.For Nvidia to return to its recent peak and explore new levels, it will likely need signs from the major tech companies such as Microsoft, and Alphabet when they release Q1 earnings over the next few days. A disappointing earnings report from Meta, together with the worrying costs of AI saw its stock price taking a hit and leaving investors on edge on Wednesday. These companies are among the biggest buyers of Nvidia\u2019s chips, but they are also developing their in-house alternatives. This creates a challenge since Nvidia requires the tech giants to maintain their investment in AI data centres that uses its chips.What can you do?  Investors who have a long-term stake in Nvidia and believe in upside potential of the stock, even in a downward market trend for tech stocks, may consider selling call options on Nvidia. This strategy allows investors to earn premiums from the call options, which generates extra income while awaiting a\u00a0rise\u00a0in Nvidia's\u00a0share\u00a0price\u00a0to their desired target.Steps:With Nvidia\u2019s stock price at $796.77 on 25 April 2024, sell a call option with a $980 strike price (if you are comfortable selling your Nvidia shares at $980) for 1-month expiry (29 days). You will receive a total premium of $1,080,00 ($10.80 x 100 shares).This gives an annualized yield of 16.8% (10.80/796.77) x (360/29).If Nvidia\u2019s price falls below $980\u00a0(strike price of the call option)\u00a0at expiry, the option may expire worthless, and the investor retains the premium.If Nvidia\u2019s price rises above the strike price of $980, the investor is obligated to sell the share at $980, but the investor still\u00a0retains\u00a0the\u00a0option\u00a0premium.\u00a0When comparing to options with longer maturity, you can observe how this alters the premium you receive and the distance over which you will be able to set the strike.If the investor wishes to receive more premium, the investor can go for an option with a farther expiry. For the same strike at $980, the premium increases to $12.75 as the duration increases to\u00a036 days on 31 May 2024 (annualized yield = 16.0%).If the investor is only willing to sell the stock at a higher price but still want to receive same amount of premium, the investor has to choose the option with a farther expiry. For a similar premium of $10.85, you can sell the option with the strike at $1,050 and expiry in 57 days on 21\u00a0June 2024 (annualized yield = 8.6%).The table below shows how the premium yield changes as we adjust the strike price and expiry date. The premium yield is subject to many factors including how close the strike is to the current price as well as market moving events surrounding Nvidia.\u00a0Annualised yield of Nvidia options with different Strike and Expiry        Advantages of covered callsGenerates passive income.\u00a0Selling a covered call generates an income via premiums that can supplement the overall return of a portfolio.Relatively low risk.\u00a0As the risk of being short a call is covered with your stock position, this is a relatively low risk way to trade options.No extra margin required to sell covered calls.\u00a0As you hold the underlying stock for delivery, there is no extra margin required to sell the same number of covered calls at Saxo.Risks of trading covered callsCapping your stock\u2019s upside potential.\u00a0One key risk is the loss of opportunity to profit from your stock\u2019s potential upside above the call option\u2019s strike price.Risk of using covered calls as a proxy for take profit orders: In the example above, it is possible that the stock trades well above $980 through the course of the option but on expiry falls back below $980. Without the option, the investor might have booked the profit at $980 but because the stock was covered by call options, the investor might have waited out until expiry.Options are complex, high-risk products and require knowledge, investment experience and, in many applications, high risk acceptance. We recommend that before you invest in options, you inform yourself well about the operation and risks.

A quick scroll through X (formerly Twitter) shows many users reposting the article.\nEventually, a lack of additional reports of the alleged deal resulted in readers deducing that the news story was a prank for April Fool\u2019s Day. But that didn\u2019t stop its momentum and spread.\nWhat Spread the Nvidia Buys Xbox Prank?\nOne thing that didn\u2019t help was the time that the article was published. It went up on March 31. That was still early enough before April 1 that it managed to pull the wool over some readers\u2019 eyes.\nThis is another stark reminder that readers need to be careful about what they believe when April 1 rolls around. While there\u2019s plenty of legitimate news coming out today, there are also those pranking readers on April Fool\u2019s Day.\nWith all of that said, we offer all of the most recent stock market stories traders need to know about on Monday. And none of it is a prank!\nOur coverage goes over the biggest stock market news moving shares today. That includes everything happening with Li Auto\u00a0(NASDAQ:LI), Nio\u00a0(NYSE:NIO) and Bloom Energy\u00a0(NYSE:BE) stock today.

As robots become smarter and more capable, the demand for robotics solutions will continue to soar.\u00a0\nWhile the future is always uncertain, the potential of the robotics industry is undeniable. From self-driving cars to advanced surgical systems, the world is rapidly embracing robotics innovation. Investors eyeing long-term growth opportunities continue to closely monitor these companies, recognizing their potential to deliver outsized returns over the next decade.\u00a0\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top robotics stocks on pace to triple by 2030!\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at the forefront of the robotics revolution. The company\u2019s graphic processing units (GPUs) are the powerhouse behind many advanced AI and machine learning applications.\nNvidia is heavily invested in developing software platforms and tools specifically for robotics applications. Its robotics platform, Nvidia Isaac, provides developers with a comprehensive suite to build and simulate robots. That helps speed up the lead time and deployment of robotics applications, which can be extremely robust depending upon the scale. With robots needing to process vast amounts of data to perceive and interact with their environment, Nvidia\u2019s AI GPUs are an essential component of this process. Nvidia Isaac also provides a full spectrum for optimizing advancements in AI specifically tailored to robotics learning. This powerful combination of hardware and software positions Nvidia as a major beneficiary of the robotics boom.\nIntuitive Surgical (IRSG)\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a contender for the best robotics stocks on pace to triple by 2030. The company is a leader in the field of robotics surgery, and its da Vinci surgical system holds a dominant market share.\nIntuitive Surgical\u2019s success lies in its da Vinci surgical system, an innovative platform revolutionizing minimally invasive surgery. The system enables surgeons to perform complex procedures with enhanced precision and control, leading to better patient outcomes. With a minor hiccup in 2020, the company has executed well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth over the last decade. In its latest quarterly financial results, revenue increased 11% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.7 billion. Net income increased to $545 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, with da Vinci surgical installs hitting a record 8,887 as of March 31, 2024. With the recent approval of its next-generation da Vinci 5 system by the FDA, the future remains extremely bright.\nUiPath (PATH)\nSource: dennizn/Shutterstock.com\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a market leader in robotics process automation (RPA) software. Its platform provides a user-friendly way to create and deploy software robots that can mimic human actions.\u00a0\nUiPath\u2019s platform has garnered widespread acclimation, attracting a diverse range of clients across various industries. The company\u2019s solutions cater to both large enterprises and smaller businesses, helping to ensure broad market appeal. Additionally, the market is still in its infancy stages and Grand View Research estimates the market will grow at a 40% CAGR from 2023 to 2030. The potential for UiPath to transform the way work gets done is enormous. The company also just hit a very important milestone, achieving its first profitable quarter as a public company in Q4 FY24. As automation becomes indispensable in the business world, UiPath remains one of the top robotics stocks to snap up in 2024 while it\u2019s still cheap.\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He put in $12,000 at the time and then another $50,000 in 2022. His total stake is now worth $3 million.\u00a0\u00a0\nHis fortune, which remains mostly invested and untouched, was a matter of research and good timing, he said.\n\"They were the original creators of the GPUs,\" he said. \"I'm not even much of a techie. I'm not a computer person at all, but I knew that the GPUs would be worth something one day.\"\n\n\nNvidia went from a gaming icon to an AI superpower seemingly overnight. In the early days of the pandemic, its stock climbed as gamers, with time on their hands under COVID-19 lockdowns, scrambled to upgrade their computer rigs with the latest Nvidia GPUs.\nThen, in November 2022, the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT fueled a run of stunning growth for Nvidia as its GPUs were the only game in town when it came to powering such AI programs. The stock has essentially gone parabolic since.\u00a0\nAccording to Vanda Research, Nvidia has become the top stock among retail investors, surpassing retail portfolio concentrations of Apple, Tesla, and SPY, the most popular S&P 500 exchange-traded fund.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTom said his Nvidia stake was worth about three times what he had in his 401(k) and that he felt more comfortable that he'd be able to live well in retirement, a concern that loomed over him before he went in on Nvidia.\nGenerational wealth\nKiana Danial is the 40-year-old founder of Invest Diva, a company that helps women take control of their financial future and create generational wealth.\nDanial hadn't heard of Nvidia before 2015, when she married her husband, who was a gamer in his free time. Danial said she liked to invest in products she uses, but when she heard her husband talk about how much he loved Nvidia, she decided to buy the stock.\n\n\nShe first bought Nvidia in June 2016. She purchased 10 shares and shortly after continued setting new buy orders every month.\u00a0\n\"The investments started growing pretty rapidly,\" Danial said.\nNvidia shares tumbled by more than 30% in 2018. During that time, Danial continued adding to her positions and started adding Nvidia to her Roth IRA and a Roth IRA she set up for her daughter.\u00a0\n\n\nDanial sold the bulk of her shares in February and March 2023 to help partially cover a large down payment on a second home.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                The pool in Kiana Danial's home. Her Nvidia investments helped fund a down payment.\n                                \n                        \n                        \n                        Jeff Roberts Photography\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\nDanial sold 800 shares over a six-week period for about $188,795, bringing her total number of shares down to 323.\u00a0\n\"I'm obviously kicking myself,\" Danial said about selling the stock. \"But we bought our dream house and it's beautiful.\"\n\n\nThe stock she still owns has left her with $202,940 in gains. She doesn't plan on selling her shares anytime soon and intends to buy more.\nDanial's daughter recently turned 6, and the account Danial set up for her has grown 568% and is worth around $11,000.\nThe investors Business Insider spoke with piled into Nvidia early on because of its renown among PC gamers, but today, the company's chips are the lynchpin of the AI revolution \u2014 and there is virtually zero competition.\n\n\nThe company's dominance has made it hard to find anyone willing to give the bear case, though some analysts have recently sounded more hesitant about further gains after the stock's meteoric rally.\u00a0\nNew financial security\u00a0\nRick, a 36-year-old retail investor in Texas, started buying Nvidia in 2009. The stock caught his eye because, at the time, the company seemed like the future of gaming. He invested $600, which he described as a wild-card bet.\u00a0\n\"And so $600 turned into $140K,\" Rick said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWith Nvidia, Rick said he felt he had a safety net to fall back on. He's spent only a small portion of his gains so far: $15,000 to flip a car he worked on, a hobby he said he wouldn't have gotten into without the Nvidia money. For his 10th anniversary, he and his wife packed their bags for a $14,000 getaway in Costa Rica.\n\"I had zero stress about it. It was like, 'We can spend as much as we want on this trip,'\" he said.\nThat sense of security that such a windfall provides was the top theme among the Nvidia investors BI connected with.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's a similar story for Chris Downs, a 66-year-old who lives in rural Missouri and retired from his job as a math teacher three years ago.\nHe's been investing for a while, but his interest in Nvidia began when he bought a new computer for video editing at the start of the COVID-19 quarantines. Downs said he splurged on an Nvidia graphics card for his setup and was impressed.\u00a0\nHe bought 112 shares in March 2020 for $79 each.\u00a0\n\n\nIn July 2023, he sold 28 shares of Nvidia at $436 apiece to offset losses from other investments. Now he has 84 shares left, worth over $65,000 based on Monday's prices, in addition to other stocks.\u00a0\nHe said he would probably sell some of his Nvidia shares closer to the election, but he's planning to invest the proceeds for his four children, as his parents and grandparents had done for their kids.\nDowns said his lifestyle wasn't lavish but that he tried to travel every month. Places he's been to include Bolivia, Paris, and Mexico City, and he plans to go to Spain at the end of April.\n\n\nHe said security was the biggest perk of his investment, as well as knowing that he could cover unpredictable financial mishaps.\u00a0\n\"It's nice in retirement not to have to worry,\" Downs said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

DLSS 3 gives us the performance headroom to bring our vision to life and to support additional ray tracing features, helping gamers fully immerse themselves in the adventures of Kay Vess and Nix.\"\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture used in GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high-quality frames, rather than just pixels. Through a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7 out of every 8 of the displayed pixels, multiplying performance even in CPU-bound scenarios.\nAdditionally, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency in Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws. System latency affects the time it takes for actions to occur in-game - the lower your latency, the more responsive a game becomes, and the better the gameplay feels. Available in over 100 games, Reflex is used by over 50 million users each month, and with there being no downsides to the tech whatsoever, it's a must-have for gamers wanting the most responsive experience possible.\nStar Wars\u2122 Outlaws is built using Massive Entertainment's incredible Snowdrop Engine, enabling the developers to create the most detailed Star Wars experience you've ever seen, with perfectly recreated ships and iconic locations, and stunning worlds for you to visit and experience.\nAs part of the collaboration, Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws on PC is also being enhanced with NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) and ray-traced Global Illumination lighting, taking visuals to the next level. RTXDI figures out the most important light samples in Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws to cast physically accurate ray-traced shadows. Performance remains fast thanks to RTXDI's innovative design, and on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs ray tracing gets even faster thanks to each card's fourth generation, super fast Ray Tracing Cores.\"\nStar Wars\u2122 Outlaws will invite players to experience the Star Wars galaxy like never before through an original story set between Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2122 *and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\u2122. \u00a0*As the Galactic Empire relentlessly pursues the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance, the criminal underworld thrives. Fans will play as cunning scoundrel, Kay Vess and her loyal companion Nix, as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen. Seeking the means to start a new life, players will join Kay and Nix as they fight, steal, and outwit their way through the galaxy's crime syndicates and join the galaxy's most wanted.\nYou can pre-order Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws on the Ubisoft Store or play the Ultimate edition 3-days early with Ubisoft+.Twitter LogoFacebook LogoCopyLinkedIn LogoShare:More From Ubisoft15 October 20246 Min ReadJust Dance 2025 Edition & Just Dance VR: Welcome to Dancity Available NowCheck out the full Just Dance 2025 song list and find out more about dancing in VR with Meta Quest headsets.Read More13 May 20246 Min ReadHow to Play the Assassin\u2019s Creed Games In OrderWhether you\u2019re curious about how your favorite Assassin fits in or where to start unraveling the history-spanning storyline, here\u2019s a quick rundown of the series so far.Read More3 October 202410 Min ReadPrince of Persia 35th Anniversary - A Look Back at the Original GameSeries creator Jordan Mechner and others share stories from the creation of 1989's Prince of Persia and what it means to them.Read More5 August 20243 Min ReadStar Wars Outlaws\u2122 Post-Launch Roadmap Revealed\u202f Learn more about the open-world Star Wars game\u2019s Season Pass content, including two story packs, an exclusive mission, and cosmetic items.

The rival has dominated the AI computing space with its GPUs and recently unveiled plans to launch much more powerful follow-ups to the H100 and H200 later this year using its new Blackwell architecture.\nIntel said air-cooled and liquid-cooled versions of the Gaudi 3 accelerator card will start sampling with customers in the first and second quarters of this year, respectively. It then plans to launch the air-cooled version in the third quarter and the liquid-cooled version in the fourth quarter.\nAt launch, Gaudi 3 will be supported by Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro, which are expected to receive the chip by the second quarter. The chip will also be made available in the Intel Developer Cloud platform for testing and development.\nWhile Intel is targeting Nvidia\u2019s H100 that debuted in 2022 and the recently launched H200 with Gaudi 3, the company will have to contend with the fact that Nvidia could start rolling out much more powerful GPUs around the same time as Gaudi 3.\nThis is part of an accelerated road map Nvidia announced last fall to stay ahead of rivals, underlying one of the major challenges Intel faces in trying to gain market share. The chipmaker is also facing competition from AMD and cloud service providers designing their own AI chips, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, as well as a slew of startups.\nBut Intel executives emphasized that customers are looking for alternatives to Nvidia\u2019s powerful and popular chips and said they are building a comprehensive AI strategy with open, scalable systems that will be attractive for enterprises across all AI segments.\n\u201cWhen we talk to customers, they are clearly asking us for choice, for competitive price-per- performance, for time-to-value and for an open ecosystem for AI solutions and deployments,\u201d said Jeni Barovian, general manager of AI solutions strategy and product management within Intel\u2019s Data Center and AI Group, in a briefing with journalists and analysts.\n\u201cAnd so we have a commitment here at Intel in a number of different areas: to streamline the developer workflow for AI, to simplify AI infrastructure, to provide scalable systems and to accelerate AI workloads with our foundational silicon software and systems,\u201d she said.\nAs for Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell GPUs, Intel plans to measure the performance of the rival chips once they launch, but the company expects Gaudi 3 \u201cto be highly competitive\u201d due to its pricing as well as other considerations like the chipmaker\u2019s reliance on industry-standard Ethernet and Gaudi 3\u2019s open integrated network on chip, according to Intel\u2019s Das Kamhout.\n\u201cWe believe it's a strong offering that provides that level of choice at the right [total cost of ownership] and the power efficiency that our customers are demanding,\u201d said Kamhout, who is a vice president and senior principal engineer in the Data Center and AI Group.\nGaudi 3 Specs, Improvements Over Gaudi 2\nCompared with Gaudi 2, Gaudi 3 will provide double the AI compute performance using the 8-bit floating point (FP8) format and quadruple the performance using the 16-bit BFLOAT16 format, according to Intel. It will also offer two times greater network bandwidth and 1.5 times greater memory bandwidth, the company added.\nThere are a variety of factors that make these improvements possible while using the same underlying architecture as the predecessor chip.\nEitan Medina, COO of Intel\u2019s Habana Labs unit that designs the Gaudi chips, said Gaudi 3 is made up of two identical dies packaged together with eight high-bandwidth memory (HBM) banks. These dies are manufactured using a 5-nanometer manufacturing process in contrast with a 7nm process that has been used for Gaudi 2.\nEach of the two dies has four matrix math engines, 32 fifth-generation Tensor Processor Cores and 48 MB of SRAM, and they\u2019re connected using a \u201cvery high-bandwidth interface that from a software point of view, allows [Gaudi 3] to act as a single device,\u201d according to Medina.\nThis gives Gaudi 3 a total of eight matrix math engines, 64 Tensor Processor Cores and 96 MB of SRAM. The chip also has a total HBM capacity of 128 GB and memory bandwidth of 3.7 TBps. It comes with support for 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 connectivity as well.\nWhat helps make Gaudi 3 unique, according to Medina, is the fact that the chip integrates 24 200-Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) network interface ports. These ports take advantage of a technology called RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), which enables remote direct memory access over an Ethernet network. This, in turn, allows up to eight Gaudi 3 chips to communicate with each other within a single server as well as across multiple nodes.\n\u201cDepending on what your workload needs are for inference, fine-tuning or training, you [can] build clusters at any size. [You] form a single node with just eight accelerators. And using Ethernet, you can build racks and complete clusters with literally thousands of Gaudis. This is what our customers are doing today,\u201d Medina said.\nIntel plans to make Gaudi 3 available in two form factors: an accelerator card that is compliant with the Open Compute Project\u2019s Accelerator Module (OAM) design specification and a dual-slot, full-height PCIe add-in card that offers the same peak FP8 performance of 1,835 teraflops.\nThe PCIe version of Gaudi 3 will have a thermal design power of 600 watts while the OAM version will go up to 900 watts with air cooling and up to 1.2 kilowatts with liquid cooling..\nGaudi 3 Scales To 1,024-Node Clusters\nIntel has developed reference architectures for Gaudi 3 that start with a single node connecting eight chips and scale all the way to a 1,024-node cluster consisting of 8,192 chips.\nThese multi-node clusters are necessary for training large AI models faster and enabling lower latency and high throughput for the inferencing of such models.\nEnabled by the OAM-compliant universal baseboard developed by Intel, the single node can achieve 14.7 petaflops of FP8 compute performance, and it sports 1,024 GB of memory and 8.4 TBps of networking bandwidth, according to Intel. A 64-node cluster brings that up to 940 petaflops, 65.4 TB of memory and 76.8 TBps of networking bandwidth.\nScaling to 512 nodes in a cluster provides 7.5 exaflops, 524.3 TB of memory capacity and 614 TBps of networking bandwidth. Bringing that to 1,24 nodes enables 15 exaflops, 1 PB of memory capacity and 1.2 PBps of network bandwidth.\n\u201cUsing Ethernet as a standard interface and working across the ecosystem with our OEM partners, we literally are able to support customers building implementations of AI at any size,\u201d Medina said.\nGaudi 3 Comparisons To H100, H200\nCompared with Nvidia\u2019s H100, Gaudi 3 enables 70 percent faster training time for the 13-billion-parameter Llama 2 model, 50 percent faster for the 7-billion-parameter Llama 2 model and 40 percent faster for the 175-billion-parameter GPT-3 model, according to Intel.\nThe chipmaker also compared Gaudi 3 to Nvidia\u2019s H200, which significantly increases the HBM capacity to 141 GB from the H100\u2019s 80 GB, higher than Gaudi 3\u2019s 12-GB capacity.\nFor large language model inferencing, which Intel measured by tokens per second, it said Gaudi 3 is on par with the H200 for the 7B and 70B Llama models.\nFor the 180-billion-parameter Falcon model, however, while Gaudi 3 is on par with the H200 when it comes to 128-token output sequences, the chip gains an edge when those output sequences grow to 2,048 tokens. This translates into a 2.3-fold performance advantage when using 128 tokens as input and a 3.8-fold advantage when using 2,048 tokens as input.\nWhen it comes to power efficiency, Gaudi 3 also has its advantages, according to Intel.\nCompared with the H100, Gaudi 3 offers power efficiency that is on par or slightly worse when it comes to inferencing Llama and Falcon models with 128-token outputs, but the chip gains an advantage when those outputs are grown to 2,048 tokens. This advantage, measured by tokens per second per accelerator card per watt, translates into a 20 percent to 40 percent boost for 7B Llama, a 2.1-fold to 2.2-fold boost for 70B Llama, and a 90 percent to 2.3-fold increase for Falcon 180B.\n\u201cOur customers are telling us that what they really find limiting is actually their ability even to get power to the data center. Price-performance is important. But power-performance is also extremely important,\u201d Medina said.\nAll of these comparisons were made at single- or multi-node levels rather than using a single accelerator chip, and Intel said it made the comparisons using recently public data from Nvidia.\nGaudi 3 Supported By \u2018End-To-End AI Software Stack\u2019\nWhile offering competitive performance and efficiency are table stakes in the fight against Nvidia, Intel knows that software enablement is equally important to compete.\nThat\u2019s why the company said it has developed an \u201cend-to-end AI software stack\u201d that includes everything from the firmware, libraries and drivers to the models, frameworks and tools needed to develop AI applications that run on Intel\u2019s Gaudi chips.\nGaudi chips support a wide range of models, which includes Llama, Stable Diffusion, BERT, Mixtral, GPT-2, CodeLlama and Falcon. It also supports frameworks like PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning as well as libraries like Hugging Face and MosaicML. Supported orchestration platforms include Kubernetes, Red Hat and OpenShift. Machine learning tools supported by Gaudi chips include the company\u2019s own cnvrg.io as well as TensorBoard and Ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Versus Iran \u2014 What All-Out War Could Look Like Texas Warns of Possible Power Emergency Next Week Iran\u2019s Missile Barrage Was an Error Israel Can Gain From Israel Grapples With New Phase in its Multi-Front War With Iran A $150 Billion Fortune Bolsters Qatari Royals at Critical Moment   The updated processor, called Gaudi 3, will be widely available in the third quarter, Intel said at a company event Tuesday. The chip is designed to boost performance in two key areas: helping train AI systems \u2014 a process that involves bombarding them with data \u2014 and running the finished software. Booming demand for AI services has sent tech companies scrambling for these so-called accelerator chips, but Nvidia has seen most of the benefit. Earlier versions of Gaudi failed to achieve the market share gains that Intel had been hoping for, Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has said. He expects the new model to have a bigger impact. \u201cThey\u2019re a good competitor, but people want an alternative,\u201d he said Tuesday of Nvidia. \u201cThe world needs more suppliers, and we\u2019re quite dedicated to providing that choice.\u201d Intel shares gained were up less than 1% at $38 as of 1:33 p.m. in New York on Tuesday, reversing an earlier decline. They had been down 24% this year through Monday\u2019s close. Gelsinger declined to give pricing but said that his chips would be \u201ca lot below\u201d the cost of Nvidia\u2019s current and future chips. They\u2019ll provide an \u201cextremely good\u201d total cost of ownership, he said.  Challenging Nvidia won\u2019t be easy. The runaway success of that company\u2019s H100 accelerator helped more than double revenue and sent its market valuation over $2 trillion. And now Nvidia is looking to build on its lead with a just-announced chip platform called Blackwell. Systems based on that product will be available later this year, the company said in March. Read More: Nvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell Chips According to Intel\u2019s assessment, Gaudi 3 will be faster and more power-efficient than the H100. It will train certain types of AI models 1.7 times more quickly and be 1.5 times better at running the software, the chipmaker claims. The product will be roughly equal with Nvidia\u2019s newer H200, Intel said, performing slightly better in some areas and a bit behind in others. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, said it can\u2019t provide comparisons with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell line until those products are publicly available. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. \u2014 its longtime competitor in personal computer processors \u2014 also is pushing into the field. It unveiled an accelerator lineup called MI300 in December.   Story Continues Intel\u2019s Gelsinger has said that he\u2019s not just trying to catch up with Nvidia. He expects AI to bring a bigger windfall for the industry \u2014 especially as the technology spreads beyond its current concentration in the data centers of companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Personal computers, mobile phones and networking gear will require chips that are able to handle AI tasks and provide users with instantaneous feedback \u2014 something that\u2019s not always possible with remote server farms.When Intel announced its fourth-quarter results in late January, Gelsinger said he was increasing the supply of Gaudi to meet growing orders and that the company has a \u201cpipeline\u201d for 2024 of \u201cabove $2 billion and growing.\u201d The broader market for corporate spending on generative AI gear will increase from $40 billion in 2024 to $151 billion in 2027, Intel said, citing market research.But that just underscores how much of a lead Nvidia has. The company had data center revenue of more than $47 billion during the 12 months ended in January. In its current fiscal year, that total will top $95 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates.(Updates with CEO comment starting in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Race for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data Centers Cocoa\u2019s Surge Is Drawing Africa\u2019s Farmers Back to the Bean Toyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

It turns out this longtime open-source Nouveau driver developer is now employed by NVIDIA Corp and continuing to work on the open-source Linux graphics driver.\r Ben Skeggs is at NVIDIA. I'm not sure what is more surprising that he is at the green giant or that he's able to continue working on the Nouveau driver in an official capacity. Ben Skeggs has been involved with the Nouveau project for more than a decade.\r After months of being absent in Nouveau driver development happenings, last night he posted a set of 156 patches. This massive patch series is a follow-up to the Nouveau GSP firmware enablement work and cleans up the code. The focus on the series is replacing the ioctl-like interface between the NVKM and the Nouveau DRM driver to now leverage more direct calls for reducing the driver overhead and call chain complexity. In the process there's also a fair amount of code cleaning. The 156 patches affect around ten thousand lines of code.\r And this big patch series is submitted from his new NVIDIA work email address:\r While NVIDIA has their open (out of tree) kernel drivers these days, it wasn't on my bingo card to see Ben Skeggs at NVIDIA and to continue contributing directly to Nouveau.

Although nothing has surpassed the advent of the internet in terms of game-changing potential for corporate America, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) may give it a run for its money.\nWhen discussing AI, I'm talking about the use of software and systems in place of humans. With machine learning, these systems can evolve over time without human intervention to become more proficient at their tasks, or perhaps expand their scope of work to include entirely new tasks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nLast year, the analysts at PwC released a report (\"Sizing the Prize, PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution\") that estimated AI would add close to $16 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. If this prognostication is anywhere in the ballpark to what actually occurs in six years' time, AI stocks have the potential to skyrocket.\nNo publicly traded company has arguably benefited more from the AI revolution than semiconductor titan Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%).\nWall Street's top billionaire money managers bid adieu to Nvidia\nSeemingly overnight, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the talk of businesses wanting to harness the power of AI. For the moment, the company's A100 and H100 GPUs have a borderline monopoly on GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia also has the luxury of exceptional pricing power. Enterprise demand for the company's GPUs has completely overwhelmed the supply of these products. The law of supply and demand suggests that if an in-demand product is in short supply, the price of that product will increase until demand wanes.\nBut not all Wall Street professionals are sold on the idea that Nvidia is the AI stock to own. During the December-ended quarter, eight high-profile billionaires reduced their respective fund's stakes in the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares)\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares)\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares)\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares)\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\n\nWhile a lot has gone right for Nvidia since the opening bell rang in 2023, the company is now facing a growing list of headwinds.\nFor starters, its immaculate pricing power is likely to decline in the quarters to come. Nvidia is increasing its production of AI-focused GPUs and will be facing an influx of competition. A majority of the 217% sales growth registered in Nvidia's data center segment in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024) was the result of strong pricing power tied to GPU scarcity. This scarcity won't be a tailwind for much longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add to the above, Nvidia has more than external competition to worry about. Its four largest customers by revenue -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are developing in-house AI chips for their respective data centers. This is approximately 40% of Nvidia's net sales at risk of being lost or diminished.\nRegulators have been of no help, either. On two separate occasions, U.S. regulators have restricted exports of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs to China, the world's No. 2 economy. This includes the toned-down A800 and H800 GPUs Nvidia had specifically designed for its Chinese customers.\nLastly, every next-big-thing innovation over the past three decades has worked its way through an early period of euphoria. In other words, bubbles are the expectation when investors pile into a new trend, and AI is unlikely to be an exception.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires are piling into two of Nvidia's top artificial intelligence rivals\nBut while billionaire investors were busy ringing the register on Nvidia during the fourth quarter, they were, interestingly enough, also piling into two of the company's chief architectural rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nThe first core competitor found in AI-accelerated data centers that top-tier billionaire asset managers gravitated to during the December-ended quarter is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.52%). Form 13F flings show that four billionaires were buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (4,737,399 shares)\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (3,506,881 shares)\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (570,035 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (23,383 shares)\n\nThe driving force behind this excitement looks to be the ramp up of AMD's MI300X AI-GPU. When AMD unveiled its flagship MI300X in June, it was billed as a \"generative AI accelerator.\" This is a fancy way of saying that it'll be going toe-to-toe with Nvidia's H100 to power generative AI solutions and train large language models (LLMs) for businesses. Although the rollout of the MI300X began last year, production wasn't expected to meaningfully pick up until this year.\n\nBut what investors might be overlooking is that AMD has more going for it than just its AI ambitions. Over the past decade, it's been steadily \"chipping away\" at Intel's (INTC 1.75%) central processing unit (CPU) share lead in personal computers (PCs) and data centers. Even though CPUs aren't growing at anywhere close to the same pace as GPUs, AMD's share gains in these segments are providing a hearty boost to operating cash flow.\nTo add, the PC market should enjoy a bit of a rebound in the not-too-distant future. Though demand for PCs soared then plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD notes that Client segment sales surged 62% from the prior-year period during the fourth quarter. It would appear that a stabilization in PC sales is well underway.\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaires might also be excited about AMD's growth prospects, relative to Nvidia. Whereas Wall Street's consensus pegs Nvidia to grow its earnings per share (EPS) by 24.6% next year, the forecast for AMD calls for EPS growth of 26%.\nIntel\nThe second artificial intelligence rival of Nvidia that billionaires can't stop buying is Intel. During the December-ended quarter, five billionaire money managers purchased shares, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,735,308 shares)\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,532,812 shares)\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (817,955 shares)\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (452,556 shares)\n\nSimilar to AMD, Intel is attempting to grab its share of the AI-accelerated data center market with the introduction of Gaudi 3. The company officially unveiled its H100 competitor last week as a tool that'll power LLMs and generative AI solutions for broad-scale businesses.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about Intel's GPU lineup is that it's developed a compliant version for export to China that meets the conditions laid out by U.S. regulators. Neither Nvidia nor AMD have laid out products or plans to make that happen as of yet. Although Nvidia is the undisputed market share leader in high-compute data centers domestically, Intel could reasonably become the preferred choice in the world's No. 2 economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond AI, Intel has its legacy CPU operations to fall back on. Though AMD has been gaining share in recent years, Intel remains the runaway leader in PC and data center CPU share. This means it's generating plenty of cash flow to fund other high-growth initiatives.\nFurthermore, Intel is busy building its foundry services segment from the ground up. Even though its foundry operations are expected to generate sizable losses for the foreseeable future, Intel's aggressive investments in chip fabrication have it on track to become the world's No. 2 foundry by the turn of the decade.\nIntel is one of the few semiconductor stocks that would probably be well-insulated if the AI bubble burst -- and billionaire asset managers likely know it.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

These new chips can reportedly process trillion-parameter models with constant uptime for superscale generative AI training and inference workloads. Source: NvidiaUntil recently, Nvidia was a technology supplier whose products were largely used in the automation sector primarily for advanced simulation graphics. And that makes sense because Nvidia is well-known for its graphics processing unit technology, better known by the acronym GPU. Because of this, Nvidia has long been a major player in the gaming industry.\u00a0\nBut Nvidia has become much more than a GPU supplier, as it has expanded into a full-stack computing company that, for the manufacturing and processing industries, reaches into artificial intelligence, digital twins and robotics.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been hearing more and more about industrial automation companies aligning with Nvidia to deliver advanced technologies that enable manufacturing companies to digitally transform and achieve Industry 4.0 goals.\nUntil Nvidia\u2019s recent conference unleashed a wave of industrial automation-related news, some of the biggest Nvidia news of interest for manufacturers related to the company\u2019s work with:\n\nSiemens around industrial metaverse development.\nToyota and Ready Robotics revolving around the use of Nvidia's Isaac Sim environment for easier robot programming.\u00a0\u00a0\nMercedes-Benz deployment of its Mercedes Modular Architecture which relies on digital twins powered Nvidia's Omniverse technology.\nRobot end effector supplier Schunk and Ready Robotics on the use of siimulation to support specification, deployment and re-deployment of automated systems.\n\nOf course, beyond these announcements, there\u2019s also been several automation device related releases featuring embedded Nvidia technology. Just type in Nvidia into the search bar on the automationworld.com site and you\u2019ll quickly see how widespread the use of Nvidia technologies has become in the industrial automation sector.\nBut apparently, all this news was just a prelude to the avalanche of industrial automation news to come out of Nvidia\u2019s recent conference in March 2024.\nTo give you an idea of how pervasive Nvidia technology is becoming to industrial automation, here\u2019s a rundown of some of the biggest news to come out of that conference.\nFirst up, Rockwell Automation announced a strategic collaboration with Nvidia to accelerate its next-generation industrial architecture that will impact Rockwell Automation\u2019s portfolio of software, hardware and services. Rockwell Automation plans to integrate Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces with its Emulate3D digital twin application. Rockwell says this will enable factory analysis, including operations and simulation, to be quicker and more predictive. As part of this partnership, Nvidia has joined the Rockwell Automation PartnerNetwork, allowing Rockwell Automation customers to access their applications more directly.\nNext, Siemens announced that it plans to deepen its existing work with Nvidia around the industrial metaverse. Here, Siemens will add Nvidia Omniverse Cloud programming interfaces to its Xcelerator platform for artificial intelligence-driven digital twin development. At the Nvidia conference, Siemens and Nvidia demonstrated how generative AI is being used to visualize complex industrial data, making photorealism in digital twins possible. As an example, the companies showed how shipbuilder HD Hyundai is using it to develop new ammonia- and hydrogen-powered ships, which can contain more than seven million discrete parts. HD Hyundai is using Nvidia\u2019s and Siemens generative AI technology to unify and visualize these massive engineering datasets interactively.\nSiemens also announced that it will release a new product later this year for Teamcenter X, the company\u2019s cloud-based Product Lifecycle Management software, which is part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform. According to Siemens, this new product will provide engineering teams with the ability to create a photorealistic, real-time, and physics-based digital twin to eliminate workflow waste and errors.\u00a0 \u00a0\nSiemens is focusing on the photorealistic renderings enabled by Nvidia\u2019s technology using generative AI to accelerate development tasks that previously took days to complete but can now be done in hours, with engineering data contextualized as it would appear in the real world.\u00a0Interoperable, photoreal and physics-based digital twins like this one, created with Siemens and Nvidia technology for HD Hyundai, accelerate engineering collaboration and allow customers to minimize workflow waste, save time and costs, and reduce risk of manufacturing defects. Source: NvidiaSchneider Electric is working with Nvidia to optimize data center infrastructure to enable edge artificial intelligence and digital twin technologies. Schneider Electric says it plans to introduce the first publicly available AI data center reference designs. These designs will be used to \u201credefine the benchmarks for AI deployment and operation within data center ecosystems\u201d according to Schneider Electric.\nThis focus on the use of AI applications in data centers is gaining traction across industries as the need for processing power has surged exponentially.\u00a0\nIn the first phase of this collaboration, Schneider Electric will introduce data center reference designs tailored for Nvidia accelerated computing clusters and built for data processing, engineering simulation, electronic design automation, computer-aided drug design, and generative AI applications.\u00a0\nIn addition to the data center applications, Aveva, which is a subsidiary of Schneider Electric, will connect its digital twin platform to Nvidia Omniverse, to deliver a unified environment for virtual simulation and collaboration. This integration will reportedly enable collaboration between designers, engineers and other stakeholders to accelerate the design and deployment of complex systems, while helping reduce time-to-market and associated costs.\nTeradyne Robotics, which includes the collaborative robot company Universal Robots and autonomous mobile robot company MiR, also announced a collaboration with Nvidia. \u00a0\nAs part of this collaboration, Universal Robots has integrated Nvidia accelerated computing into its UR5e cobot platform for faster path planning, which reportedly makes the path planning process 50 to 80 times faster. This application combines Nvidia\u2019s Jetson AGX Orin system-on-module designed for edge AI applications, the cuMotion path planner from the NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator platform and Universal Robots\u2019 new PolyScope X software. \u00a0\nFor MiR\u2019s 1200 Pallet Jack, the company is also using Nvidia\u2019s Jetson AGX Orin module. Here, the MiR1200 Pallet Jack combines data from four RGBD cameras for fast and precise pallet handling. Feeding this camera data into the Nvidia Jetson platform fuses the camera data and 3D LiDAR data to detect obstacles in 3D space for fully autonomous navigation.\u00a0MiR1200 Pallet Jack.

And today that spirit of spring cleaning is coming to the entry-level segment of NVIDIA\u2019s professional visualization lineup, where NVIDIA is introducing a pair of new desktop cards based on their low-end Ampere hardware.\nThe new RTX A1000 and RTX A400 cards will be replacing the T1000/T600/T400 lineup, which was released three years ago in 2021. The new cards slot into the same entry-level category and finally finish fleshing out the RTX A series of proviz cards, offering NVIDIA\u2019s Ampere-generation professional graphics technologies in the lowest-power, lowest-performance, lowest-cost configuration possible.\nNotably, since the entry-level T-series were based on NVIDIA\u2019s feature-limited TU11x silicon, which lacked ray tracing and tensor core support \u2013 the basis of NVIDIA\u2019s RTX technologies and associated branding \u2013 this marks the first time these technologies will be available in NVIDIA\u2019s entry-level desktop proviz cards. And accordingly, these are being promoted to RTX-branded video cards, ending the odd overlap with NVIDIA\u2019s compute cards, which never carry RTX branding.\nIt goes without saying that as low-end cards, the ray tracing performance of either part is nothing to write home about, but it gives NVIDIA\u2019s current proviz lineup a consistent set of graphics features from top to bottom.\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Professional Visualization Card Specification Comparison\n\n\n\u00a0\nA1000\nA400\nT1000\nT400\n\n\nCUDA Cores\n2304\n768\n896\n384\n\n\nTensor Cores\n72\n24\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nBoost Clock\n1460MHz\n1755MHz\n1395MHz\n1425MHz\n\n\nMemory Clock\n12Gbps GDDR6\n12Gbps GDDR6\n10Gbps GDDR6\n10Gbps\r\n\t\t\tGDDR6\n\n\nMemory Bus Width\n128-bit\n64-bit\n128-bit\n64-bit\n\n\nVRAM\n8GB\n4GB\n8GB\n4GB\n\n\nSingle Precision\n6.74 TFLOPS\n2.7 TFLOPS\n2.5 TFLOPS\n1.09 TFLOPS\n\n\nTensor Performance\n53.8 TFLOPS\n21.7 TFLOPS\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nTDP\n50W\n50W\n50W\n30W\n\n\nCooling\nActive, SS\nActive, SS\nActive, SS\nActive, SS\n\n\nOutputs\n4x mDP 1.4a\n4x mDP 1.4a\n3x mDP 1.4a\n\n\nGPU\nGA107\nTU117\n\n\nArchitecture\nAmpere\nTuring\n\n\nManufacturing Process\nSamsung 8nm\nTSMC 12nm\n\n\nLaunch Date\n04/2024\n05/2024\n05/2021\n05/2021\n\n\n\nBoth the A1000 and A400 are based on the same board design, with NVIDIA doing away with any pretense of physical feature differentiation this time around (T400 was missing its 4th Mini DisplayPort). This means both cards are based on the GA107 GPU, sporting different core and memory configurations.\nRTX A1000 is a not-quite-complete configuration of GA107, with 2304 CUDA cores and 72 tensor cores. This is paired with 8GB of GDDR6, which runs at 12Gbps, for a total of 192GB/second of memory bandwidth. The TDP of the card is 50 Watts, matching its predecessor.\n\nMeanwhile RTX A400 is far more cut down, offering about a third of the active hardware on the GPU itself, and half the memory bandwidth. On paper this gives it around 40% of T1000\u2019s performance, and half the memory bandwidth \u2013 or 96GB/second. Notably, despite the hardware cut-down, the official TDP is still 50 Watts, versus the 30 Watts of its predecessor. So at this point NVIDIA will soon cease offering a desktop proviz card lower than 50 Watts.\nAs noted before, both cards otherwise feature the same physical design, with a half-height half-length (HHHL) board with active cooling. As you\u2019d expect from such low-TDP cards, these are single-slot cooler designs. Both cards feature a quartet of Mini DisplayPorts, with the same DP 1.4a functionality that we\u2019ve seen across all of NVIDIA\u2019s products for the last several years.\nFinally, video-focused users will want to make note that the A1000/A400 have slightly different video capabilities. While A1000 gets access to both of GA107\u2019s NVDEC video decode blocks, A400 only gets access to a single block \u2013 one more cutback to differentiate the two cards. Otherwise, both video cards get access to the GPU\u2019s sole NVENC block.\nAccording to NVIDIA, the RTX A1000 will be available starting today through its distribution partners.

Students will be able to access the cluster online for projects related to computer vision, large language models, robotics, generative AI design, and chemical or biomedical engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\u2013 Georgia Institute of Technology\n\n\n\nInterconnected with a Nvidia Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform, the supercomputer is comprised of 20 Nvidia HGX H100 systems and 160 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs. No information about the total compute power offered by the Makerspace was provided but each individual eight-GPU HGX H100 system is capable of achieving 480 teraflops of FP64 compute power, meaning the system could potentially offer around 10 AI petaflops of compute power.Georgia Tech said the system has been deployed by Penguin Solutions (formerly Penguin Computing), which has also provided a virtual gateway to the high-performance computing environment.Students and staff will also have access to Nvidia\u2019s Deep Learning Institute resources, including Nvidia workshops, certifications, curriculum-aided teaching kits, and access to the company\u2019s developer community network.\u201cThe launch of the AI Makerspace represents another milestone in Georgia Tech\u2019s legacy of innovation and leadership in education,\u201d said Raheem Beyah, dean of the College and Southern Company Chair. \u201cThanks to Nvidia\u2019s advanced technology and expertise, our students at all levels have a path to make significant contributions and lead in the rapidly evolving field of AI.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in HPC & Quantum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Sep 2024\n\n\n\n\nGerman cybersecurity agency awards three mobile quantum computer contracts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Dec 2024\n\n\n\n\nGoogle debuts Willow quantum computing chip, claims new breakthroughs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nThe architecture of a supercomputer: A journey into advanced HPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in North America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDCD>Leadership Summit - Sample Delegate List\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 Oct 2024\n\n\n\n\nS&P: Data center growth to precipitate natural gas demand in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\nHut 8 secures 592 acres for 300MW Bitcoin and AI data center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\n\nPenguin Computing\n\n\nAI Makerspace\n\n\nRaheem Beyah\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nPenguin Solutions\n\n\nAtlanta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The company's Gaudi 3 chip matches and exceeds Nvidia\u2019s H100 AI processor\u00a0when it comes to training and deploying generative AI models. The H100 is one of Nvidia's most popular chips, powering artificial intelligence applications for some of the world's biggest tech companies, from Microsoft to Google.  According to Intel, the Gaudi 3 is 40% more power efficient with 50% faster inferencing than Nvidia\u2019s H100. Training refers to the time it takes to train an AI foundation model like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3, while inferencing is the process of actually using the models for apps. Intel says the Gaudi 3 is up to 1.7 times faster when training common large language models than the H100. Intel even says its chip is an average of 1.3 times faster than Nvidia\u2019s beefier Nvidia H200 when it comes to inferencing certain language models. In addition to the Gaudi line of chips and Xeon CPUs, Intel is also marketing so-called AI PCs, computers equipped with neural processing units that can handle onboard AI tasks. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Intel Corporation (INTC)   Follow    View Quote Details    26.11 +0.42 (+1.65%)  As of 2:58:31 PM EDT. Market Open.   INTC AMD NVDA   Advanced Chart    These AI maneuvers come at a critical time for Intel. The company is working to reinvent itself as the leader in sophisticated chip technology while building out its chip manufacturing capabilities in the US and abroad. This includes a foundry business that will build Intel\u2019s own chips as well as those for third-party customers. The company has already confirmed it will build chips for Microsoft. But this reinvention is coming at a steep cost, with Intel announcing earlier this month a $7 billion operating loss for 2023 as part of its new financial reporting structure. Intel stock is down 25% so far this year. Rivals Nvidia and AMD (AMD), conversely, are up 15% and 74% so far this year, respectively.  Intel has been teasing the Gaudi 3 chip for some time, with CEO Pat Gelsinger showing off a version of the platform during a December press event. It\u2019s seen as Intel\u2019s best chance yet to compete with Nvidia in the AI market, a space the graphics chip giant dominates thanks to its powerful hardware and software.   Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger discusses his company's plans to capitalize on the booming demand for the chips needed to power artificial intelligence during a conference in San Jose, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024. (Michael Liedtke/AP Photo)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS The company's new chips also come just a month after Nvidia debuted its own next-generation AI platform called Blackwell. That system includes Nvidia\u2019s B200 AI chip, which is made up of two Blackwell chips mated together to act as a single processor. Intel is putting its AI systems forward as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s offerings, claiming an open-source approach that will allow customers to use the services and software that they want.   Story Continues And while Nvidia is the leader in overall AI technology, Intel is betting enterprises will remain wary of sticking with a single source for high-value needs like AI hardware.For instance, hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others already either offer their own AI chips or are developing them in addition to using Nvidia\u2019s chips.  Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo FinanceIntel\u2019s Gaudi 3 will give those hyperscalers another option in the chip market.Intel also announced on Tuesday a new form of Ethernet connectivity for Gaudi 3 nodes, competing with Nvidia\u2019s InfiniBand connectivity technology to ensure uninterrupted connections and processing. The company also debuted its Xeon 6 processors for use in AI systems.Taking a page out of Nvidia\u2019s book, Intel is offering the entire setup as a reference design that partners like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Super Micro can use to build their own server cabinets.Intel says customers will be able to order the Gaudi 3-powered systems in sizes ranging from individual nodes and small boxes to enormous megaclusters that can fill entire data centers.Corretion: An earlier version of this story said HP will be one if Intel's partners; it is actually HPE.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Flores, NVIDIA\u2019s head of medical AI. The two discussed how artificial intelligence is powering the future of biomedicine. \n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo cure, prevent or manage all diseases by the end of the century is an audacious mission. When Mark and I set this goal for our science work eight years ago, we wanted to push the limits of what we thought was possible, and we didn\u2019t want our own ambitions to be the cap on what we could achieve.\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to do something I never thought I would do: speak at an AI conference. And yet, I found myself sitting on stage at NVIDIA GTC, sharing the progress that we have made to build tools and fund efforts to generate rich biological datasets that are primed for the acceleration we\u2019re seeing today in AI technology. Combining these datasets with the power of large language models is the next step in reaching our goal of helping scientists unlock new treatments and cures.\nThe story of how we got here \u2014 a philanthropy with a moonshot mission and me speaking at a cutting-edge AI conference \u2014 has an unlikely origin: my grandparents.\nMy grandparents on both sides of my family were living in Vietnam during the war in the \u201870s. Because of the war, the only way to flee the violence was to get on small fishing boats and float into the South China Sea to look for a safe harbor. These boats weren\u2019t sturdy, and my grandparents had heard terrible stories of boats sinking and taking the lives of entire families with them. Still, they believed a better future was out there and were willing to take the risk. So, my grandparents paired up their young children \u2014 one from each family \u2014 and sent them out on the boats by themselves. The oldest kids left first. My grandparents left last. And it took almost 10 years, but eventually, everyone was safely reunited.\nMy grandparents had enough hope and optimism to take that risk. I believe it\u2019s in my epigenetics \u2014 coded in my DNA \u2014 to take big bets, too. CZI\u2019s work to help scientists cure disease is our way of doing that. And we think AI is pivotal to how we get there.\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Priscilla Chan (@priscillachan)\nThat\u2019s why our next big bet is to build AI-powered virtual cells. Utilizing one of the largest high-performance AI computing systems for nonprofit life science research, we hope to help scientists explore the molecular underpinnings of human health and disease.\nWe\u2019re still in the early days of our AI strategy, and we won\u2019t build virtual cell models overnight. But, we\u2019re laying the foundation by bringing on AI experts from academia and industry to help guide our projects. We\u2019ve started to build our first foundational virtual cell models that will be trained on biologically important data sources that we\u2019ve been contributing to and supporting for years. These datasets will include those from our CELLxGENE software tool, large datasets from our Imaging Institute, and resources built by Biohub San Francisco.\nProjects spearheaded by CZI\u2019s new AI residents will lay the foundation for virtual cell models. | Photograph courtesy of Donghui Li\nThese AI cell models will be able to do science beyond what humans can conceive of right now \u2014 connecting dots that we couldn\u2019t connect before.\nFor example, more than 7,000 rare diseases affect over 300 million people globally. And, while a particular rare disease may be unique and hard to understand, AI can help us identify diseases with similar characteristics \u2014 allowing us to test if treatments for more well-known conditions could work for rare ones. That\u2019s a potential game-changer for someone with a rare disease who has reached the limits of what medicine can offer them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for Updates\nJoin our mailing list for the latest virtual cell news, collaboration opportunities, and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors will one day be able to use a virtual cell model to predict the efficacy of a cancer treatment before prescribing it to their patients. Or, they could tell you how genetic mutations will affect your well-being in 20 years and what can be done to prevent new diseases from progressing \u2014 decades before symptoms appear.\nAnd then there\u2019s the brain. Imagine if AI could show us how to design treatments that can move past the blood-brain barrier more effectively or target different cellular mutations within a single tumor.\nThose are only a few examples of the incredible possibilities of AI and medicine, and I\u2019m excited to see the beginnings of even more.\nLike my grandparents, I have hope for a better future, one where we can apply AI to biology at scale and pave the way for new biomedical discoveries.\nWith care,\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCo-Founder and Co-CEO\nChan Zuckerberg Initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE\nWatch: Priscilla Chan on CZI\u2019s Science Milestones and What\u2019s Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE\n2024 in Review: How AI Shaped a Year of Impact at CZI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding A Better Future for Everyone\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\nOur Approach\nOur Leadership\nAnnual Letter\nInvesting our Endowment\nEthics Policies and Guidelines\nCareers\n\n\nWhat We Do\nScience\nEducation\nCommunity\n\n\nHow We Work\nTechnology\nGrants & Ventures\nCapabilities & Resources\n\n\nNews & Stories\nNewsroom\nStories\nVideos\nMedia Gallery\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2025 The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative |\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\tDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSitemap\t\t\t\t \n\n\nWe use cookies to help us improve the site and to inform our marketing and digital content efforts.

Cloud computing giants have been lining up to get the company's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and power their large language models (LLMs).\nFor Meta Platforms (META -3.26%), Microsoft, Amazon, and many others, Nvidia has been the go-to provider of AI chips. It is worth noting that these tech giants have been willing to wait as long as a year between order and delivery to procure Nvidia's chips, and they have been paying top dollar for them. Other chipmakers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.52%) have been left in the dust in this niche: By some estimates, Nvidia controls a whopping 95% of the AI chip market.\nAs a result, Nvidia's earnings and revenue multiplied rapidly. However, some of its customers are making concerted efforts to reduce their reliance on its chips.\n\nMaking AI chips in-house\nNvidia's success in the AI GPU market can be credited to its A100 processor, which it launched in 2020. The graphics chip specialist built this GPU for high-performance computing applications, and it was manufactured using a 7-nanometer (nm) process node. OpenAI reportedly deployed thousands of A100 chips to train ChatGPT.\nInterestingly, near the end of 2021, rival AMD started offering a competing data center accelerator that was built on a 6nm process node -- the MI250X. However, the A100 reportedly outperformed the newer AMD chip in LLM training training tasks, per third-party estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in 2022, Nvidia upped its game with the H100 processor, which is built on a custom 5nm process. The company packed 80 billion transistors into the chip as compared to 54 billion on the A100. The H100 turned out to be significantly more powerful than its predecessor. AMD, on the other hand, took until the end of 2023 to arrive with its next competing chip, the MI300.\nThis explains why Nvidia's H100 was in terrific demand last year, driving $47.5 billion in data center revenue for the company in its fiscal 2024 as compared to $15 billion in the previous year. Meta alone shelled out billions of dollars to Nvidia for H100s, and it wasn't the only big buyer to do so.\nHowever, the lack of a potent alternative to the H100, its high pricing, and its thin availability explain why some of Nvidia's top customers started in-house AI chip development efforts to reduce their reliance on the chipmaker. Meta Platforms, for instance, recently announced the second generation of its own AI chip, which is built on a 5nm process node.\nAccording to Meta, the new chip \"more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of our previous solution while maintaining our close tie-in to our workloads. It is designed to efficiently serve the ranking and recommendation models that provide high-quality recommendations to users.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, Meta plans to continue its in-house chip development program as it looks to reduce the operating and development costs of its AI servers.\nSomething similar is happening at Microsoft. The tech giant revealed two custom AI chips toward the end of 2023, one of which is a 5nm AI accelerator called Maia 100. This AI chip reportedly has 105 billion transistors and has been built for running AI workloads in the cloud, including LLM training and inference.\nAmazon, too, has gone down the in-house AI chip development route. It revealed its latest offering, the Trainium2, in November, which it claims is 4 times more powerful than its predecessor. Amazon Web Services customers have the option of using these chips to train AI models. Meanwhile, Alphabet has jumped onto this bandwagon with its newly revealed Axion custom AI processor.\nGiven that Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon were among the top buyers of H100 processors last year, their focus on in-house chip development is no doubt a threat to the semiconductor giant's bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors, however, should focus on the bigger picture\nWhile it is true that Nvidia's customers are looking to reduce their reliance on it, the fact remains that they are expected to continue buying its powerful GPUs. For instance, when Nvidia announced the launch of its next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs last month, all the companies mentioned above said they would deploy the new chips once they were available.\nThat's not surprising. Nvidia's upcoming GPUs are expected to be significantly more powerful, enabling customers to train even bigger LLMs. The chipmaker claims that the Blackwell GPU can run LLMs \"at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\" Given that it is likely to price these new GPUs competitively compared to the H100, Nvidia's customers could witness stronger returns on their AI hardware investments with Blackwell processors.\nAs a result, the demand for Nvidia's AI chips could continue to remain robust. Another reason why Nvidia could remain the dominant player in the AI chip market is because of its control over the supply chain. Nvidia's customers and rivals are turning to foundry giant TSMC to manufacture their own AI chips, but Nvidia reportedly consumes 60% of TSMC's advanced chip packaging capacity.\nOf course, TSMC is looking to increase its capacity to meet the demand from Nvidia and other customers, but the GPU specialist is likely to lock up the biggest share of the foundry's added output, considering the massive lead it already enjoys in the AI chip market.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, even if other big tech players continue their chip development efforts, Nvidia is likely to remain the top AI chip player for quite some time. Japanese investment bank Mizuho estimates that Nvidia could sell $280 billion worth of AI chips in 2027 as it projects the overall market hitting $400 billion. So while Mizuho is forecasting that Nvidia's share of the AI chip market will come down over the next three years, it expects its data center revenue to rise significantly.\nAs such, Nvidia's data center revenue is likely to keep growing at a healthy pace thanks to the secular growth opportunity in AI chips, even if the company loses some market share. That's why investors shouldn't worry a lot about the chip development moves of Nvidia's customers. Instead, considering the impressive catalysts it is sitting on, they should view its recent pullback as an opportunity to buy more shares.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

[+] a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nStock prices move up or down depending on the gap between a company\u2019s performance and investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nAn unusual way to fall short of such expectations occurred last Friday. That\u2019s when Super Micro Computer\nSMCI\n, a maker of Nvidia-based servers, failed to preannounce better-than-expected results for the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, reported CNBC.\n\n\nNvidia and Super Micro are tightly linked. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as did Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Liang founded Super Micro in 1993 and has been collaborating with Nvidia for more than 30 years, I noted in a February 2024 Forbes post.\n\nThis long-standing partnership bodes well for Super Micro\u2019s future \u2014 as long as demand for Nvidia chips remains strong. \u201cWhatever Nvidia develops, we pretty much sync up with them,\u201d Liang told CRN. \u201cAnd that's another reason why, whenever they have a new product out, we have a new product available quicker than our competitors do,\u201d he added.\n\n\nVery few companies regularly preannounce upbeat results before their official reporting date. But Super Micro did just that in January \u2014 stunning \u201cWall Street last quarter when it preannounced results substantially higher than what analysts had been expecting,\u201d according to MarketWatch.\nOn April 19, Super Micro \u2014 which will report quarterly results on April 30 \u2014 failed to deliver another such upside surprise.\nInvestors sent the company\u2019s stock down 23%. \u201cExpectations were they would positively preannounce like they did in January,\u201d Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein told MarketWatch. Super Micro shares are up 150% in 2024 \u2014 leaving \u201czero room for error,\u201c he added.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s failure to preannounce \u201craises questions about the strength of the quarter,\u201d Klein said. \u201cSo now it becomes a waiting game until they report and can guide the next quarter. But until they do that, hedge funds will short it and retail fast-money traders likely de-risk.\u201d\n\nSuper Micro\u2019s failure to preannounce may also have hurt Nvidia \u2014 sending the GPU-maker\u2019s stock down 10% last Friday.\nDoes this mean the generative AI bull run is over? Here are two reasons a temporary correction in generative AI stock prices may be in the offing:\n\n\n\n\nGrowth expectations are rising above what companies can deliver.\nMany companies have yet to identify and deploy the highest payoff generative AI applications.\n\n\nUntil generative AI delivers significant, expectations-beating revenue and productivity growth, investors could shy away from stocks in this group.\nGrowth Expectations May Be Too High To Beat\nUnless publicly traded companies beat expectations for the most recently completed quarter and raise guidance for the future, investors will dump their shares.\nEach time a company accomplishes this feat of beating and raising, investors raise the bar even higher. Eventually, the company fails to deliver expectations-beating results and the stock plunges \u2014 and then stagnates until the company beats and raises again.\nGrowth expectations are very high for Super Micro and Nvidia.\nSuper Micro\u2019s Triple-Digit Revenue Growth Forecast\nHere are key forecasts for Super Micro\u2019s growth:\n\n\nQ3 2024 net sales forecast: $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, according to CNBC \u2014 the midpoint of which is 205% higher than sales achieved the year before.\nFY 2024 net sales forecast: $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion and about 40% more than the company\u2019s initial guidance, CNBC reported. The midpoint of the latest guidance is 104% higher than the previous year\u2019s results.\n\n\nNvidia Triple-Digit Growth Expectations\nHere are the key numbers investors are looking for from Nvidia:\n\n\nFY 2025 Q1 net sales forecast: $24.22 billion \u2014 237% more than the year before, according to Yahoo! Finance.\nFY 2025 Q1 gross margin forecast: 77.03% \u2014 13 percentage points more than the year before, Yahoo! Finance notes.\nFY 2025 Q1 adjusted earnings per share forecast: $5.50 \u2014 405% higher than the year before, according to CNBC.\n\n\nNvidia guided investors to expect 300% revenue growth to $24 billion in Q1 2025 \u2014 $2.4 billion more than the analysts\u2019 consensus, I wrote in a February Forbes post.\nGiven the high growth rates, I am skeptical that Super Micro and Nvidia will exceed these triple-digit growth expectations and raise their guidance when they report their latest results on April 30 and May 22, respectively.\nWhere Are The High-Payoff Generative AI Applications?\nUltimately the fate of generative AI picks-and-shovel suppliers will depend on whether the miners \u2014 companies buying the AI technology \u2014 identify and operate high payoff applications. My forthcoming book, Brain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI, includes in-depth case studies of such applications.\nWhile companies are investing heavily to build AI-powered chatbots, not all of their experiments are boosting revenue and productivity. My research found that generative AI applications with a high return on investment do the following:\n\n\nThey deliver a quantum value leap\u2014enabling a big uptick in revenue and productivity\u2014in a company's critical business processes.\nThey attract new customers and keep current customers buying.\nThey are difficult for rivals to replicate.\n\n\nWhile I do not have audited financial results to confirm the ROI, here are two examples of generative AI applications sharing these three traits \u2014 and another that does not.\nBullhorn Boosts Its Clients\u2019 Productivity\nBullhorn is a 1,520 employee Boston-based provider of technology needed to place temporary workers. The company boosts its clients\u2019 productivity with help from AI.\nBullhorn's highest-payoff AI application helps the company's customers grow faster and boost productivity. In many cases, \"basic generative AI doesn't add value in and of itself, but combined with more sophisticated use cases, there is definitely opportunity to drive holistic value,\" Bullhorn president Matt Fischer told me in a March 26 interview.\n\"For example, you're not going to charge for one prompt, but once generative AI is integrated into the entire workflow, it becomes very valuable,\u201d Fischer adds. \u201cWe are monetizing machine learning to help recruiters match candidates to jobs more effectively.\"\nBullhorn's AI application analyzes the most successful temporary worker placements and uses the resulting model to help recruiting firms match candidates to jobs more effectively and efficiently.\nBecause Bullhorn built its matching model using a large number of successful placements, the company's AI boosts recruiters' revenue and profitability and is difficult for rivals to replicate.\n\"Our models are outcome-based\u2014successful placements,\" said Fischer. \"We track 54 vectors of more than 4.5 million successful job placements. We are planning to enhance this model with call transcripts, SMSs to candidates and clients, and emails.\"\nThe model pays off for Bullhorn's clients. \"Recruiters increase their placement rate from our model's recommendations\u2014to 25% or 35%. We help reduce candidate acquisition costs by increasing the redeployment rate of talent at the end of their contracts from 5% to 30%. We increase recruiter productivity from submission to placement by 68%,\u201d he concluded.\nDynatrace's\nDT\n CEO On Generative AI\u2019s Power To Attract And Repel Customers\nGenerative AI can help win new customers or send current customers away forever.\n\u201cA couple of preliminary killer apps will emerge for generative AI,\u201d Rick McConnell, CEO of Dynatrace, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based provider of software observability services, told me in a February 2024 interview.\nOne such killer app will be customer service. \"I was trying to fix a billing issue with a cellular provider and the chatbot solved the problem fast,\" McConnell notes.\n\"The second one went so badly that I will never do business with the company again,\u201d he adds. \u201cI was trying to correlate the contact lenses I received with the prescription. The contact lens provider's chatbot couldn't get me a solution. After three different segments, I never got it resolved.\u201d\nIt may be too early for comprehensive research on whether generative AI applications are earning their keep. These examples suggest some companies will succeed and others will fail.\nUntil there are well-documented examples of companies getting high ROI from such applications, the demand for the services, software, and hardware needed to power large language models could slow down.\nWhat Analysts Are Saying\nIs the market over-reacting to Super Micro\u2019s failure to preannounce or is a larger correction in the offing?\nJudging by 12-month price targets, Super Micro\u2019s stock plunge is a buying opportunity. Based on analysts offering 12-month price targets for the company, the average price target is $1047.45, according to Nasdaq, representing nearly 47% upside.\nHaving said that, analysts expressed strong disappointment with Super Micro on April 19. Examples include:\n\n\nRotation out of AI trade. \u201cPeople seemed to think the AI trade would go up forever. It got crowded and now it is unwinding something fierce,\u201d Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Triple D Trading told Bloomberg. \u201cThis is just a tech wreck, a rotation out of tech and the idea of tech as a safety trade. The AI trade in particular is unwinding,\u201d Dick added.\nNegative surprise. Super Micro\u2019s failure to provide a \u201cpositive preannouncement\u201d is seen as a negative and an important AI datapoint, wrote Wells Fargo Securities in a report featured by Bloomberg. \u201cI think if they were going to blow it away again, they probably would have said something. So that is maybe concerning a little bit,\u201d Dick added.\n\n\nWhat goes up, must go down. While Super Micro benefits from its ties to Nvidia when demand is rising, both companies could be hurt if growth slows. Moreover, rivals such as Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\nHPE\n will be competing with Super Micro \u2014 all of them are planning to build systems using Nvidia\u2019s latest generation of Blackwell GPUs, noted CNBC.\nGenerative AI is in trouble unless companies get a high ROI from the technology. If that happens, the short-term drops in Super Micro and Nvidia are great buying opportunities.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.
