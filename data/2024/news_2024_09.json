In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely. On a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the risks of straying too far from technology stocks, particularly the dominant tech companies, in today\u2019s market. He pointed out how JP Morgan, despite being one of the best-performing banks, caused a stir by cutting its forecast, warning that estimates might be overly optimistic. This news hurt the broader market, dropping it by 93 points, although the S&P 500 saw a slight rise of 0.54%, and the tech-driven NASDAQ gained 0.84%. \u201cIn this market, every time you stray too far from technology, especially the tech titans, you ultimately get slapped in the face by reality. That\u2019s what happened today when the largest, and arguably best-performing, bank in the world, laid a huge egg with its forecast. They told us the estimates are too high, maybe way too high. That spoiled a big chunk of the market, ultimately dipping 93 points. The S&P inched up 0.54%, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ still gained 0.84%.\u201d  Cramer explained that since the Federal Reserve gave positive signals, investors had shifted away from tech into other areas of the market. This shift was part of the \u201cbroadening out\u201d that many investors had been waiting for, as it was believed to signal a healthier market. Financial stocks, which make up around 13.3% of the S&P 500, had been a source of excitement for those tired of relying on the leading tech stocks. \u201cFor the past couple of months, ever since the Fed gave us the all-clear signal, we\u2019ve seen money flow out of tech into long-neglected regions of the stock market. This is the fabled \u201cbroadening out\u201d that people spent all year clamoring for. When we bring in more groups of winners, we\u2019re supposed to have a much healthier market, at least that\u2019s what they say. There are tons of financials in the S&P 500, about 13.3% of the index and the strength in those stocks was a source of much joy for everyone who had gotten sick of The Magnificent Seven.\u201d  However, as Cramer noted, economic uncertainty and disappointing forecasts from bank companies disrupted this broader market strength. Daniel Pinto, the bank company\u2019s COO, dashed hopes by signaling that the outlook for the bank wasn\u2019t as strong as expected. The key issue was that net interest income, a critical measure for banks, was projected to miss expectations due to reduced capital market activity. For Cramer, this underperformance highlighted the danger of moving away from tech stocks too soon.   Story Continues \u201cBut a funny thing happened on the way to that broadened-out market: we got economic choppiness. Or to use a more accurate phrase, we got guide-downs that were intolerable to any of the leaders, and the kiss of death to the stock of the bank. You can\u2019t be a leader when you\u2019re slashing your forecast for H2. That\u2019s when the shareholders kick you to the curb and find someone new to follow. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among Jim Cramer\u2019s Exclusive Stock to Monitor Closely?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179Jim Cramer believes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s recent revenue shortfall is primarily due to production delays for their new AI chip, Blackwell. He emphasizes that the demand for this chip remains extremely high, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making progress in addressing the supply issues. Cramer doesn\u2019t see this as a significant setback for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s overall performance.\u201cNow, I don\u2019t see much evidence of this, though the bears will point to NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s failure to report a spectacular revenue beat. But that only happened because their new AI chip, Blackwell, got delayed. They\u2019re having trouble producing it at scale, which is totally reasonable. But they\u2019ve basically solved the problem now. It\u2019s a supply problem, not a demand problem. Demand is off the charts.\u201d NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers a strong bullish case, supported by its outstanding financial performance and leadership in AI and GPU technology. In Q2 FY2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted remarkable earnings, with revenue soaring to $13.51 billion, a 101% year-over-year increase, largely driven by booming demand for AI and data center products. Notably, data center revenue surged by 171% to $10.32 billion, as businesses ramped up investments in AI infrastructure.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strategic partnerships with companies like VMware Inc. (NYSE:VMW), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Hugging Face further bolster its position in the AI ecosystem, while its H100 GPUs continue to set benchmarks in AI model training. New product releases, such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and AI Workbench, reinforce NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s growth across multiple sectors. Looking forward, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) projects even stronger results for Q3 2024, with expected revenue of $16 billion and gross margins between 74.8% and 75.5%.Analysts remain highly optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s future, driven by its technological dominance and the expanding global demand for AI. This combination of innovation, strategic partnerships, and market leadership makes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a compelling investment opportunity.Overall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of exclusive stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure:\u00a0None.

The tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.  It also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time. One bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.  MS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\" SEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley Returning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).   Story Continues The bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.August's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.Following the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"Subsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.Remaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow \u2013 requiring \u201cGoldilocks\u201d growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.Our MethodologyTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179Share Price Target Upside: 26%Share Price Target: $150NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's largest and most advanced graphics processing unit designer. Its GPUs, which offer businesses the ability to accelerate their workloads, are also key to its hypothesis. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s rapid share price growth of 715% since 2023 started is built on Wall Street's optimism of its GPUs being heavily demanded for enterprise computing use cases. Artificial intelligence is also one of these use cases, and as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have lost 12% since their June peak, the firm has sought to slightly shift the narrative. At a recent conference, CEO Jensen Huang shared that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also plays in a non AI $1 trillion market for GPUs that will help accelerate computing that has slowed down over the years due to physical limitations of CPU design. Naturally, this means that as long as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to design superior products and there is demand for them, its shares perform well. However, any inventory glut or growth in custom chips by the likes of Amazon and Meta could spell trouble.Baron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\u201cMore recently, however, we\u2019ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA\u2019s stock move today with Cisco\u2019s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we\u2019ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA\u2019s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows\u2013 not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA\u2019s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco\u2019s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

TipRanks   September 14, 2024 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMD   -0.64%       NVDA   -2.05%       SMCI   -6.70%       Advanced computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are arguably the most hyped technologies at the moment, making investment decisions in this area challenging.\u00a0This article compares three major players\u2014Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA)\u2014using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool. I\u2019ll explain why Nvidia, which I currently rate a Buy, is the best option for investors, while I maintain a Hold stance on both Super Micro Computer and AMD.    Before comparing these stocks, it\u2019s important to understand each company\u2019s role. NVIDIA and AMD provide graphics processing units (GPUs) used in servers and data centers, many of which are built by Super Micro Computer. While NVIDIA and AMD focus on accelerating computations, Super Micro supplies the needed infrastructure. Let\u2019s dive into the details. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) From a growth perspective, Super Micro Computer is a strong investment, although I currently rate the stock a Hold. The company\u2019s revenues surged 109.7% over the last 12 months, and its earnings increased 63.9% during the same period, driven by strong AI demand. Analysts expect Super Micro\u2019s revenue to grow by 88.3% this year, potentially reaching $28.14 billion. However, the company is facing challenges due to a recent report by Hindenburg Research, a notorious short seller, that has leveled claims of accounting manipulation at the company. This has led to a sharp decline in the share price and raised concerns about the company\u2019s management team. Shortly after the Hindenburg report was made public, Super Micro Computer delayed releasing its annual report. Is SMCI A Buy, Hold,\u00a0or\u00a0Sell? The current situation at Super Micro Computer makes it a risky investment, which is largely why I rate the stock a Hold. On the other hand, the stock, currently trading at $465, down from a peak of $1,229 reached in March of this year, could present a buy-the-dip opportunity if the allegations against the company are proven to be unfounded. Looking at momentum indicators, the stock is currently below its 10, 50, and 100-day moving averages, signaling short- and medium-term bearish momentum. However, trading below the 200-day average may signal an oversold condition, potentially offering a chance for contrarian investors.    Despite recent downgrades from four analysts, Wall Street remains optimistic about SMCI, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average SMCI price target from 11 analysts is $978.50, implying a potential upside of 119.69%. Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia is a standout technology concern and dominant in the AI field, which is why I rate the stock a Buy. The company\u2019s powerful chips are critical for advanced AI systems and data centers, and it controls about 98% of the data-center GPU market. This impressive market dominance, and positive earnings growth, reinforce my bullish stance on the stock.   Story Continues In the past 12 months, Nvidia\u2019s revenues have surged 194.7%, with earnings soaring 394.2%. Analysts expect the company to grow its revenue by 106.1% this year, reaching $125.58 billion, and anticipate a 119.2% increase in earnings per share (EPS). While Nvidia\u2019s recent second-quarter financial results exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations with 122% year-over-year sales growth and positive guidance, it fell short of the exceptionally high growth seen in previous quarters when sales rose more than 200% year-over-year.Is NVDA A Buy, Hold,\u00a0or\u00a0Sell?NVDA stock is definitely a Buy. It seems foolish to bet against this leading chipmaker, given the 140% gain in its share price this year. While recent results have raised concerns about slowing growth, I believe the long-term outlook for Nvidia remains strong.However, investors should expect some short-term volatility in Nvidia\u2019s stock due to its big run. Technical indicators show bearish trends in the short and medium term, though long-term indicators remain bullish. This suggests that, despite potential short-term weaknesses, long-term investors in Nvidia are likely to profit.  Wall Street remains extremely bullish on Nvidia. Among 42 analysts, 39 hold a Buy rating on the stock, with an average NVDA price target of $153.24, implying 31.08% upside from current levels.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)My Hold rating on AMD is due to the company\u2019s unimpressive financial growth. While the company posted a 6.4% increase in revenue and a 30.5% rise in earnings over the last 12 months, this growth pales in comparison to that of its main rival, Nvidia. This relative underperformance is driven by AMD\u2019s continued focus on hardware efficiency.Analysts forecast a nearly 13% increase in revenue for AMD this year, reaching $25.62 billion, along with a 27.6% rise in EPS. While the outlook is strong, AMD\u2019s recent results have been disappointing. Despite a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in the company\u2019s Data Center segment during Q2, AMD\u2019s revenue from chips and processors used in video game consoles fell by 59% to $648 million. In contrast, Nvidia\u2019s gaming revenues increased by 16% year-over-year. This performance gap suggests that AMD might not be the most attractive microchip designer to invest in right now.Is AMD a Buy, Hold, or Sell?Another reason I rate AMD stock a Hold is the company\u2019s recent $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems. This deal, financed with 75% cash and 25% stock, has raised concerns about potential share dilution, which could impact annual earnings. So far this year, AMD stock has risen less than 10%, trailing most of its peers and the technology-laden Nasdaq index, which has gained 20% year-to-date.In terms of momentum indicators, short-term signals are currently a Buy, while medium- and long-term indicators suggest a Sell. This implies that, while there may be short-term gains, long-term investors should exercise caution due to bearish sentiment.  On a positive note, Wall Street\u2019s consensus remains a Strong Buy for AMD stock. Of the 32 analysts covering AMD, 26 recommend a Buy, and the average price target of $190.25 indicates potential upside of 26.95%.Conclusion \u2013 NVDA Is the Best InvestmentWhile each company\u2014Super Micro Computer, Nvidia, and AMD\u2014has individual strengths, Nvidia currently offers the most compelling investment opportunity due to its dominance in AI and impressive growth. Super Micro Computer and AMD should be viewed with caution, given some underlying issues at each company. Assessing all three chip stocks, Nvidia holds a clear advantage in both performance and market outlook.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Chris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is \u201c a lot of momentum\u201d behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the \u201cwedge\u201d in the market. \u201cThe biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That\u2019s beginning to go away. It\u2019s almost to the fact that no one\u2019s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that\u2019s worrisome.\u201d  Hyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China \u201cjoining the party\u201d will be two key tailwinds for the market. Answering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes. \u201cWe have a lot of components of a soft landing. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,\u201d Hyzy added.  For this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.  Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares recently rose after a new report from Bain & Company said the AI-related hardware and software market is expected to grow between 40% and 55% annually, reaching between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Nvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.   Story Continues Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Of course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

Here's Morningstar's take on Nvidia's earnings and stock.\nNvidia reported strong results and gave investors a forecast for the October quarter ahead of our prior expectations and FactSet consensus estimates.\nIn the near term, we still assume the firm will increase its data center revenue by a few billion per quarter as additional GPU production capacity comes online. We're encouraged that leading cloud customers still plan to increase their AI investments.\nEven with Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell products arriving later this year, the firm saw no pause in purchases of its existing Hopper family of products. Blackwell is expected to represent $3 billion or more in revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter (ending January 2025).\nNvidia also expects data center revenue from sovereign governments will exceed $10 billion (\u00a37.6 billion) this year, up from a prior estimate of \"high single-digit billions\" announced last quarter. This revenue stream might be stickier in the long run, as it won't hinge on a government's ability to generate AI revenue.\nWe think the stock likely sold off in reaction to the earnings because Nvidia's forecast growth for the October quarter wasn't as eye-popping as in quarters past.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\n\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $105.00\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating: 3 stars\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High\n\nFair Value Estimate for Nvidia\nWith its 3-star rating, we believe Nvidia's stock is fairly valued compared to our long-term fair value estimate of $105 per share, which implies an equity value of roughly $2.5 trillion. Our fair value estimate implies a fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025, or effectively calendar 2024) price/adjusted earnings multiple of 37 times and a fiscal 2026 forward price/adjusted earnings multiple of 27 times.\nOur fair value estimate, and Nvidia's stock price, will be driven by its prospects in the data center and AI GPUs, for better or worse. Nvidia's DC business has achieved exponential growth already, rising from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in fiscal 2023 and more than tripling thereafter to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024. DC revenue appears to be supply-constrained, and we think that Nvidia will continue to steadily boost revenue in each of the four quarters in fiscal 2025 as more supply comes online. Based on Nvidia's strong forecast start for fiscal 2025, we model DC revenue rising 133% to $111 billion in fiscal 2025. We model a 23% compound annual growth rate for the three years thereafter, as we anticipate strong growth in capital expenditures in data centers at leading enterprise and cloud computing customers. We think it is reasonable that Nvidia may face an inventory correction or a pause in AI demand at some point in the medium term thereafter. Excluding this one-year blip that we model, we anticipate average annual DC growth of 10% thereafter and consider this to be a reasonable long-term growth rate as AI matures.\n\nEconomic Moat Rating\nWe assign Nvidia a wide moat, thanks to intangible assets around its graphics processing units and, increasingly, switching costs around its proprietary software, such as its Cuda platform for AI tools, which lets developers use the firm's GPUs to build AI models.\nNvidia was an early leader and designer of GPUs, originally developed to offload graphic processing tasks on PCs and gaming consoles. The firm has emerged as the clear market share leader in discrete GPUs (over 80% share, per Mercury Research). We attribute this leadership to intangible assets associated with GPU design, as well as the associated software, frameworks, and tools developers need to work with these GPUs. In our view, recent introductions like ray-tracing technology and the use of AI tensor cores in gaming applications are signs Nvidia has not lost its GPU leadership. A quick scan of GPU pricing in gaming and DC shows the firm's average selling prices can often be twice as high as its closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\nRead more about Nvidia's economic moat.\nFinancial Strength\nNvidia is in outstanding financial health. As of April 2024, the company held $31.4 billion in cash and investments, as compared with $9.7 billion in short-term and long-term debt. Semiconductor firms tend to hold large cash balances to help them navigate the cycles of the chip industry. During downturns, this provides them with a cushion and flexibility to continue investing in research and development, which is necessary to maintain their competitive and technology positions. Nvidia's dividend is virtually immaterial relative to its financial health and forward prospects, and most of the firm's distribution to shareholders comes in the form of stock buybacks.\nRead more about Nvidia's financial strength.\nRisk and Uncertainty\nWe assign Nvidia a Morningstar Uncertainty Rating of Very High. The firm is an industry leader in GPUs used in training AI models, and it has carved out a good portion of demand for chips used in AI inference workloads (which involves running a model to make a prediction or output).\nWe see many tech leaders vying for Nvidia's leading AI position. We think it is inevitable that leading hyper-scale vendors will seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia and diversify their semiconductor and software supplier base, including by developing in-house solutions. Among existing semiconductor vendors, AMD is quickly expanding its GPU lineup to serve these cloud leaders. Intel also has AI accelerator products today and will likely remain focused on this opportunity.\nRead more about Nvidia's risk and uncertainty.\nNVDA Bulls Say\nNvidia's GPUs offer industry-leading parallel processing, which was historically needed in PC gaming applications, but has expanded into crypto mining, AI, and perhaps future applications, too.\nNvidia's data center GPUs and Cuda software platform have established the company as the dominant vendor for AI model training, which is a use case that should rise exponentially in the years ahead.\nThe firm has a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving market that could lead to widespread adoption of its Drive PX self-driving platform.\nNVDA Bears Say\nNvidia is a leading AI chip vendor today, but other powerful chipmakers and tech titans are focused on in-house chip development.\nAlthough Cuda is currently a leader in AI training software and tools, leading cloud vendors would likely prefer to see greater competition in this space, and they may shift to any alternative open-source tools that arise.\nNvidia's gaming GPU business has often seen boom-or-bust cycles based on PC demand and, more recently, cryptocurrency mining.\nThis article was compiled by Renee Kaplan.\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletters\nSign up Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nNVIDIA\nTECHNOLOGY\nUS EQUITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

(NVDA): An Unstoppable AI Stock To Buy Now      Maham Fatima   September 9, 2024 7 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.08%          We recently compiled a list of the 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other unstoppable AI stocks. Is Predictive AI Taking Over GenAI? Generative AI is taking the world by storm. This groundbreaking technology is capable of creating new content, such as text, images, and even music, based on the patterns it learns from existing data. The impact of this advancement in AI on businesses has been profound, with businesses using it to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and generate innovative solutions through personalized content.  While there are still challenges, GenAI's potential is undeniable. AI companies have rolled out GenAI platforms, integrating large language models in them, that are a click away from the general public's access. We talked about this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Small Cap AI Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers. Here's an excerpt from it: \u201cLarge language models are a type of AI that uses deep learning techniques and massive datasets to understand, generate, and predict human language. They\u2019re trained for all of this through statistical relationships from vast amounts of text. The reason why they became so popular in such a short time is because they can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or understand language better through specific prompts. LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT-4 are Multimodal AI platforms that allow processing and generating multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text, audio, and visual inputs.\u201d  GenAI has been popular recently due to advancements that have brought us models like ChatGPT-4, but predictive AI (or enterprise machine learning) has been prevalent in the business world for a longer period. It's been used extensively for tasks like fraud detection, customer churn prediction, and market analysis. GenAI excels at creating new content, but predictive AI is better suited for tasks that involve forecasting future trends or predicting outcomes based on historical data. Mature organizations with streamlined processes use predictive AI as it helps deliver high returns and improve the customer experience. Forbes reported that UPS saves $35 million annually by optimizing package delivery planning. A medium-sized bank could save $16 million annually by predicting fraudulent transactions. A marketing campaign could increase profit 5x by predicting consumer behavior.  GenAI spending was less than 7% of predictive AI last year. However, predictive AI's potential remains largely untapped due to challenges in operationalization. It can operate autonomously, while GenAI often requires human oversight. It is also cheaper and has a smaller footprint than the latter. The global predictive AI market is expected to grow from $14.9 billion in 2023 to $108 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 21.9% from 2024 to 2033, according to a report published by market.us.   Story Continues Google AI's investment of $100 billion in responsible AI initiatives, focusing on areas like healthcare, climate change, and cybersecurity, indicates this sector's importance and potential. Similarly, SoftBank's $3.5 billion fund for predictive AI startups and Sequoia Capital's substantial investment in PreCog are also examples of this. In 2023, the Large Enterprises segment captured more than a 65% share in the Predictive AI market.Predictive AI is used for large-scale operations, learning from data to predict outcomes and behaviors, and guiding millions of daily operational decisions. Such use cases are further a testament to how artificial intelligence is now an integral part of major industries of the world, whether directly or indirectly.MethodologyTo compile our list, we sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of 15 AI stocks. We then selected the 7 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and had gained at least 30% year to date. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the year-to-date performance, as of September 4.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Management expects AI revenue to reach low-double-digit billions this year.Aoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year.

Overall NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the unstoppable AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines. \"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"  Jim Cramer: Tech Companies Flourish Despite Economic Concerns Jim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations. \"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut\u2014believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.    Story Continues Additionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic\u2014things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\" Cramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness\u2014a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\" Rising Stars: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Boosts Profits Even as Sales SlowFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.Our MethodologyThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179Jim Cramer shared that William Blair has also started coverage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a \"buy\" rating, highlighting the strong demand for the company's products. This reflects growing confidence in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s market position and potential for future growth.\"William Blair also initiated Nvidia with a buy, noting tremendous demand for its products.\" NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong outlook is supported by impressive Q2 2024 earnings, with revenue reaching $13.5 billion, a 50% increase from last year, and a net income of $5.6 billion. This growth is driven by high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.As a leader in the AI field, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPUs are essential for training machine learning models and powering AI solutions, positioning the company for continued growth as investment in AI infrastructure rises. The surge in data center revenue, particularly from cloud service providers, highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s commitment to high-performance computing solutions.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s innovative product lineup, including the H100 Tensor Core GPU designed for AI workloads, allows it to take advantage of rapid technological advancements. Strategic partnerships with major tech companies like Microsoft and Google further enhance NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s ecosystem and promote wider adoption of its products.With strong brand recognition and a solid market share in the GPU market, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from growth in gaming, AI, and data centers. Recent announcements of AI-related product enhancements and an optimistic revenue outlook suggest sustained demand, reinforcing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s potential for significant future growth.Overall NVDA ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

In the chart below we can see that since June, the Real Estate ETF\u00a0XLRE, Treasury ETF\u00a0TLT, Utilities ETF\u00a0XLU\u00a0and Healthcare\u00a0XLV\u00a0have outperformed both\u00a0SPY\u00a0and\u00a0QQQ\u00a0by a fairly significant margin.  As the Federal Reserve signals the start of a rate-cutting regime and broad economic indicators (employment, growth, inflation) point to a slowdown (not a recession), it's not surprising that some investors have shifted to more conservative holdings. However, now that tech stocks have been out of favor for nearly three months, many of the leading names, such as the Magnificent Seven stocks have traded to quite attractive levels. In this article, I\u2019ll highlight my top three picks moving forward\u2014Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA)\u2014along with key tactical trading levels to watch.   TradingView   Image Source: TradingView Apple: New iPhone and AI Innovations On Monday, Apple unveiled a new lineup of products, including the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Key features of the iPhone 16 series include enhanced camera capabilities, improved battery life, a new Action button for quick shortcuts and its new AI system called Apple Intelligence. \u00a0 The Apple Watch Series 10 boasts upgraded health tracking features and a redesigned case. AirPods 4 offer improved audio quality, active noise cancellation, and enhanced hearing health features. \u00a0  Apple has expanded its foray into health monitoring, with the AirPods now administering hearing tests and functioning as a 'clinical-grade' hearing aid. Additionally, the Apple Watch will now be able to monitor for sleep apnea by tracking breathing disturbances. \u00a0 Although critics often note the seemingly incremental improvements to these new Apple products, I find the health-monitoring functionalities especially compelling, while the new AI features could significantly improve usability. Apple stock has notably outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven stocks since May of this year, which is especially impressive considering the high volatility the market has experienced over the last three months.   TradingView   Image Source: TradingView Along with the relative strength of Apple stock, a more granular look at the price action shows a potential bull flag forming. If the broad market can hold up and AAPL breaks out above the $220 level, it should make an attempt at new all-time highs.   Story Continues Furthermore, the material integration of AI into the iPhone, the most widely used mobile device in the world sets up Apple to possibly ascend to AI leadership. At the least, if the AI narrative picks up again, Apple should be at the forefront.  TradingView  Image Source: TradingViewMeta Platforms: A Well Rounded and Promising Stock PickAlthough Meta Platforms seems to semi-regularly get caught up in frenzied controversy such as political scandals and misguided investments (Metaverse) the business continues to grow like crazy and spew profits. These manic cycles, although sometimes exhausting, have created numerous opportunities for savvy investors to pick up shares at a discount.Sales are expected to grow 19.8% this year and 13.9% next year, while earnings are projected to jump 43.6% this year and 12.7% next year. Analysts forecast earnings per share (EPS) to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years. Additionally, the stock is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 23.6x, which is inline with the market average and below its 10-year median valuation of 25x.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMeta Platforms isn\u2019t currently mixed up in any scandals and has rather been the second-best performing stock in the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023, bested only by Nvidia. But even with this incredible stock price appreciation, META remains among the cheapest of the group when comparing relative valuations thanks to equally impressive growth in EPS.  TradingView  Image Source: TradingViewThe price action in Meta Platforms\u2019 stock also paints a bullish picture. In addition to relative strength, META is building out a bull flag, nest within a broader consolidation. If the stock can break out above the $515 level, it should move into the upper range and beyond. Alternatively, if the stock loses the lower bound support of ~$465, the broader market is likely selling off, and it may be prudent to wait for another opportunity.  TradingView  Image Source: TradingViewNvidia: Cheapest Relative Valuation in YearsNvidia, the most exciting stock in the market over the last two years, has been struggling over the last three months. Between mid-June and early-August Nvidia staged a nasty correction, falling 35%. After rallying aggressively from the lows and testing the upper bound of the range, the shares have again sold off.Hovering now just above $100, I think investors have an opportunity to buy the stock near the bottom of the range. And not only has the stock come down to more reasonable levels, so has the Semiconductor manufacturer\u2019s valuation.  TradingView  Image Source: TradingViewToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 38x, which is below its 10-year media of 42.8x and close to the lowest it has been in the last five years. With EPS forecast to grow 41.7% annually over the next three to five years, Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 0.9, which is a discount based on the metric.If we look a little further into the future, Nvidia is trading at just 28x FY26 earnings. If growth remains as high as projected, Nvidia stock should continue to appreciate strongly.Should Investors Buy Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Apple Stock?Given the current market conditions, a shift towards defensive sectors has created attractive buying opportunities among the tech leaders, particularly the Magnificent Seven. Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have all experienced pullbacks in recent months, presenting investors with entry points at more reasonable valuations.Apple, with its latest product releases and AI innovations, continues to show resilience and leadership, while Meta Platforms, despite past controversies, is experiencing tremendous growth and remains undervalued compared to its peers. Nvidia, despite its recent correction, offers high growth potential and is trading at its most attractive valuation in years.For long-term investors, these stocks offer a blend of stability, innovation, and growth. Apple\u2019s steady outperformance, Meta\u2019s explosive earnings growth, and Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI and semiconductor technology make these three companies well-positioned for the next market uptrend. With their recent pullbacks, now may be the time to capitalize on their future potential before the market shifts back in favor of tech.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock. Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 9.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.  Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +85%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.7%. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.81 points to a change of +116.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.8%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +32.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.7%. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   Story Continues The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $32.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +79.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $124.17 billion and $170.63 billion estimates indicate +103.8% and +37.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Chip stocks are back in fashion.  Nvidia in the red for the quarter.  Illustration by TradingViewChip maker\u2019s valuation has been zig-zagging this quarter and is on track to clock out of it at a loss. Nvidia stock NVDA was leading the semiconductor sector higher on Wednesday as investors scooped up shares of battered AI plays. The chip giant added a solid 8% to its valuation, clocking out for the day at $116.91 a share. Nvidia is having a good week \u2014 its stock is up more than 10% since Monday and has pared back about half of its last-week losses when it washed out $406 billion from its market cap \u2014 a record for any public company.  The main character in artificial intelligence helped buoy its peers. Semiconductor companies saw elevated interest from money managers after a bruising time knocked valuations across the board. Micron MU and Intel INTC rose 4.4% and 3.5%, respectively. Still, the lofty price tags of chip companies remain a red flag to traders who see more stock froth than actual sane valuations.  Nvidia\u2019s volatility puts it in the meme stock corner despite its gargantuan size that eclipses $3 trillion (depending on the day). The Jensen Huang-led tech juggernaut is flaunting year-to-date gains of more than 140% but has been seriously zig-zagging its way through the third quarter. After a few deep dives and high rises, Nvidia is showing a 6% loss for the three months to September, on track to wrap up the quarter in the red.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.  We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  Step By Step Through The Calculation We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate  2025202620272028202920302031203220332034  Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$60.1bUS$82.5bUS$102.7bUS$119.1bUS$131.4bUS$141.8bUS$150.8bUS$158.6bUS$165.5bUS$171.9b Growth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x15Analyst x9Analyst x2Est @ 10.30%Est @ 7.96%Est @ 6.32%Est @ 5.18%Est @ 4.37%Est @ 3.81%  Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$55.8kUS$70.9kUS$81.8kUS$87.9kUS$89.9kUS$90.0kUS$88.7kUS$86.5kUS$83.6kUS$80.5k  (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$815b   Story Continues After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$172b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (7.9%\u2013 2.5%) = US$3.3tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$1.5tThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.3t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$103, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.  NasdaqGS:NVDA Discounted Cash Flow September 9th 2024  The AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.306. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NVIDIAStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market. OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio. ThreatNo apparent threats visible for NVDA. Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For NVIDIA, we've compiled three important elements you should look at:Risks: Be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those doesn't sit too well with us...

AI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.

AI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.  Tom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.

The stock has ticked upwards in the past few days after a prolonged downward slide following the release of earnings that were overshadowed by slow growth and production delays to the latest Blackwell chips. However, recent remarks by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, in which he said that the new chips were in full production and the firm expected to start shipping them in the fourth quarter and ramp up from there. The start of Blackwell shipping would translate to around $10 billion in revenue for the chip firm, according to chip analysts.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

The biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.  The 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 12.9% below. Stocks, especially growth stocks with cash flows further into the future, had a good end of 2023. On the other hand, this year has seen more volatile stock market swings due to mixed inflation data, and processors and graphics chips stocks have had a rough stretch. On average, share prices are down 7.5% since the latest earnings results. Best Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.

Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates. \u201cHopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.   Nvidia Total Revenue   Nvidia achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street\u2019s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts\u2019 consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 6.7% since reporting and currently trades at $117.28. Read why we think that Nvidia is one of the best processors and graphics chips stocks, our full report is free.

Why Nvidia stock could soar much higher?\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is making headlines after a significant sale of his company's stock. Over the past few months, Huang has cashed in about $713 million worth of Nvidia shares. This move comes as part of his plan to sell 6 million shares by March 2025 - a goal he's reached earlier than expected. CEO Jensen Huang is done selling sharesJensen Huang, the diligent CEO known for his iconic black leather jacket, has sold a substantial portion of his personal stake in Nvidia (NVDA). From June 14 to September 13, Huang completed the sale of six million shares of the chipmaker, earning a total of $713 million. Nvidia stock has surged by approximately 3,000% over the past five years, making Huang's payout all the more rewarding.Huang has reached the maximum limit of 6 million shares he is allowed to sell under a prearranged plan implemented in March. This trading plan, known as a 10b5-1 plan, allows company insiders to trade a firm's stock according to a predetermined schedule, ensuring compliance with insider trading regulations.Huang remains the company's largest Nvidia shareholder. According to an SEC filing from September 18th, the executive holds over 75 million worth of Nvidia common stock; that's aside from another 785 million held through various trusts and partnerships. Nvidia stock closed 4% higher The average price of the stock sale is $118.93 a share \u2014 some shares were sold for as low as $91.72 and as high as $140.24. The chief exec now holds 75.4 million shares in his personal account, according to the Form 4 he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More than that, he owns 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships and his net worth is estimated to be $106 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.The stock has rallied 150% year-to-date. Nvidia has become a Wall Street favorite in recent years, as that its semiconductor hardware has become a core component of the artificial intelligence boom.Nvidia\u2019s AI chip business is booming, its top customers include other big tech names, such as Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. Why Nvidia stock could soar much higher?Phil Panaro \u2014 a former senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group who also served as CEO of a BCG subsidiary \u2014 says shares of the AI chipmaker will reach $800 by 2030. That implies another 545% upside for the stock, which traded around $122 a share mid-day Friday.\"Nvidia powers all of the accelerated computing, to make that happen, so they're going to have a major share of that,\" Panaro said in an interview with Schwab Network on Thursday. He later estimated that the firm's revenue could scale by a factor of 10, from $60 billion in the last fiscal year to $600 billion by 2030.Panaro's prediction leans on the extreme end of forecasters, but Wall Street is generally feeling bullish about the chipmaker's stock, which has climbed 152% since the start of the year. Analysts have issued an average price target of $152 a share for the stock, according to Nasdaq data, implying around 25% upside from current levels.

As the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.  The latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise. Chris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky. \"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"  In contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance. Feroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.   Story Continues \"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\" However, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.Additionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.In another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\" As political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\" Our MethodologyIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential.

Tech Stocks Shine When Rates Are High but Struggle After Rate Cuts, Says Cramer In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer points out that tech stocks often perform well when the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates and the economy slows down. However, when the Fed cuts rates, as it did recently, Wall Street shifts its focus to companies that can show significant earnings growth due to these lower rates. This may seem confusing, but in the stock market, cash is limited, and it's currently flowing into companies that would struggle without the rate cuts. While many stocks initially rose after the cut, they couldn't maintain those gains, leading to a market decline. \"The thing is, these tech stocks tend to be winners when the Fed keeps rates high and the economy slows. But when the Fed slams on the accelerator, as it did today, Wall Street bands together and piles into the companies that can post big earnings gains with much lower interest rates. Now, that may sound strange to you. Obviously, the real world makes no distinction between a company that does well all the time and one that does extremely well some of the time.  Cramer questions whether all tech stocks are now weaker and suggests that not every company will suffer the same fate. He believes there are still standout stocks in the tech sector that can thrive regardless of economic conditions, even if they don\u2019t perform well on days when the market dips. These companies help larger businesses operate more efficiently, and there's always a demand for that kind of support, indicating that some tech players will continue to shine. \"So, is every player doomed to the same small part? Are the stocks of all tech companies weaker now? Can nothing transcend that status? Like when I went out for Bye Bye Birdie or Guys and Dolls in high school, I mean, first, no publicly traded company would ever be that low. I was totally expendable, other than as Lieutenant Rooney in ARS Gold Lace, where I don't think I ever spoke more than a few words.    Story Continues Jim Cramer: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Drives Profit Growth Despite Slowing SalesJim Cramer also highlights that artificial intelligence is a crucial factor in today's market. Companies using AI can enhance their profit margins, increasing earnings even amid declining sales. This indicates that AI can drive profitability without needing to boost sales.Our MethodologyThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

He noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has already achieved significant breakthroughs in this field, showcasing its innovative capabilities.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong outlook is backed by its impressive Q2 2024 earnings, which exceeded analyst expectations and showed record revenue growth due to high demand for its GPUs in data centers and AI applications. As a leader in AI hardware and software,NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are essential for training and running AI models, positioning the company for ongoing growth as AI adoption increases across industries.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also enhancing its product offerings with innovations like the Hopper and Grace architectures, which improve performance for AI and high-performance computing tasks. Strategic partnerships with major tech companies help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expand its influence in areas such as autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and gaming.With rising investments in AI and machine learning, analysts have raised their price targets for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting positive expectations for its growth. Recent announcements about major contracts and advancements in AI technology have further boosted investor confidence, creating a strong bullish outlook for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the stocks that could change your investment game according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Affan Mir   October 1, 2024 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.19%       We recently published a list of the 7 Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts. The Fed recently cut the funds rate by 50 basis points which has been considered a bold move by some analysts while others and most of the market have welcomed it with open arms. Moreover, over 50% of interest rate traders expect another 50 bps cut in the next meeting as well, according to the CME Fed-watch tool. While the Fed\u2019s move might seem risky, the broader market is up over 2.5% since the cuts, as of September 27. Jeremy Siegel on the Fed\u2019s Bold Move In an interview with CNBC Squawk Box on September 19, Professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School expressed his strong approval of the Fed\u2019s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He called it the best news from the Fed in years. Professor Siegel believes that this move will lead to a significant rise in the stock market and pointed out that the Fed is now addressing the gap between current rates and what he considers the \u201cnew neutral\u201d Fed funds rate of 2.9%.  He said that the Fed has shifted from expecting only one rate cut by the year\u2019s end to anticipating four cuts in total, with the market reflecting expectations of a gradual approach to future cuts. When asked about concerns from former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson, who warned that the market might be overreacting to the cuts, Siegel said that smaller, consistent rate decreases would be enough. He suggested that if inflation remains low, the Fed could implement 25 basis point cuts in the upcoming meetings, ultimately reducing rates to around 3.3% to 3.5%. He said with confidence that inflation would not rise significantly, as he referenced the market indicators suggesting it could fall below 2% next year. In a discussion about economic policies from the presidential candidates, Professor Siegel critiqued both sides as extreme and said that their policies are unlikely to be implemented. He said that there would be a divided government that would limit any drastic changes. He stressed that while some policies might be proposed, actual governance would lead to compromises rather than sweeping reforms. Historical Insights on Rate Cuts and Stock Returns According to data from Ned Davis Research, historical trends indicate that stocks tend to perform favorably in the year following the initial interest rate cut. According to the data, the broader market has recorded an average increase of around 12% in the first six months and 15% in the first twelve.   Story Continues Despite the generally positive outlook for stocks following interest rate cuts, there were exceptions in 2001 and 2007, when the broader market saw declines of 12.4% and 22.2%, respectively, in the year following the Fed\u2019s actions. This shows that historical average performance does not guarantee that rate cuts will always yield favorable outcomes.However, looking at the last ten rate cut cycles since 1974, the market has risen in eight of those instances, with four cycles resulting in gains of over 20%. Additionally, after the 1974 cut cycle, the market reached a remarkable 40% increase.Our MethodologyFor this article, we used stock screeners to compile a list of over 30 stocks with 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 30% or above.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) One of the Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) One of the Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Average Price Target Upside: 23.56%5-Year Revenue CAGR: 56.73%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Established in 1993, the company initially carved out a niche with its pioneering graphics processing units (GPUs), which excel at handling multiple tasks simultaneously.The innovation has made it a critical player not only in the gaming industry but also in sectors such as professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. The company operates through two main segments, Graphics and Compute & Networking.The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs and the GeForce NOW game streaming service, while the Compute & Networking segment features data center platforms and advanced AI software.Its stock has received a consensus Strong Buy rating from 64 analysts. As of September 27, the average price target of $150.00 has an upside of 23.56% from current levels. It ranks 5th on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts.In 2023, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) captured an impressive 94% market share in AI server sales as per Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh\u2019s estimates, which reinforces its dominance in the rapidly growing AI GPU market.The company\u2019s data center revenue has surged at a rate significantly outpacing that of competitors, which show a strong demand for its products. Customers are actively seeking NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper AI GPUs, which are expected to be succeeded by the next-generation Blackwell chips. The demand for these upcoming processors is projected to surpass supply through 2025, which is a sign of a strong pipeline for future revenue.Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best data center stocks. In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, data centers have emerged as the unsung heroes that underpin our digital world. These critical infrastructures are not just the backbone of the internet; they are the engine driving the exponential growth of data, cloud computing, and advanced digital services. The data center industry is on a trajectory of significant expansion, with the market size projected to reach an impressive $418 billion by 2030, according to estimates from IndustryARC. This represents a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2030. This remarkable growth is fueled by a combination of factors that are reshaping the data center landscape, making it a crucial sector for both technological advancement and investment opportunities.  At the heart of this growth is the increasing demand for hyper-scalability, sustainability, and automation in data centers. In today\u2019s digital age, businesses and organizations require data centers that can scale rapidly to accommodate ever-increasing data volumes, support advanced technological applications, and provide reliable and efficient services. Hyper-scalability, which refers to the ability of data centers to scale up their resources rapidly and efficiently, is becoming a vital requirement as data usage continues to surge. This demand for scalability is driven by the rise of cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), all of which require robust and flexible data center solutions. Sustainability is another critical factor influencing the data center market. As environmental concerns become more prominent, there is a growing emphasis on creating data centers that are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Green data centers, which focus on reducing energy consumption and minimizing environmental impact, are gaining traction as both businesses and consumers become more eco-conscious. The Department of Energy highlights that data centers account for approximately 2% of all electricity used in the U.S., underscoring the need for more sustainable practices in the industry. Automation is also playing a significant role in transforming data centers.  Modern data centers are increasingly adopting automation technologies to enhance operational efficiency, reduce human error, and streamline processes. Automation in data centers includes everything from automated cooling systems to intelligent data management solutions, all of which contribute to more efficient and reliable operations. The market dynamics of data centers are further influenced by the adoption of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), cloud computing, and edge computing.   Story Continues AI and ML are revolutionizing data center management by enabling predictive maintenance, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing overall performance. For instance, AI-driven systems can analyze data center operations in real-time, identify potential issues before they become critical, and automate corrective actions. This proactive approach not only improves operational efficiency but also extends the lifespan of data center equipment.Cloud computing has become a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure, and its growth is driving increased demand for data centers. As businesses and individuals continue to shift towards cloud-based services, the need for data centers that can support these services is growing. Cloud computing allows for the storage and processing of vast amounts of data in remote data centers, providing flexibility and scalability that traditional on-premise solutions cannot match.Edge computing is another transformative technology impacting the data center industry. Edge computing brings data processing closer to the source of data generation, reducing latency and improving the performance of applications that require real-time data processing. This shift towards edge computing is driving the development of smaller, geographically distributed data centers that can support the growing demand for low-latency applications and services.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the data center industry cannot be understated. The pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of businesses and highlighted the critical role of data centers in supporting remote work, online services, and increased internet traffic. With fewer people out in public during the pandemic, global internet traffic surged as more people worked and engaged online from home. This increase in demand led to a 30-35% rise in data center capacity in 2021, as organizations sought to support remote work and ensure the continuity of their operations.The pandemic also underscored the importance of data centers in maintaining business operations and delivering essential services. Data centers became the backbone of remote work, online education, telemedicine, and other critical services that became indispensable during the pandemic. As a result, the data center market experienced accelerated growth, and this trend is expected to continue as businesses and individuals increasingly rely on digital solutions.Geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis, have also impacted the data center industry. The ongoing conflict has led many companies to reassess their operations in the region, with some choosing to suspend or withdraw their services. For example, SAP SE announced in March 2022 that it would halt sales of new products in Russia and shut down all data centers in the country. This situation highlights the need for data center operators to have resilient and adaptable strategies to navigate geopolitical uncertainties.Regionally, North America remains a dominant force in the data center market, holding a substantial market share. The region\u2019s dominance is attributed to significant investments by major players and the high adoption of advanced technologies. In 2021, North America saw the launch or construction of over 100 data center projects, with major colocation service providers and hyper-scale operators leading the way.The IT infrastructure segment holds the largest market share within the data center industry. This segment encompasses the hardware, software, and network components required to support data center operations. As businesses continue to migrate towards data center solutions for improved data management and operational efficiency, the demand for IT infrastructure is expected to grow. This growth is further fueled by the increasing adoption of automation and enhanced storage solutions.Hyper-scale data centers are another significant segment within the industry. These data centers are designed to handle massive volumes of data and high computing power requirements. The rise in IoT-connected devices and the growing emphasis on processing large volumes of digital data are driving the demand for hyper-scale data centers. These facilities are equipped to support the high-performance needs of modern applications and services.The emergence of green data centers represents a positive shift towards sustainability in the industry. Green data centers focus on reducing energy consumption and minimizing environmental impact. As businesses and consumers become more environmentally conscious, the demand for green data centers is expected to increase. This trend aligns with broader efforts to promote sustainability and address climate change.Data security remains a critical concern for data centers, especially those handling sensitive information. According to industry reports, a significant percentage of corporate data centers worry about data security. Ensuring robust security measures is essential for protecting data and maintaining trust with clients and customers. The data center industry is undergoing a period of rapid growth and transformation, driven by technological advancements, increased demand for digital services, and a focus on sustainability.As the digital landscape continues to evolve, data centers will play a crucial role in supporting the infrastructure needed for modern technology and services. The market\u2019s growth is fueled by factors such as hyper-scalability, automation, and the adoption of advanced technologies, while challenges like data security and geopolitical uncertainties also shape the industry\u2019s future.For investors, the data center sector presents a promising opportunity, with the potential for significant returns as the industry continues to expand. Understanding the dynamics of the data center market, including the key trends and challenges, will be essential for making informed investment decisions and capitalizing on the growth of this critical sector.

The latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.  Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Another major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of\u00a0 AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Famous data storage firm NetApp recently announced that it had used NVIDIA AI software and accelerated computing hardware to come up with an advanced generative AI data vision and end-to-end integrated solution. The product, which uses intelligent data infrastructure for enterprise retrieval augmented generation, marketed by NetApp, will bring new capabilities to the NetApp unified storage operating system that can leverage a new NetApp global metadata namespace to unify data stores for the tens of thousands of enterprises that use NetApp for their data infrastructure.Latest reports published by American magazine Barron\u2019s indicate that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has completed a trading plan adopted earlier in the year. Huang grossed $713 million through stock sales executed by his Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, at an average price of over $118 per share, according to the magazine. The plan was set to be effective through March 2025, but it sold all of the allotted shares six months before expiration, the report claimed. Huang could adopt another plan to sell more shares, it added.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Maleha Afzal   September 21, 2024 5 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.18%       We recently compiled a list of the Best Future Stocks For The Long-Term. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the best future stocks for the long term. A Soft Landing is More than Likely The Fed plans to initiate rate cuts for the first time in over four years and investors do not know what to expect of the financial markets moving forward. On September 17, Stephen Juneau, Bank of America US economist, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the impact of an unexpected growth in consumer spending on the economy.  Juneau reiterated that economic data is highly volatile and that the retail data released this morning will not impact the Fed\u2019s rate cut decision tomorrow, and he expects the Fed to stick to a 25-basis point cut. As for consumer behavior, the economy is finally moving toward normalization and the consumer\u2019s basket of goods reflects that. These indications, the increasing labor demand, and a stable investment outlook hint that a hard landing is highly unlikely. The Outlook of Investing Amid Rate Cuts On September 17, Eric Freedman, US Bank Asset Management Group CIO, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the rate cut and how investors view investing. Freedman said that the rate cut depends on the Fed\u2019s path, therefore an accurate prediction may not be possible at the moment. Freedman talks about investment from an individual perspective, suggesting investors must move out of the front end of the yield curve. He then pointed to sectors that are currently providing value to investors, including the consumer discretionary sector, some parts of the energy sector, and tech, especially because investments in the sector are predicted to grow rapidly, well into 2025.  He then discussed what companies need to do to attract investors. Freedman emphasized the need for strong financials and suggested that companies should engage in buybacks or consider increasing dividends. The perfect combination of stocks, according to Freedman, includes companies that are returning cash and seeing strong organic growth. The future of the economy and the financial market is quite unpredictable. However, some stocks can influence the market not just now, but also in the future. With that, let\u2019s take a look at the best future stocks for the long term. Our Methodology\u00a0 To come up with the 10 best future stocks for the long term we looked up growth stocks in the AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Biotechnology, Electric Vehicle, and Renewable Energy industries. We then ranked the stocks with the highest number of hedge funds as of Q2 2024.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.The company logged $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 2.5x and networking revenue expanded by 2x compared to the previous year. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the best future stocks for the long term. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company\u2019s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Nvidia\u2019s position in the market is solid and explains why it is referred to as the AI star.Analysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 30% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin\u2019s\u00a0Citadel Investment Group\u00a0was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.35 billion.Ithaka Group\u2019s\u00a0Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best future stocks for the long-term. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Zarah Hamid   September 12, 2024 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.17%          We recently compiled a list of the 20 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other cryptocurrency stocks. A Review of the Crypto World: Latest Updates Crypto has emerged as a major political issue in the US with the campaigns for election going on. Head of Firmwide research Galaxy Digital Alex Thorn called August a rough and seasonally bad week for Bitcoin. He mentioned how eight out of the eleven prior Augusts witnessed the major coin trading down. However, political events have also played a role in the crypto landscape.  In Thorn's opinion, most people view Trump\u2019s victory as bullish for the crypto market. Trump who is now running for President brought the hopes of the crypto world higher by promising to deliver a plan to make the United States the \u2018crypto capital of the planet\u2019. Crypto became an even hotter topic as Kamala Haris simultaneously supported policies for the expansion of the industry. In the opinion of Thorn, most people view Trump\u2019s victory as bullish for the crypto market. He predicts crypto will run quite higher if Trump ends up winning the election based on an anticipated easing of the regulations. On the other hand, he expects the victory of Harris to be more neutral even for the industry since those advising her belong to the Biden administration on crypto policy. Looking forward to September which is a seasonally weak month for crypto too, the next months including October, November, and December are crypto's most bullish months based on the seasonality factor. Regardless of the highly awaited Fed interest rate cuts just ahead of us, the crypto market investors still remain concerned as JPMorgan\u2019s Head of Global and European Equity Strategy dismissed the potential of a crypto bull market. While September has been a historically worst month for US stocks, the upcoming rate cut might be an outlier in history.  In an interview with CNBC, Anthony Pompliano, Professional Capital Management CEO, talked about the recent price moves in Bitcoin. The German government offloading Bitcoin through as many exchanges and the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox unloading coins onto the market are two important events defining this supply. Pompliano refers to Bitcoin as really illiquid with many Bitcoin holders having a long-term view of it. At the start of 2024, the Bitcoin amount that had not moved in more than a year was over 70%. Some of it started to get distributed as prices rose, as expected in a bull market. Although Pompliano expects this percentage to drop to 50% to 55% but still at least half of the Bitcoin would still be in the hands of people who have an over 10-year time horizon. Thus, the question revolves around whether these hands are strong enough to outlast the aforementioned two events. Pompliano finally states time as the only catalyst for Bitcoin rather than a pro-crypto candidate in the upcoming US elections. While the summer season is a bit slow, prices typically go back up in September and beyond.   Story Continues Our Methodology:In order to compile a list of the 20 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a preliminary list of 40 companies involved in the crypto space. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 20 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 20 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders they have, as of Q2 2024.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializes in products and platforms for the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets. The chip maker is known for its GPU technology which is utilized in crypto mining and makes it an important company in the crypto space.The recent development from NVIDIA made the firm outshine as it unveiled the Blackwell GPU architecture at NVIDIA GTC 2024. Blackwell is the largest GPU ever built with 208 billion transistors which is more than 2.5 times the amount of transistors in NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, thereby unlocking a new era of accelerated computing and generative AI. While customers are currently gearing up to adopt Blackwell which has been widely sampled, the firm expects to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in Q4.For the second quarter ended July 28, NVIDIA reported a record quarterly revenue of $30 billion, up 122% year-over-year, and well above the firm\u2019s outlook of $28 billion. Data Center revenue was also at a record $26.3 billion, increasing by 154% as compared to the prior year. This increase was attributable to the strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and its networking platforms. Simultaneously, compute revenue increased by more than 2.5 times and networking revenue rose by more than 2 times relative to 2023.The company also expects its sovereign AI revenue to hit low-double-digit billions this year, fueled by AI-powered chatbots and generative AI copilots. It is working with many Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across geographies and industries. An example of this is SAP using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. During the recent quarter, the company made a major stride in enterprise AI by introducing a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1.According to Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is held by 179 hedge funds, compared to 186 funds in the prior quarter. Citadel Investment Group is the dominant shareholder in the company with a position worth $18 billion.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

And the results we\u2019ve received from several companies have helped confirm the positivity surrounding the theme, further exciting investors. Thankfully, there are several angles investors can use to obtain exposure, such as Nvidia NVDA for the hardware side, Vertiv VRT for data center services, and Palantir PLTR for the software angle. \u00a0Let\u2019s take a closer look at each. NVDA Remains Clear AI Favorite Nvidia shares have finally taken a breather over the last three months, essentially flat compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 4% gain. Shares didn\u2019t see a melt-up following its latest release like previously, though results were again remarkable. The company maintains a notably bright outlook across the board, undoubtedly constructive for share performance moving forward despite the recent sideways action. Remember that NVDA is one of the \u2018late\u2019 reporters during earnings season, with its next release scheduled for November 19th.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Concerning its latest quarterly release, the AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting an impressive 122% year-over-year climb. As usual, Data Center results reflected the main event, with a quarterly sales record of $26.3 billion up 150% on a year-over-year stack. And despite its strong run, the valuation picture here remains attractive, with the current 36.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple comparing favorably to the 50.7X five-year median. The current PEG works out to 0.8X, reflective of both growth and value.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Vertiv Keeps Data Centers Cool Vertiv provides services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial facilities with a portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services. The outlook for its current fiscal year continues to be rosy, with the $2.59 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 32% over the last year and suggesting 45% Y/Y growth.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company\u2019s latest set of results came in strong, with VRT enjoying 57% year-over-year growth in organic orders alongside a 13% sales increase. Due to the momentum it's currently enjoying, Vertiv upped its current year sales, operating profit, and adjusted free cash flow outlook following the print. Below is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company has continued to see increasing scaling of AI deployment, also boasting the capacity needed to capture the massive opportunity.   Story Continues Palantir Sees Customer MomentumPalantir builds software that empowers organizations toeffectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations. The stock maintains a bullish outlook across the board, with analysts revising their earnings expectations well higher over recent months.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIts latest quarterly release brought post-earnings positivity, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations while also lifting its current-year sales outlook. Revenue soared 27% year-over-year, whereas adjusted EPS climbed 200%.The company\u2019s platform continues to be highly attractive, reflected by 41% year-over-year customer growth. Impressively, PLTR closed over 27 deals worth $10 million throughout the period, further reflecting snowballing demand.\u2018Our growth across the commercial and government markets has been driven by an unrelenting wave of demand from customers for artificial intelligence systems that go beyond the merely performative and academic,\u2019 said Alexander Carp, CEO, in a letter to shareholders.The company\u2019s top line has remained notably strong, as shown below.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe artificial intelligence (AI) theme continues to grip investors, causing many to seek exposure.Investors can play the trade through several angles, including Nvidia NVDA for the hardware side, Vertiv VRT for data center services, and Palantir PLTR for the software angle.

Zacks Equity Research   September 27, 2024 7 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. NVIDIA Q2 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates NVIDIA reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2025. The chip maker reported non-GAAP earnings of 68 cents per share for the aforementioned quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.3%. The reported figure soared 152% year over year while increasing 11% sequentially. Higher revenues, as well as improvement in gross margin and operating margin, drove the robust increase in earnings.  Fiscal second-quarter revenues climbed 122% and increased 15% sequentially to $30.04 billion. The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and higher sales across the Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive end markets. The top line also beat the consensus mark of $28.42 billion. NVIDIA Segment Details NVIDIA reports revenues under two segments \u2014 Graphics and Compute & Networking. Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing as well as automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Graphics accounted for 12% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment\u2019s top line soared 16% year over year while increasing 7% sequentially to $3.59 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimates for the Graphics segment was pegged at $3.81 billion.  Compute & Networking represented 88% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment comprises the Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics as well as other embedded platforms. Compute & Networking revenues soared 154% year over year and 17% sequentially to $26.45 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this segment was pegged at $24.33 billion. NVIDIA Market Platform Top-Line Details Based on the market platform, revenues from Data Center (87.4% of revenues) jumped 154% year over year and 16% from the previous quarter to $26.27 billion. This robust rise was mainly driven by higher shipments of the Hopper GPU computing platform that is used for the training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Our estimate for this end-market\u2019s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $24.51 billion.   Story Continues NVIDIA witnessed strong demand for its chips used in the Data Center by all customers in both compute and networking markets. During the fiscal second quarter, large cloud providers represented 45% of Data Center revenues while the remaining stemmed from consumer internet and enterprise companies.Gaming revenues increased 16% year over year and 9% sequentially at $2.88 billion, accounting for 9.6% of the total revenues. The year-over-year surge reflects increased sales of its GeForce RTX 40 series family of GPUs (graphics processing units) and game console system-on-chips. Our estimate for the Gaming end-market\u2019s second-quarter revenues was pegged at $2.77 billion.Professional Visualization revenues (1.5% of revenues) increased 20% year over year and 6% sequentially to $454 million. The increase was primarily driven by the ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on the Ada architecture. Our estimate for the Professional Visualization end-market\u2019s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $475.7 million.Automotive sales (1.2% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $346 million, up 37% on a year-over-year basis and 5% sequentially. The increase was mainly driven by AI cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms.\u00a0 OEM and Other revenues (0.3% of revenues) were up 33% year over year and 13% sequentially to $88 million. Our estimate for the Automotive and OEM end markets\u2019 fiscal second-quarter revenues were pegged at $294.6 million and $86.4 million, respectively.NVDA Operating DetailsNVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 75.7% from 71.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher Data Center sales and benefits from favorable component costs. However, non-GAAP gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within the Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 52% year over year and 12% sequentially to $2.21 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits. However, as a percentage of total revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 9.3% from 13.6% in the year-ago quarter and 9.6% in the previous quarter.The non-GAAP operating income jumped 156% year over year and 10% sequentially to $19.94 billion, driven by higher revenues. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 880 bps to 66.4% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s 57.6% due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, non-GAAP operating income contracted 290 bps due to a reduction in gross margin partially offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.NVIDIA\u2019s non-GAAP net income margin of 56.4% for the second quarter improved 650 bps year over year but contracted 210 bps sequentially. This was the first time the company witnessed a sequential contraction in net income margin following eight quarters of improvement.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of July 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $34.8 billion, up from $31.44 billion as of April 28. As of July 28, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, unchanged sequentially.NVIDIA generated $14.5 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $6.3 billion but down from the previous quarter\u2019s $15.3 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2025, it generated an operating cash flow of $29.8 billion. NVIDIA generated a free cash flow of $13.48 billion in the second quarter and $28.42 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025.In the fiscal second quarter, the company returned $246 million to shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $7.16 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2025, the company paid out $344 million in dividends and bought back stocks worth $14.9 billion.At the end of the second quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of approximately $7.5 billion. The board of directors recently approved a new $50 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $57.5 billion, which has no expiration time.NVDA Third-Quarter GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $32.5 billion (+/-2%). The non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 75% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3 billion.NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell UpdateDuring its second-quarter earnings conference call, NVIDIA revealed that it has executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield and has shipped the same in the second quarter. It is expected to start ramping up the production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and continue through fiscal 2026.Earlier, NVIDIA stated that the ramp-up of Blackwell production will begin in 2024. However, the latest update signals that the production ramp-up could now start by the end of January 2025.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 7.26% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Nvidia has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Nvidia has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.  Some sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.

Hedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.  Similarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.

These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has been in the spotlight over the past few days after topping analyst expectations on earnings and guidance in the latest quarterly report. This outperformance, coming in the wake of investor concerns around the production ramp for the latest AI chip named Blackwell, outlines the solid demand for non-Blackwell chips that the company markets, the most notable of which is Hopper. Wall Street analysts reiterated their bullish forecasts for the chipmaker following the earnings report, with Daniel Ives from Wedbush leading this charge.Ives hailed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the torch bearer of the AI revolution, with the results and guidance a drop-the-mic moment. Ives, who has been particularly bullish on the company in the past few months, underlined that AI GPU demand was way outstripping supply for NVIDIA at this juncture, and Wall Street should view these results as a very bullish indicator for the broader tech sector with more shock and awe rather than a shrug of the shoulders.Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

[+] campus in Silicon Valley; the NVIDIA logo and symbol displayed on the facadegetty\nWhile everyone else was cheering Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) stock back to new heights this week, I called the top for the stock first thing Monday (August 26th) morning on Chuck Jaffe\u2019s MoneyLife show.\n\n\nIn this letter, I am going to show you my secret weapon for calling the top in NVDA, the most important stock in the market. My secret weapon works for other stocks, too. I\u2019m going to show you how to use it to call the top for another very popular stock.\n\nI\u2019m not guaranteeing that either stock won\u2019t go back up like a crazy meme stock. These days anything is possible. But, I went out on a limb to say I think NVDA is headed down, way down for two reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity is drying up\nMy secret weapon raised red flags.\n\n\nI needed to see liquidity dry up before I could apply my secret weapon. As one of my favorite hedge fund clients told me many years ago, the \u201conly thing that causes a bubble to pop is a liquidity pinch.\u201d And, that\u2019s exactly what we saw on August 5th.\nFigure 1: NVDA Price MovementsNVDA Price MovementNew Constructs, LLC and Google Finance\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nWhen I saw how much that liquidity pinch affected NVDA, I, along with many other folks, noted that much of the money pouring into NVDA was leveraged capital from the yen carry trade. Lots of investors were shorting the yen and putting that money into NVDA. In other words, investors were \u201cspeculating\u201d not \u201cinvesting\u201d in NVDA, they were looking to make a quick buck with cheap capital.\n\nNext, I needed to be sure that the liquidity pinch would continue and that neither the U.S. Federal Reserve nor the Bank of Japan were going to pull strings to re-ignite the yen carry trade. When they did not, I knew it was time to pull out my secret weapon for finding the most overvalued stocks in the market.\n\n\nI first learned how to use this weapon back in 1996 when I started as an equity research analyst for Credit Suisse|First Boston, and I have been perfecting my techniques ever since. My mentors, Michael Mauboussin and Paul Johnson, were the first Wall Street analysts to put this weapon to work on stocks. Michael and Paul published a seminal report on the weapon in January of 1997 titled: Competitive Advantage Period \u201cCAP\u201d \u2013 The Neglected Value Driver. I liked the report so much that I printed out extra copies and handed it out to every analyst at the firm. Michael went on to co-author an entire book on the weapon with Alfred Rappaport called Expectations Investing, which is in its second edition.\nMy favorite quote from the Expectations Investing website is:\n\u201cInvestors who use Expectations Investing will have a fundamentally better way to evaluate all stocks, setting them on the path to success.\u201d\nI agree 100% with that quote. I believe my clients and I get a huge edge from using this weapon. While the concept of expectations investing is rather easy to understand, it is very difficult to apply in the real world, especially at scale. When I started New Constructs, one of the first things my team built into the technology was the ability to mass produce this weapon.\nSo, you\u2019re probably wondering what this \u201cweapon\u201d is. I\u2019m going to tell you what it is, and then I am going to show you how I use it.\nThe weapon is a reverse dynamic discounted cash flow model (DCF). My firm\u2019s clients will tell you that it is not just any discounted cash flow model:\n\n\nIt\u2019s driven by proven-superior fundamental data. Models are only as good as the data that drives them.\nIt is super easy to use.\n\n\nWhat the heck is a \u201cDCF\u201d model?\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a popular valuation tool that analysts use to determine the value of stocks.\nFrom Google: \u201cA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is a financial model that estimates a company\u2019s value by forecasting its future cash flows and discounting them to the present value. The model\u2019s basis is that a company\u2019s value is determined by its ability to generate cash flows for its investors.\nDCF models are based on the belief that the value of an asset is equal to the present value of the cash flows it generates now and in the future. \u201cPresent\u201d value means that the future cash flows are discounted to today\u2019s value. This discount is necessary to account for the fact that cash in hand today is worth more than cash in hand a year from now, i.e. \u201ctime value of money\u201d. The value of future cash flows is lowered by (1) inflation and (2) risk that those cash flows do not materialize.\nTraditional DCF models rely on the analysts to forecast the future cash flows of a company, which determines the value of the company. In other words, they require analysts to predict the future of a company.\nMost DCFs Are NOT Easy To Use\nWhen I first started using the reverse dynamic DCF back in 1996, everything was in an excel model, a very big and complicated model. When I rebuilt the model for the Value Dynamics Framework business that I ran for Credit Suisse|First Boston, I worked hard to simplify and make it easier for my clients (research analysts and portfolio managers) to understand. But, there\u2019s only so much you can do to make a complicated excel model easier to use.\nAnd, even worse, I had to create and build a new DCF model for every new company the team wanted to cover. That meant reading lots of 10K filings, entering lots of data and building out lots of forecasts. Talk about a lot of very complex and complicated work. For those that really want to learn how models work, it makes sense to build at least a couple of these models by hand. After that, you have to be a special kind of nerd to want to do more. You\u2019re probably not surprised to learn that there are not many people on this planet that want to know how these models work enough to invest the time to learn how to build one. Even fewer, who want to build more than the minimum number needed to learn how they work. Trust me, I saw, first hand, the apathy for building good models on Wall Street during the tech bubble.\nI did not share that apathy, and I probably built over a thousand dynamic DCF models. My team built another couple of thousand of these excel models. Yes, I admit that I am a nerd. Just don\u2019t tell my buddies at Renzo Gracie Nashville that.\nThe Robo-Analyst: Necessity is the Mother of Invention\nWhen I wrote the business plan for New Constructs, I knew we needed to automate the creation of these models because they are honestly too much very complicated work for just about any investor to undertake.\nI believed we could build technology that would automate the creation of the models. And, if we were successful, we could give everyone access to this superior analytical weapon for analyzing stocks. Giving everyone access to this weapon meant everyone would be empowered with \u201ca fundamentally better way to evaluate all stocks\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s what New Constructs is about. For those of you that already know me, you probably remember that the mission for New Constructs is \u201cto improve the integrity of the capital markets.\u201d\nThose of you who already know me also know we succeeded in building that technology, which is known in the industry as the Robo-Analyst. It\u2019s been featured in multiple top-tier publications including the Harvard Business School Case 118-068: \u201cNew Constructs: Disrupting Fundamental Analysis with Robo-Analysts\u201d.\nNow, let me show you how I used this weapon to call the top in NVDA.\nWhat the heck is a \u201creverse\u201d DCF model?\nFirst, a quick note on the key concept behind how the \u201creverse\u201d dynamic DCF model works. The first question I like to ask new analyst trainees is: would you rather be a fortune teller or a critic of a fortune teller? I think it\u2019s much easier to be a critic of someone trying to predict the future than to predict it myself. And, a reverse DCF model work the same way. These models do not attempt to predict the future. Instead, they reverse engineer the future cash flows required for the model to produce a value equal to the stock price. In other words, I start with the stock price and figure out what the future cash flows have to be to justify that stock price. Ok, now let\u2019s get into the details.\nHow to Load the Weapon\n*WARNING*\nBuckle up because I\u2019m about to take you deep into nerdland when it comes to valuing stocks.\nI logged into my Robo-Analyst website and opened the model for Nvidia. The first thing I saw: the Default scenario in the DCF model showed that it would take Nvidia over 100 years to grow into the profits needed to justify its stock price. The Default scenario is based on:\n\n\nConsensus estimates for revenue growth\nFuture NOPAT margins are roughly the same as past margins\nCapital efficiency improves pretty aggressively.\n\n\nThe same is true for the Default scenario in most of my models.\nGiven that few investors want to think in terms of a hundred-year forecast horizon, I created two new scenarios for Nvidia\u2019s future cash flows: Optimistic and Pessimistic. Here\u2019s a summary of what I changed versus the Default scenarios:\n\n\nOptimistic scenario: higher revenue growth and higher profit margins\nPessimistic scenario: lower revenue growth and lower profit margins\n\n\nHow To Aim the Weapon\nLet me show you exactly what all that means. Figure 2 is a picture from the Decision page in my firm\u2019s company models. The purpose of the Decision page is to summarize the reverse dynamic DCF into a table and a few charts so clients can get a quick and easy read of the results of the model. Now, there\u2019s still a lot of information to digest here \u2013 I told you to buckle up \u2013 so I am breaking the Decision page into three parts: 1. the summary table (Figure 2), 2. the implied stock price charts (Figure 3) and 3. the implied future revenue and ROIC (Figures 4 & 6).\nFigure 2, from left to right, what the model is showing:\n\n\nThe grey section presents the key variables over recent history.\nRevenue CAGR (\u201cCAGR\u201d stands for Compound Annual Growth Rate)\nROIC \u2013 WACC = Return on Invested Capital minus Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nGAP (Growth Appreciation Period) = my term for CAP (Competitive Advantage Period). They are exactly the same thing.\nForecast 1 section shows the future performances required to justify the current price based on the Optimistic scenario.\nForecast 2 section shows the future performances required to justify the current price based on the Pessimistic scenario.\n\n\nA key benefit to this table is that it allows for easy comparison between past performance of key variables to implied future performance.\nFigure 2: Summary Tables for the Reverse Dynamic DCF for NVDANVDA Summary Tables Reverse DCFNew Constructs, LLC\nTo keep things simple, I am going to focus on explaining the tables based on the stock price of $117.59, or the sections in red boxes.\n\n\nIn the Optimistic scenario, to justify $117.59, Nvdia must grow revenue at 47% CAGR while achieving an average ROIC-WACC spread of 513% for the next 8 years.\nIn the Pessimistic scenario, to justify $117.59, Nvdia must grow revenue at 29% CAGR while achieving an average ROIC-WACC spread of 486% for the next 16 years.\n\n\nWhat is a \u201cdynamic\u201d DCF model?\nOne last explanatory point here. The difference between a dynamic DCF and a traditional DCF model is in the forecast horizon. Traditional DCF models typically have one forecast horizon, e.g 5 years. Dynamic DCF models use multiple forecast horizons so that the user can solve for the GAP or CAP. A shortcoming in traditional DCF models is that they require an assumption on how much the cash flows after the forecast horizon (e.g. 5 years) grow. This future cash flow growth assumption can have a very large impact on the value of the stock. Dynamic DCF models do not require that assumption because their forecast horizons can be extended for as long as necessary to capture all the future cash flow growth.\nHow To Fire the Weapon: Part 1\nAs an investor, the question you must answer is whether or not you believe that Nvidia can achieve the performance implied by the stock price. That question is the entire point of Expectations Investing. The beauty of Expectations Investing is that it relieves the investor of having to predict the future. Instead, the investor gets to be a critic of the future implied by the stock price. Now, a key point here is that the only way to be a well-informed critic is to quantify the expectations embedded in the stock price. And, that is exactly what my reverse dynamic DCF models do for clients.\nAnother way to pose the question is: the market, via the stock price, is predicting that Nvidia can grow revenues and reach the ROIC-WACC spread for the respective GAPs. Do you agree?\n\n\nIf your answer is yes, then the stock is fairly valued.\nIf you think Nvidia will do even better, then the stock is cheap.\nIf you think Nvidia will do worse, then the stock is expensive.\n\n\nNext, I am going to show you how my firm\u2019s models can make answering this question easy.\nFirst, the dynamic DCF quantifies the market\u2019s expectations based on common-sense operational metrics (e.g. revenue growth and ROIC) that you can compare to the historical performance of the business and to your own expectations about the future performance of the business. Valuation doesn\u2019t have to be done through a multiple that\u2019s difficult to understand.\nFigure 3 shows the implied share prices over multiple Growth Appreciation Periods so you can see how the different scenarios affect the valuation of the stock. Not surprisingly, the slope of the Optimistic line is steeper than the Pessimistic line because of the faster revenue CAGR assumptions in the Optimistic scenario. I want you to see this chart because it shows how I find the market-implied GAPs. It shows how I run scenarios over as long a time frame as needed for the DCF model to get to the current stock price. The year in which the DCF model produces a stock value equal to the current stock price is the market-implied GAP. The market-implied GAP is important for many reasons, but, in particular, it is important for creating charts like what I show in Figure 4.\nFigure 3: Summary Tables for the Reverse Dynamic DCF Scenarios for NVDADCF Scenarios Implied Price NVDANew Constructs, LLC\nHow To Fire the Weapon: Part 2\nNow, where this gets fun is using charts to compare historical revenues, ROIC and cash flow to the future levels implied by each scenario. Check out Figure 4, which shows how Nvidia\u2019s past revenue compares to the future revenues implied by each scenario. This chart shows that Nvidia\u2019s revenue will reach $1.3 trillion at the end of its GAP for the Optimistic scenario. I use a no-growth terminal value in my DCF models. The formula is NOPAT(t+1)/WACC. Note that I believe a no-growth terminal value is necessary for a reverse dynamic DCF model to have integrity.\nAnd, its revenue will reach $3.7 trillion at the end of its GAP for the Pessimistic Scenario. The chart also shows the magnitude of the improvement in revenue compared to where the company has been in the past. Just look at how low and flat the revenue line is going back to 2010. The future implied revenues make the past revenue look tiny.\nFigure 4: Comparing Historical Revenue to Implied Future RevenueNVDA Historical Revenue Vs. Implied RevenueNew Constructs, LLC\nStill, when I saw $1.4 and $3.7 trillion, I was stunned. Seems like a big number. How big?\nWe need some context on how big $1.4 and $3.7 trillion in revenue is. Let\u2019s start with the fact that Apple\u2019s revenue at the end of its 3Q24 was $385.6 billion, less than 1/3rd of $1.4 trillion and about 1/10th of $3.7 trillion. Hmm, that makes those revenue expectations seem pretty big. Here\u2019s another perspective: $3.7 trillion in revenue would make Nvidia as big as India, the 5th largest GDP in the world in 2023. See Figure 5.\nRevenues of $1.355 trillion would make Nvidia bigger than Turkey, the #17-ranked country in the world based on 2023 GDP. After seeing that, I decided I thought the future performance expectations for Nvidia might be too high, way too high.\nFigure 5: GDP of Largest Countries in 2023GDP of  Largest Countries 2023New Constructs, LLC\nHow To Fire the Weapon: Part 3\nNext, I wanted to see what the implied future ROICs looked like because companies can grow revenues and take market share if they slash prices and margins, which means ROICs usually come way down. In other words, revenue growth at any level, but especially large revenue growth like that in the Optimistic and Pessimistic scenarios, is next to impossible to achieve while also increasing ROIC. So, I ran the same comparison for ROIC as I did for revenue, and you can see the results in Figure 6.\n\u201cWow\u201d was my reaction. Like Figure 4, Figure 6 shows the magnitude of the improvement in ROIC compared to where the company has been in the past. Nevertheless, more contact on how those implied ROIC compare to the best ROICs in recent history would be helpful.\nFigure 6: Comparing Historical ROIC to Implied Future ROICNVDA Historical vs. Implied ROICNew Constructs, LLC\nMore context is needed here to really understand how reasonable or unreasonable it is to believe that Nvidia will achieve an 839% or 975% ROIC while also growing revenue at the rates shown above.\nFirst, Nvidia\u2019s current ROIC is 195%, which is 6x higher than 2023 and much higher than the 130% it achieved in fiscal year 2024.\nNext, I looked at the number of times over the last 5 years that a company in the S&P 500 achieved an ROIC greater than 100%. Here are the results.\n\n\n100%: 11 times\n200%: 7 times\n300%: 3 times\n500%: 2 times\n600%: 1 time\n700%: none\n\n\nOver the last 5 years, only one company in the S&P 500 averaged more than 100% ROIC.\nLastly, I reviewed two of the highest ROIC businesses of all time in technology: Apple and Microsoft. Figure 7 plots their ROICs from 1998 to present. Apple\u2019s ROIC peaked at nearly 400% and is now well under 100%. Microsoft peaked at 200% and is now well under 30%.\nThe takeaway for me is that it\u2019s more likely that hell will freeze over than Nvidia will get to an ROIC over 800%.\nFigure 7: ROIC Trends for Apple and Microsoft from 1998- PresentROIC Trends in MSFT & AAPLNew Constructs, LLC\nI Love the Smell of Napalm in the Morning\nNeedless to say, I think it\u2019s even less likely that Nvidia will grow revenues at 47% or 29% while also achieving such huge increases in ROIC as detailed in the scenarios above.\nAnd given the liquidity pinch, I decided to call the top for NVDA.\nHow You Get an Edge\nNow, my secret weapon is no longer my secret. It\u2019s yours, too.\nHaving the ability to quantify market expectations with precision and based on the best fundamental data in the world is a huge competitive advantage for investors. Add the ability to compare the performance track records of thousands of companies over the last 25+ years, and I think it\u2019s fair to say I have a pretty powerful weapon that creates a large proprietary edge.\nAs for the other stock I mentioned at the beginning of this letter. It\u2019s Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI). I mentioned it on air on Tuesday as like Nvidia \u2013 a very expensive stock with lots of downside risk. I also pointed out that I suspended the rating for a major red flag found in the footnotes. Needless to say, I was not surprised at all to see the stock take a huge hit this week.\nAs you can see from Figure 8, the company\u2019s Valuation metrics are flashing red. They were even more red before the stock tanked. When I ran the reverse DCF model on SMCI last week, I saw similar signs of over valuation as I saw with Nvidia. Same story, different stock.\nFigure 8: Rating for Super Micro Computer, Inc.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. The artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design\u200b. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets \u2013 over 20% \u2013 to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.  Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. The market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years Prominent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.  The sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports indicate that the chip firm has entered into a partnership with United Arab Emirates-based AI company G42 to advance climate technology. The partnership will focus on developing AI solutions aimed at boosting accuracy of weather forecasting globally. Under the deal, per the two firms, a new operational base would be established, along with a Climate Tech Lab in Abu Dhabi, which would serve as a hub for research and development. This facility would also mobilize the creation of tailored climate and weather solutions which use over 100 petabytes of geophysical data assets.William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji recently initiated coverage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with an Outperform rating. In a research note, the analyst noted that Nvidia had a long and storied history of designing parallel computing systems to handle complex processing tasks, which historically had positioned the chip firm as a leader in niche markets like gaming, automotive, visualization, and high-performance computing, or HPC. However, per Naji, the rising AI tide had catapulted parallel computing to the forefront of the tech industry and had driven massive demand for the company\u2019s GPUs and parallel computing stack.Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. Growing a business is not an easy task. Several factors come into the picture when you talk about growth. In 2019, McKinsey reported that ~50% of the companies that enjoyed healthy and stable shareholder returns but didn\u2019t see top-line growth were either acquired or delisted. Growth is getting tougher amidst new market dynamics such as higher consumer expectations, competitive intensity, and digital disruption. Growth can only be rewarded to businesses that spot opportunities at hyper-granular levels and then seize them quickly. Pricing Power Remains Critical, Says Legendary Investor Warren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., mentioned that he tends to rate businesses based on their ability to increase prices. He pays so much attention to the pricing power that he sometimes doesn\u2019t even consider the people who are managing the business. Buffett has had a successful career of stock picking and takeovers.  The veteran investor has bought companies in the business of railroads and electricity producers, whose pricing power comes from a dearth of competitive options available to their clients. Buffett has also built stakes in several consumer discretionary companies relying on the appeal of their brands to bring in customers. Forecasts for 2024 Wall Street analysts expect that S&P 500 companies are expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024. They anticipate a ~5.4% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 and over ~15% earnings growth in 4Q 2024. The S&P 500\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at ~22.40x as of August 30. The 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio came at ~17.9x, suggesting that the stock valuations might be slightly stretched. Moving forward, the US presidential election remains the most significant potential market catalyst for 2H 2024. Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management believes that inflation numbers might surprise to the upside towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. This is because year over year comparables might become more difficult and the effects of increased Chinese shipping rates start reflecting in the inflation data points. Equity Market Outlook Amidst Uncertain Macro-Economic Environment A \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d backdrop favoured larger and higher-quality companies that are less cyclical and rate-sensitive. Such companies were supported by mania in Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models (AI/LLM) stocks. JPMorgan believes that, in the US equities, momentum crowding and stock market concentration reached multi-decade extremes.   Story Continues Market volatility in the US remains low, with VIX averaging only ~14 for the year to July 2024. This was mainly because of fundamental and technical factors, such as rising markets, risk complacency, and lower realized correlation, among others.In Europe and other areas, the broader equities were supported by improved economic activity and the expectation of multiple Fed cuts at the start of 2024. However, the growth-policy trade-off might worsen in 2H 2024. JPMorgan believes that \u201cthere is a risk of disappointment.\u201d The large bank expects that the Fed might stay \u2018higher-for-longer,\u2019 US activity momentum might decelerate and there can be a softening of pricing and top-line growth. Collectively, this might hurt earnings delivery in 2H 2024. Therefore, investing in stocks with wide economic moats and companies having significant market share should help offset the losses in the remainder of 2024.Our methodologyTo list 10 unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years, we sifted through wide moat ETFs and checked online rankings. Next, we narrowed our list by filtering out the companies that have held a near-monopoly status for years or decades. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of 2Q 2024At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of hedge fund holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Its chips are used in several end markets, such as high-end PCs for gaming, data centers, and automotive infotainment systems. The company accounts for over ~90% of the market share for GPUs.NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s competitive moat remains powerful as it has been investing for more than a decade in software in such a way that allows its hardware to outperform regular silicon. This outperformance takes place as a result of software optimizations and acceleration libraries which are updated constantly.Undoubtedly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a strong economic moat, thanks to its intangible assets regarding its graphics processing units, and switching costs involved around its proprietary software, like the CUDA platform for AI tools. This lets developers use the company\u2019s GPUs to build AI models. Just like iOS, which locks people into the iPhone since developers are making applications for the iPhone, market experts believe that this same thing is happening for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The AI engineers are learning the CUDA platform to program GPUs.The company released its 2Q 2024 financial results, with record quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, up by 15% from 1Q 2023 and up by 122% on a YoY basis. The company\u2019s record revenues were supported by the fact that global data centers continue to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.Rosenblatt Securities reaffirmed a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), giving a price target of $200.00 on 29th\u00a0August.Aoris Investment Management, a specialist international equity manager, released its Q2 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure. Overall NVDA ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Investors are still digesting the Fed\u2019s aggressive rate cut and charting the path forward. Roger Altman, Evercore founder and senior chairman, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the Fed was not \u201cbehind the curve\u201d but it went with a higher-than-expected rate cut amid labor market concerns. Asked if he thinks we are headed toward a soft landing scenario, Altman said yes, as he believes growth is \u201cresilient\u201d and corporate profit outlook is good. Altman said equity markets are headed to have their best year since 1960. \u201cIf the landing is finished and the Fed hits its target, Powell will deserve an A and it would be a pretty miraculous achievement,\u201d Altman said.  While the analyst believes currently it\u2019s a \u201cnear perfect\u201d overall environment for the market, he did point to \u201cstorm clouds\u201d gathering over the international stage including the expanding crisis in the Middle East, Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and America\u2019s overall fiscal situation. For this article we chose 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Buzzing AI Stock on Latest News and Analyst Ratings?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley recently said in a note that spending on AI chips must rise to meet even modest expectations from large language model (LLM) developers. The analyst noted that the recent sell-off in AI chip stocks, especially after NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, has raised concerns about whether the market is nearing a peak. However, O\u2019Malley emphasized that these fears overlook the significant compute needs required to power future AI models.  Barclays identified three key takeaways for the semiconductor sector: First, the need for compute resources is expected to surge. For instance, by 2027, just three frontier models with 50 trillion parameters each could require around 20 million chips for training alone. The demand for compute is anticipated to outpace improvements in chip performance.   Story Continues Second, a dual approach to AI accelerators is emerging. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD, and startups are expected to dominate in training and inference for frontier models, while hyperscale companies will rely on custom silicon for specialized tasks.Third, inference, where AI models apply learned knowledge, will play a significant role in monetizing frontier models. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) claims that 40% of its chips are already used for inference, with more providers focusing on this market to drive down costs and improve return on investment.O\u2019Malley concluded that the AI chip industry is still in its early stages, and higher investments in compute resources are critical to meet future demands.Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia\u2019s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be \u201cconfusing\u201d for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House. Lee said that the market is going to trade \u201cwell\u201d into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects \u201csome\u201d rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said: \u201c A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it\u2019s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it\u2019s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative.\"  However, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive. For this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Top AI Stock to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings?   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing. \u201cWe\u2019re in a computer revolution,\u201d Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a skill.  Huang also emphasized the need for \u201cdensification,\u201d with NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it.   Story Continues Nvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Of course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The reality is finally catching up to the AI hype as investors await to see ROI on huge spending on AI chips and infrastructure. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in the industry. \u201cI know it\u2019s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing. And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.\u201d  Niles said that major tech companies went through a \u201cdigestion\u201d period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year. The analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.  Niles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new \u201call-time record highs.\u201d For this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Top 10 Trending AI Stock Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cposter child\u201d of AI Nvidia\u2019s declines represents a fundamental shift in tech stocks where investors expect ROI. \u201cDuring 2021, revenue growth for Nvidia was up 62% year over year.. 2022, revenues were up 6% and the stock went down from peak to trough 66%. If you look at CapEX spending over the last two years and you see Nvidia\u2019s revenues, Nvidia\u2019s revenues last year grew over a 100%, this year they are gonna grow over a 100%,\u00a0 I think what you are gonna see next year is a dramatic slowdown not only from the spending from hyperscalers but also in Nvidia\u2019s revenues as those hyperscalers grow into all of this money that they have spent that\u2019s not actually generating an increase in their revenue.\u201d    Story Continues What Niles is saying is not new. After Nvidia\u2019s latest quarterly report, here is what InsiderMonkey\u2019s Research Director Inan Dogan\u00a0wrote in a report:Nvidia\u2019s market cap before today\u2019s earnings report was $3.1 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $140 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 21. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s quarterly revenue and profit were $30 billion and $16.6 billion respectively though. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA\u2019s quarterly profit can go from $16.6 billion today to $35 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL\u2019s quarterly profit is growing? Aoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer can't stop talking about. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advises that worrying about what others are concerned about or getting excited about what everyone anticipates is generally futile for investors. When most investors expect something to happen, it\u2019s often already factored into stock prices. \u201cYou want to know the single most useless thing you can do in this business? Oh, that\u2019s easy. The most useless thing you can do as an investor is to worry about what everyone else is worrying about. The flip side of this is also true: there\u2019s no point in getting excited about something that everybody else is eagerly anticipating. Why? Because when the vast majority of investors agree that something\u2019s going to happen, that thing is already priced into the stock market.\u201d  The stock market reacts quickly to the consensus of hedge fund and mutual fund managers, so by the time the majority agrees on an economic trend, it\u2019s already reflected in stock values. Cramer points out that while the real economy moves at a steady pace\u2014through borrowing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling\u2014stocks adjust almost instantly to new information. This rapid adjustment means that, once big institutional investors align on a particular economic outlook, it is already embedded in the market. \u201cWhile the real economy moves at its own steady pace\u2014for example, you have to borrow money to build out equipment, then use that equipment to manufacture goods, transport them to retail outlets, and wait for customers to buy them\u2014the stock market has no such limitations. Stocks don\u2019t quite travel at the speed of thought, but they come pretty close. So, the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that\u2019s already the case.  The Efficient Markets Hypothesis Jim Cramer points out that understanding some basic economics can be quite useful for managing investments, even though economists often use complex models that don\u2019t always align with real-world data. Economists can be too focused on their theories and may ignore conflicting data, but basic economic principles can still offer valuable insights. One key concept Cramer highlights is the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.   Story Continues This theory suggests that stock prices at any given moment already include all available information. When new data comes out, stock prices quickly adjust to reflect this updated reality. Index fund advocates use this theory to argue that it\u2019s nearly impossible for stock pickers to outperform the market, as all known information is already factored into stock prices.\u201cThis is some basic economics 101 stuff. Now, I don\u2019t have a ton of use for economists as professionals on this show\u2014they tend to take a totally ivory-tower approach to their discipline, meaning they have all sorts of models for how the economy is supposed to work (often very boring models, by the way). But they rarely let empirical facts get in the way of a good theory. If the data conflicts with the model, economists have a bad habit of throwing away the data, not the model. However, as long as you keep that caveat in mind, some basic economics is incredibly useful when you\u2019re trying to manage your own money. Jim Cramer explains that if all possible information about a stock is already reflected in its price, then doing detailed research may not give you an edge. In this view, the only factors that can move a stock\u2019s price are new, unexpected pieces of information. If such information were known to anyone, it would already be factored into the stock price.\u201cIf everything you could possibly know is already priced into the stock, that means your homework is meaningless, and the only thing that can push a stock higher or lower is some random new piece of information nobody knows about. It has to be something totally unknown because, if anyone did know, they would have already acted on it, and thus it would be baked into the share price.\u201d Essentially, they believe that only completely new, unknown information can influence stock prices, which makes individual stock investing seem like a gamble. Cramer acknowledges that while economists and their theories might seem detached from practical investing, understanding concepts like market efficiency can help investors navigate the complexities of stock investing.\u201cThis means that, under the extreme version of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, the only things that can move stocks are \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201d to use the parlance of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. And if you\u2019re merely betting on unknown unknowns, you might as well just be playing roulette\u2014it\u2019s more fun. Our MethodologyThis article looks at a recent episode of Jim Cramer\u2019s\u00a0Mad Money, where he discussed several stocks. We\u2019ve selected ten notable companies from his mentions. The article also explores how hedge funds perceive these stocks and ranks them according to their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least owned to the most owned.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179Jim Cramer explains that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) often appears expensive based on future earnings estimates, but it consistently surpasses those expectations, making the stock look undervalued in hindsight. This pattern has been a remarkable feature of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) since 2012. Cramer advises investors not to focus too much on daily fluctuations in a stock\u2019s price. Instead, it\u2019s important to discern when these movements are meaningful signals versus when they are simply noise with no real significance.\u201cWhen you look at NVIDIA on forward earnings or estimates, it always looks expensive, and then it so far trumps those estimates that when you look backward, it turns out the stock was selling at a remarkably low price. That\u2019s been the secret to NVIDIA literally since 2012\u2014incredible! It just keeps doing that, right? Please don\u2019t put too much significance on day-to-day gyrations in a stock\u2019s share price. You have to know when something is a signal and when it\u2019s all just sound and noise, always signifying nothing.\u201d NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a highly attractive investment due to its leading role in the semiconductor industry, particularly in GPUs and AI technologies, as well as its impressive financial performance and expanding market opportunities. As a dominant player in tech, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) benefits from the rapid growth in AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.In its Q2 FY2024 earnings report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $13.51 billion, marking a 101% increase from the previous year. This growth is driven by exceptional demand for its GPUs, particularly those used in AI and data centers, with the Data Center segment seeing a 171% revenue boost. This underscores NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s pivotal role in supporting AI technologies and large language models.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strong momentum is further supported by its strategic partnerships and innovative product offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a key player in the AI revolution, providing essential hardware to cloud providers, enterprises, and research institutions. Its recent collaborations to advance generative AI solidify its leadership position. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding into new areas such as automotive and edge computing, where its AI and GPU technologies are increasingly being adopted. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s ongoing investment in research and development and its robust product pipeline keep it at the cutting edge of innovationOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer can't stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

While everyone is talking about rate cuts, some analysts are questioning whether it was necessary even to start cutting rates at this time. Latest data released on Tuesday showed retail sales in the US rose while Wall Street analysts were expecting to see a decline. Oksana Aronov, JPMorgan Asset Management head of market strategy for alternative fixed income, said while talking to CNBC that rate cuts are not even warranted as she thinks there are no signs of broader weakening except for the labor market.  Aronov said cutting rates would \u201cloosen\u201d the financial conditions further. The analyst said that about 14 months ago, everyone was looking at the CPI that was clocking in at 3% and expected the metric to fall to 2%. But even after all these months, CPI year over year is at 2.9%. She said that the Fed should move carefully and the 2% inflation target would be \u201celusive\u201d because fiscal spending will continue to rise. AI investors are however looking beyond this debate and already positioning to pile into more growth stocks amid the beginning of the rate-cut cycle. For this article, we picked 10 buzzing AI stocks and discussed the latest news around them. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?   Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Dan Niles, founder and portfolio manager at Niles Investment Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that despite his belief that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is going through a \u201cdigestion\u201d phase as investors fear a slowdown in spending and want to see a return on their investments, the chipmaker\u2019s shares and revenue could double. \u201cI firmly believe in the next several years that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revenues will again be able to double from current levels and the stock will be able to double as well.\u201d  Niles yet again mentioned the Cisco analogy, saying the company saw several years of revenue growth before hitting its peak.   Story Continues Nvidia\u2019s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Of course, Nvidia won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.

AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.

Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.  The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer thinks deserve attention. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold off on selling stocks, anticipating a rebound once the market\u2019s downturn ended. This strategy proved effective as the average investor saw gains, with the Dow rising by 484 points or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing by 1.16%. This performance suggests that selling during Friday\u2019s decline was not the best move. \u201cLast week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday\u2019s downturn wasn\u2019t the best strategy.\u201d  The previous week was challenging for economically sensitive stocks and tech stocks, despite the August employment report showing modest growth and a downward revision for July. The recent report seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as it presented a balanced scenario of neither too strong nor too weak. Nonetheless, Wall Street reacted negatively, with investors moving away from cyclical stocks in favor of recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. Industrials and semiconductors were particularly affected. Jim Cramer observed that on Monday, recession-proof stocks such as pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform strongly. However, this trend is concerning as these stocks have surged significantly and might be due for a correction. \u201cRecession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.\u201d  According to Cramer, historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it\u2019s a signal to shift investment strategies. With the Fed moving towards easing and a rate cut expected next week, Cramer suggests it\u2019s time to reconsider holding recession-proof stocks. Instead, investors should look at more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulation. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn can be challenging, anticipating a positive impact from the Fed\u2019s rate cuts could make these stocks attractive.   Story Continues \u201cHistorically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it\u2019s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it\u2019s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it\u2019s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It\u2019s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.\u201d At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Does Jim Cramer Think NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)) Stock Deserves Your Attention?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179Jim Cramer questioned whether artificial intelligence is still a hot topic, given recent trading patterns. He pointed out that stocks associated with AI, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a key player in the AI space and a name in his investment club\u2014have dropped nearly 14% over the past five sessions. This decline raises doubts about current investor interest in AI-related investments.\u201cDoes anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore? Seems fair to ask considering the recent trading in stocks lumped into the AI trade, including key enabler and fellow Club name Nvidia, which is down almost 14% in the past five sessions.\u201d A positive outlook on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is supported by its impressive financial performance and leadership in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. In Q2 FY2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s revenue surged 122% year-over-year to $30 billion, with net income increasing 168% to $16.6 billion.

Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that since 1990, the market on average gains about 18% between the last rate hike and the first rate cut. However, during the 30 days after the first rate cut, the market historically \u201ctread water,\u201d gaining less than \u201cone half of one percent.\u201d \u201cMost of the action is below surface however, in the sectors, areas where a lot of the leaders be in the defensive areas but I have to add technology in there because investors don\u2019t want to be giving up on the growth,\u201d Stovall said.  Stovall pointed to another important historical data point regarding election years. He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.  For this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors\u2019 radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Trending AI Stock to Watch in September?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 New Street Research recently said in a note that AI infrastructure demand has no slowdown in sight and gave bullish comments about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm believes Nvidia\u2019s key advantage over its competitors like AMD is the full-stack and system-scale integration abilities of its GPUs. These allow for greater chip-to-chip bandwidth interconnect across a larger domain. Comparing NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with AMD, New Street Research analyst\u00a0 Pierre Ferragu said: \u201cIt nevertheless doesn\u2019t disqualify AMD, whose architecture is less versatile, less scalable, but can still be competitive, but on a much more limited set of use-cases, and at the cost of dedicated optimization efforts.\u201d    Story Continues NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports that were confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).Nvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Of course, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) won\u2019t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia\u2019s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion\u2014less than half of the total market\u2014but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.

Afterwards, the stock price dropped, including a one-day loss that set a record for market capitalization drops. A number of recent events may explain investors' apparent caution, including rumors of a subpoena from anti-trust investigators, worries about an industry-wide slowdown in high-speed chip purchases and delays in shipments of its next-generation product. Despite making a bit of recovery over the last few days, $NVDA still sits lower than it did pre-earnings call.  Some analysts brush off the recent price slump and maintain high price targets, while others suspect Nvidia may be in for a short-term correction or a least a slowing of an appreciation trend that has seen the shares rise by triple-digit percentages in 2024. A financial advisor can help you evaluate analyst reports and determine how an individual stock might fit into your investment portfolio. Nvidia Business Developments For almost any other firm, Nvidia's second-quarter 2025 earnings represented the business equivalent of a home run. Revenues topped $30 billion, a robust 122% improvement over the same quarter last year and even ahead of optimistic consensus analyst forecasts. Net income increased by a still-more impressive 168% over second-quarter 2024 to nearly $16.6 billion. CEO Jensen Huang released guidance suggesting revenues would continue improving in the next quarter as the company prepared to begin volume shipments of its new Blackwell chip.  Yet investors responded by shunning the stock, which slumped moderately in trading the following day. In the next session after the Labor Day market closure, Nvidia shares fell nearly 10%. The resulting loss of nearly $280 billion in market capitalization represented a Wall Street record. Since this epic collapse, Nvidia has traded in a narrow range around $106, well below its 52-week high of $140.76.   $NVDA dropped following its Q2 2025 earnings call.

One is that even its stellar earnings report could not match investors' unrealistic expectations. Another is that Huang failed to indicate precisely how much the new Blackwell chip would contribute in the fourth quarter. Looming over all is a widespread perception that global enthusiasm for AI is beginning to wane. As something of a sideshow, the company reportedly got subpoenaed as part of a Department of Justice antitrust investigation, but this issue has somewhat subsided after Nvidia denied receiving the subpoena.   Story Continues Sign up for the Market Minute newsletter for news that may impact Nvidia and other potential investments.Analyst ExpectationsAs befits the S&P 500's top-performing stock for 2024, Nvidia gets a lot of analyst coverage. The company's investor relations webpage lists nearly 50 financial institutions with analysts assigned to the stock. The majority have been bullish, with some pegging price targets as high as $200. They remain generally positive about the stock today, after its 10-for-1 stock split in June, with some exceptions.One analyst perspective on Nvidia holds that it is a victim of its own success. After its share price increased by more than 100% during 2024, to the point the company became valued at more than $3 trillion, the most optimistic among its investors are now capable of being disappointed by even impressive results like the ones Nvidia reported for the second quarter. As a result, the stock declined after its earnings release. Not everyone agrees with this assessment. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse continues to rate Nvidia a buy with a $175 price target following the earnings report.Another viewpoint examines details of the quarterly performance, particularly comments made by company leaders during the earnings call. In that call, Huang and CFO Colette Kress indicated its new Blackwell chip would contribute billions of dollars of sales during the fourth quarter. This is three months behind the original schedule for volume shipments of Blackwell and, importantly, the two didn't indicate whether the sales boost would be only a few billions or several billions. That raised questions about whether Blackwell would significantly boost revenues during fiscal 2025. Seeking Alpha cited this issue among others in downgrading Nvidia from a sell to a strong sell.A more macro issue is the sustainability of global demand for AI. Experts have recently questioned how long corporations will continue ordering billions of dollars' worth of Nvidia AI-related chips and systems when, to date, few companies can point to significant profits from AI investments. Morgan Stanley analyst Shawn Kim has expressed the opinion that the chip business is approaching a peak in its sales cycle. If correct, that may not allow Nvidia's revenues to continue increasing into next year. Meanwhile, as recent events indicate, investors are poised to punish any perceived failure to live up to even inflated expectations.To keep up to date on economic and financial news that may impact the stock market and $NVDA, sign up for the Market Minute newsletter.Bottom LineNvidia's recent business performance remains excellent, with huge increases in revenues and profits. However, investors have pulled back from the stock due to a combination of factors. Analysts cite unrealistic expectations, potentially disappointing or delayed revenues from an important new product and a possible global slowdown in corporate investment in AI among reasons for the recent cooling of investor interest in Nvidia. For first time in a while, some analysts are less than sanguine about Nvidia's prospects, but others remain optimistic that the company, which commands a dominating share of the global market for high-speed chips used in AI systems, still has a long way to run.TipsFinding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid \u2014 in an account that isn\u2019t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest.\u00a0Compare savings accounts from these banks.

In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there\u2019s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he\u2019s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it\u2019s worth paying attention to what\u2019s going right. \"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I\u2019m willing to declare that there\u2019s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I\u2019m not trying to call a bottom, let\u2019s make that crystal clear, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at what\u2019s actually going right\u2014not just what\u2019s going wrong.\"  Cramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it\u2019s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn\u2019t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in. \"Sure, the market\u2019s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren\u2019t even oversold yet\u2014at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there\u2019s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don\u2019t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"  Cramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling. \"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let\u2019s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That\u2019s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won\u2019t deny that the economy is weakening.\"  However, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it\u2019s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.   Story Continues \"But let\u2019s be realistic: You can\u2019t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there\u2019s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates when business is booming. That\u2019s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday\u2019s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\" Our MethodologyThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179Jim Cramer addressed concerns about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock weakness and whether it signals an impending recession. He clarified that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s recent quarter wasn\u2019t impacted by low demand but rather by supply issues with its high-end Blackwell chips. The problem was not with demand but with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s ability to produce enough chips due to these constraints. He noted that such fluctuations in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s market cap are not unprecedented and will likely occur again.\"What about tech weakness as a recession signal? I keep hearing Nvidia may have missed its quarter due to economic softness. Let\u2019s put that rumor to bed. The issue wasn\u2019t demand; it was Nvidia\u2019s inability to produce enough of its high-end Blackwell chips due to supply constraints. This wasn\u2019t a demand issue. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the tech industry, particularly in AI, gaming, and high-performance computing. For Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $13.51 billion, up 101% from the previous year, driven by a massive surge in demand for AI chips. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s data center revenue soared by 171% to $10.32 billion, reflecting the growing need for GPUs in AI applications like generative AI and large language models.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s net income also jumped to $6.19 billion from $656 million a year earlier, and its earnings per share reached $2.70, exceeding Wall Street's forecast. Recent updates highlight NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s expanding role in AI. In August 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) introduced its next-generation AI chip, the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which is designed to further accelerate AI tasks.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than the ones on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Therefore, it is important to explore the role finfluencers (influencers sharing financial advice on social media) play in providing investment information and how Gen-Z investors engage with finfluencers. Young investors are considering memes and viral videos as the primary source of investment advice. Social Media and Investments: Do They Complement Each Other? Experts believe that retail or non-professional investors are now becoming dependent on digital channels, like social media platforms such as TikTok, when it comes to investing. FINRA revealed that ~60% of US investors under age 35 believe that social media can be used as a source of investment information. This compares to ~57% who use finance professionals. This increase is probably because digital channels are becoming easily accessible, with\u00a0~60%\u00a0of the global population utilizing social media (as per DataReportal).  Quick-scroll websites are now considered the go-to spot for investment ideas and inspiration. This is because of their bite-sized format and easy access. Ofcom, which tracks news consumption in the UK \u2013 revealed that TikTok\u2019s reach for news went up from ~1% in 2020 to ~7% in 2022. This was mainly seen in younger folks aged between 16 \u2013 24 years. Pew Research mentioned that, in the US, this increased from ~3% in 2020 to ~10% in 2022. Financial advice content, which is shared on social media, has been contributing to the growth of the \u201ccreator economy,\u201d which is pegged at ~$127 billion globally (as per Coherent Market Insights). This is expected to reach\u00a0US$528.39 billion\u00a0by 2030, with growth stemming from higher demand for user-generated content and increased monetization opportunities. Financial institutions and investment advisory companies are now focusing on creating pathways from social media to their product and services to exploit strong market opportunities. Therefore, most retail investors continue to make investing decisions under social media\u2019s influence. Retail Traders Making a Significant Portion in The US Stock Options JPMorgan Chase & Co. highlighted that non-professional investors\u00a0are now making a bigger part of the US\u00a0options market as they continue to pour money mainly into\u00a0short-term bets\u00a0and technology stocks. The bank highlighted that retail traders accounted for ~18.3% of the total options activity in June. Social media and online investing communities have influenced retail investors to the extent that these investors don\u2019t shy away from making investments in the downturn.   Story Continues In late July and early August 2024, when there was a sharp decline in popular technology shares, retail investors turned out to be net buyers.Vanda Research mentioned that individual investors, who were caught up in the market downturn, continued to be net buyers of shares of leading technology and AI-related companies. Just to balance out the risks, retail investors directed significant buying to an ETF tracking 20-Y Treasury bonds. Wall Street experts and enthusiasts believe that this confidence comes from the online investing communities and social media platforms, where there were discussions about going long on leading technology shares as they were trading at \u201cdecent levels.\u201dAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of hedge fund holders: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a technology company. It is engaged in developing a platform for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, and focuses on PC graphics.The company\u2019s intangible assets associated with its graphics processing units and increased switching costs concerning its proprietary software are expected to act as principal growth enablers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s roots revolve around gaming, and the company\u2019s patents related to hardware design helped it achieve market leading position in gaming GPUs. As a result of this dominant position, the company was able to build economies of scale and invest in R&D efforts.Spectrum-X Ethernet for Al and NVIDIA Al Enterprise software are the new product categories that are achieving significant scale. This demonstrates that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack and data center-scale platform.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s advanced intellectual property has created significant barriers to entry, which was evident when Intel decided to license IP from this tech giant. Notably, the data centers remain critical to power Al systems which can perform difficult tasks, such as speech recognition and photo recognition. Therefore, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to focus on leveraging its GPU prowess in emerging areas like data centers and automotive.Wall Street analysts believe that a new class of products, data processing units (DPUs), can handle certain tasks. This will allow CPUs to focus on core applications. These analysts anticipate that DPUs will become commonplace in all servers.For 3Q 2025, the company\u2019s revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins should be in the range of 74.4% and 75.0%. In 2Q 2025, the company saw record quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, exhibiting a rise of 15% from 1Q 2025 and 122% YoY. The revenues were supported by global data centers, which continue to focus on modernizing the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative Al.UBS Group upped their price objective on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $120.00 to $150.00. They gave a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on 8th\u00a0July.Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia\u2019s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia\u2019s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will go to the moon. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Bloomberg News, and other media outlets, are reporting that government officials in Beijing are calling on Chinese businesses to source artificial intelligence (AI) microchips produced within China, and to avoid Nvidia\u2019s chips, which are among the most powerful in the world.  The pressure to buy local comes as the Chinese government tries to bolster its domestic semiconductor industry amid an ongoing trade spat with the U.S. China\u2019s Ministry of Information and Technology has singled out Nvidia\u2019s H20 series of chips, which are used to power AI models and applications, saying domestic companies should not buy those chips. Escalating Tensions Over Microchips  Officials in Beijing have stopped short of an outright ban on Nvidia\u2019s microchips in the nation of 1.4 billion people. Rather, government officials say they are providing \u201cguidance\u201d to local companies and encouraging the purchase of Chinese made products. The renewed focus on buying Chinese microchips and semiconductors comes amid escalating tensions with the U.S. over the technology. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has imposed export controls on microchips and processors to China, citing concerns that the technology will be used to further develop the country\u2019s military capabilities.  China has accounted for 25% of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenues in the past. In recent months, the chipmaker had found ways to continue selling its high-end microchips to Chinese companies without violating American export controls. Essentially, Nvidia is selling chips to China that are based on its popular H100 microchip but that have 50% less computing power. Is NVDA Stock a Buy? Nvidia\u2019s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 42 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 39 Buy and three Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. There are no Sell ratings on the stock. The average price target of $152.44 implies 25.68% upside from current levels.

After the latest 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market has been performing well. All of the major market indices have been in the green since then and experts are taking it as a good sign. We discussed the Fed\u2019s rate cut in our article about the best day trading stocks. Here is an excerpt from the article: \u201c\u2026the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chose to lower its policy interest rate by 50 basis points, a move intended to ease monetary policy. Powell explained that this action reflects growing confidence that labor market strength can be maintained, while inflation continues to decrease toward the Fed\u2019s target. Powell emphasized the Fed\u2019s flexibility in its approach and noted that future rate changes will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic landscape.  Understanding the Current Stock Market Optimism Lead writer for Markets Live at The Wall Street Journal, Gunjan Banerji also shares the market\u2019s optimistic sentiment as she explained in an interview with CNBC on September 25. Banerji discussed the growing optimism in the stock market despite ongoing bullish sentiment for the past few years. She highlighted how the recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve boosted market confidence, with the VIX (volatility index) dropping to its lowest levels and other indicators like high-yield bonds and options showing continued belief in the rally.  Dominic Chu of CNBC expressed concerns about potential market overconfidence, given the calmness amid geopolitical risks, the upcoming U.S. presidential election, and consumer spending challenges. Banerji acknowledged these risks but emphasized that much of the market\u2019s optimism is tied to the Fed\u2019s actions, with people reassured by the larger-than-expected rate cut. Finally, Banerji pointed out a broadening of the market rally beyond the tech sector and mentioned the strong performances in sectors like energy and materials, and record highs from companies like Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, which indicates a healthier, more diverse market rally.   Story Continues Our MethodologyFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify nearly 60 mid to mega-cap stocks with year-to-date share price returns of over 100%.

The stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating from 64 analysts. As of September 24, the average price target of $150.00 represents an upside of 24.10% from the present levels.One of the most eagerly awaited developments is the Blackwell product line. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) forecasts substantial revenue from this new series, which promises to be a game-changer in the field. The order book for both the current Hopper chip lineup and its successor, Blackwell, is strong.The products feature advanced technology that allows clusters of NVIDIA chips to function as cohesive units that process massive amounts of data and execute computations at unprecedented speeds. This is especially valuable for training the neural networks that power modern AI applications.Demand for the company\u2019s existing products remains strong, and as supply chains improve, orders for the Blackwell range are steadily increasing. CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that the company is ramping up production of the Blackwell GPU and is on track to begin shipments in the fourth quarter.While some engineering challenges have arisen that may delay certain product releases, the overall momentum is positive, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is ready to scale production as it moves into the next year.NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was held by 179 hedge funds in the second quarter and the stakes amounted to $53.67 billion.

The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA\u2019s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock\u2019s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia\u2019s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best performing long-term stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Markets are likely bracing for increased volatility ahead of the Fed's policy decision in September (2024). The consensus expectation is for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points to 5.00% - 5.25% during the September 2024 meeting. This will be the first rate cut since the committee began raising rates to tackle inflation. Historically, September has been a challenging month for most assets. Notably, since the post-World War II era, major stock indices have consistently recorded significant losses in the month of September relative to other months.  Additional data to consider amidst the volatility include the labor market report to be released in the first week of September, and the CPI report the following week. Given the historical trends and upcoming Fed policy decision, investors may need to prepare for continued market uncertainty and potential downside risk in the weeks ahead. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. What is the market telling us: Nvidia\u2019s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 22 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today\u2019s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago, when the company gained 5.3% after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US producer price index (PPI - prices that businesses charge for their goods and services) in July 2024 increased 2.2% year on year, falling compared to the 2.7% y/y growth recorded in the previous month. The report also revealed a month-on-month growth of 0.1%, below analysts' estimates of 0.2%.  In addition, Core PPI (prices excluding food and energy) were flat month on month. PPI is often considered a leading indicator of CPI since what businesses pay tends to be passed through to consumers. Overall, the data confirmed that inflation is cooling off. This is a favorable data point supporting an interest rate cut by the Fed. Notably, markets expect the first rate cut to be announced during the September 2024 policy meeting. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.   Story Continues Nvidia is up 129% since the beginning of the year, but at $110.09 per share it is still trading 18.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,823.When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.  Altimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months. How Is Big Tech Impacting Other Sectors? A recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently. The primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient. With this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.   Story Continues Our Methodology\u00a0For our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

It is based in Santa Clara, California.While the semiconductor sector has historically been highly cyclical, meaning that stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tend to go through boom and bust cycles in line with the economy, this chip maker's recent performance has been such that investors are confident in its ability to weather any storm. Over the past four quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has posted record results, with profit margins expanding to over 60%.The driving force behind these results is the fact that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) products are seeing high demand from almost every cloud infrastructure company and AI start-up. Because of this demand, investors believe that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could continue to do well even in a recession. In fact, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing so much demand that it's struggling to meet the needs of those vying for its components - this then has become one of the biggest challenges for the company, with CEO Jensen Huang beginning to feel the pressure to deliver more Nvidia products to a growing number of customers.In total, 179 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $53.7 billion.Overall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

When it comes to making money on the stock market, most investors are typically attracted to growth stocks. Growth stocks are primarily identified by the price to earnings ratio (P/E) for those firms that are profitable. A higher P/E ratio compared to the industry multiple means that investors have already priced in future growth into the share price to an extent and any surpassing of investor expectations sees the share price appreciate. Since some firms, particularly those in the software as a service (SaaS) industry, reinvest their revenue into growth, their earnings are often negative. Subsequently, the growth potential of these stocks is evaluated by their EV/Sales ratio, and you can find more details by reading\u00a011 Best Cloud Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.  However, while these metrics are important for evaluating stocks, they often do not cover the riskiest stocks that promise the highest returns. In theory, stocks with the lowest prices often carry a higher potential of 10x or even 100x gains. This is because their low prices and small market size both have a substantially larger potential for growth when compared to bigger firms. These returns typically materialize over the course of several decades. For instance, after accounting for their stock splits, the three most valuable firms in the world were trading at $0.10, $0.11, and $0.04, respectively. In today\u2019s post inflationary terms, this means that their shares started to trade at $0.19, $0.21, and $0.08 in the same order. As a result, these bottom barrel stocks at the time of their IPOs, have delivered 183,916%, 401,600%, and 256,975% in returns through price appreciation after their stock market debut. In short, these\u00a01,500x+\u00a0returns through price appreciations are what drive countless investors to flock to the stock market daily. Yet, these returns also mean that investors, particularly inexperienced ones or those on the retail side, fall victim to scams. In fact, along with offering the highest potential for returns, micro cap stocks are also the ones with the greatest number of scams. For instance, one common way in which stock brokerages target unsuspecting retail investors is through a chop stock. This practice isn\u2019t illegal, but it involves the seller withholding key information from the buyer. A chop stock is a stock that a brokerage buys from a large shareholder at a deep discount and then sells to unwary buyers at market price which creates a conflict of interest for the selling party as it stands to significantly profit from any sale.   Story Continues While there are no surefire ways to spot a chop stock, an investor should be on the lookout for stocks that their brokerages (or others) are selling at slight or medium discounts to the market price, and in case of the brokerages, not disclosing the commission made from the sale. The mantra is simple: If it\u2019s too good to be true, it generally is. While all this sounds nefarious, it isn\u2019t the only legal way that gullible investors are exploited on the stock market.In fact, one of the more common and legal ways through which investors, particularly in smaller companies, are harmed is additional share issues by firms who are struggling to raise capital through profits or debt financing. Share sales, even though they provide investors an opportunity to profit via price appreciations, are less riskier than debt issues since in case a company becomes a gone concern, debt holders are required to be paid back first. Naturally, firms prefer them for these reasons, but the more shares are issued, the lower the value of existing equity becomes. Consequently, you are likely to see micro cap stocks in particular drop in prices after management announces additional equity raises.Additionally, firms that are struggling operationally try to shore up their corresponding stock devaluation through reverse stock splits. These reduce the number of shares outstanding but also end up providing unwary investors with a false sense of comfort in seeing the value of their investments increase. Since the share price appreciation is unrelated to business fundamentals, it carries the risk of depreciation in the future if the firm fails to reverse poor performance. This fact is also backed by research from the University of Texas and Lamar University. After analyzing 1,206 reverse stock splits between 1995 and 2011, the research\u00a0demonstrates\u00a0that less than half, 500 or 41%, of the firms, were able to continue operations for five years or longer after the reverse split. Out of the other 59%, a whopping 80% were de listed from exchanges less than five years after the reverse split, for reasons that include bankruptcy. The remaining 20% were acquired, and for this subset, the median survival time post split was just 20.9 months.There are some tips that an investor can use to avoid stock scams. For instance, one should never fall for a sense of urgency created by the seller, believe only in verifiable and raw numbers as opposed to \u2018testimonials\u2019 that promise quick riches, ensure that anyone selling an investment is a licensed finance professional, be on the lookout for effort free ways to quickly make massive amounts of money, and follow the principle of \u2018if it\u2019s too good to be true, it generally isn\u2019t.\u2019 Other warning signs of micro cap stock fraud include stocks of shell companies with little to no operations, heavy promotion of the stock as opposed to the actual business, sudden and rapid jumps in share prices and trading volume, and trading suspensions by the SEC.Investment research websites, newsletters, emails, and even newspapers can all pitch micro cap stock scams. So just because the source appears credible doesn\u2019t mean the underlying stock is as well. Finally, research is a non negotiable for any investment decision, and the\u00a0SEC has listed\u00a0several ways to conduct research. Yet, just because a firm regularly releases information doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s ripe for investment solely because of this fact.With these details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some high risk high reward growth stocks to buy.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).  Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The High Risk High Reward Growth Stock To Buy?  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world\u2019s largest and most valuable GPU designer which also has exposure to the tangential data center networking, autonomous driving, and consumer and professional graphics industries. Its high performing GPUs have allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. Its GPUs are one of the hottest commodities in the world, which provides the firm with a wide moat. However, their short supply and the rush in the industry to implement AI software have also forced companies to look for alternatives to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s products. This has seen firms like OpenAI work with Broadcom to design NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU alternatives. Additionally, the firm can see stricter action by the US government for purported abuse of market power as well as an AI slowdown or a GPU glut to create further headwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares that have lost 23% since mid June. However, the firm\u2019s key competitive advantages because of its strong product performance and established demand for its products make NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) less risky than most of the stocks on our list.Artisan Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That\u2019s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA\u2019s market cap is now $3 trillion. So is the GDP of France. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high risk and high reward stocks. But our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.Disclosure: None.

The past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that\u2019d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the \u201cApp Store moment.\u201d  UBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%. UBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs. \u201cAnnual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.\u201d  For this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Are Analysts Recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Stock?   NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Oppenheimer Asset Management recently gave a Buy rating to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).   Story Continues \u201cKey positives for NVDA remain the stock\u2019s bullish trend, high-momentum score, and portfolio tailwinds from a relatively strong Technology sector. In terms of trading, NVDA has inflected positively above the bullish slope of its 200-day average indicating a resumption of the stock\u2019s uptrend, in our view,\u201d the firm said.However, Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business Professor of Finance, reiterated his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) thesis on a latest program on CNBC, calling the stock overvalued.\u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an amazing company, great growth, amazing cash flow, superb margins, but you are paying a premium price even given all of those pluses,\u201d Damodaran said.Asked what\u2019d be a better buy than NVDA, Damodaran said AMZN is a better stock.\u201cGiven the earnings and their cash flows if I had to buy a stock now and you forced me to a buy a big tech, I\u2019d rather own Amazon I\u2019d buy Amazon than buy Nvidia right now,\u201d Damodaran added. Aoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure. Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks.

General Assembly by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The effort aims to harness the potential of artificial intelligence to advance sustainable development around the world.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is driving the next industrial revolution, offering incredible potential to contribute meaningful progress on sustainable development goals,\u201d said Ned Finkle, vice president of government affairs at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA is committed to empowering communities to use AI to innovate through support for research, education and small- and medium-size enterprises.\u201d\nNVIDIA is joined by Amazon, Anthropic, Apple,\u00a0 Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI in the initiative.\nMembers of the partnership have pledged to provide access to training, compute and other AI tools to drive sustainable development and improved quality of life in developing countries.\nThe PGIAI initiative recognizes that equitable AI requires understanding and respect for the diverse cultures, languages and traditions of the communities where services are provided. With that criteria, PGIAI members will focus on increasing access to AI models, APIs, compute credit and other AI tools, as well as technical training and access to local datasets.\nUnder this partnership, NVIDIA will provide approximately $10 million in free training to universities and developers to help support AI for local solutions and development goals.\nNVIDIA\u2019s global Inception program supports nearly 5,000 startups in emerging economies with technical expertise, go-to-market support, hardware and software discounts and access to free cloud computing credits provided by NVIDIA partners.\nIn 2024, Inception provided access to more than $60 million worth of free cloud compute credits through partners to startups in emerging economies.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Inception program for startups.

However, NVDA stock has shown some vigor again, rising 5% in the last week. After temporarily surpassing the $3 trillion milestone earlier this year, investors are wondering what the future will hold. \u00a0My thesis remains unchanged \u2014 I\u2019m bullish on NVDA shares as an investment due to its clear AI supremacy and exponential growth potential. NVDA\u2019s Long-Term AI-Driven Growth Trajectory Remains Intact It is well known that NVDA is positioned for a long runway of growth with top-notch clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) bulking up on their AI efforts. However, beyond these leading customers, Nvidia\u2019s AI penetration is still rising across all industries, increasing my optimism for NVDA stock. Enterprises across industries and geographies are eager to incorporate AI benefits into their operations. Likewise, NVDA continues to enter into collaborations with top businesses. There\u2019s a reason enterprises are flocking to NVDA for their AI ambitions. Beyond being the leader in AI GPU processors, NVDA provides a complete end-to-end AI infrastructure that supercharges productivity. That\u2019s something that few, if any, of its global AI peers can deliver. NVDA Remains a One-Stop AI Powerhouse with Margin Growth  Another reason for my optimism about NVDA is CEO Jensen Huang\u2018s relentless focus. He is committed to transforming NVDA into a fully AI-driven data center powerhouse that covers all aspects of hardware and software under the NVDA brand. This strategy is a key reason why NVDA can maintain premium pricing for its products, contributing to steady growth in its profit margins. However, critics argue that NVDA\u2019s exceptional revenue and margin growth may not be sustainable. Some members of the investment community are worried about a slowdown in revenue growth over the coming years.  For context, NVDA reported an extraordinary 217% increase in its data center revenues for fiscal 2024. While that growth is expected to moderate to around 130% in 2025, this remains an impressive triple-digit figure, especially considering the strong FY2024 baseline for comparison. Although lower than today\u2019s pace, these are still remarkable growth projections for the future. I view bullish analyst estimates as a reason to remain confident in this AI leader, particularly as the disruptive potential of generative AI is only beginning to unfold.   Story Continues Demand for NVDA\u2019s chips is robust and will boost future revenues in the coming quarters. Therefore, despite some investor concerns, I expect NVDA will continue to maintain its clear AI dominance with an unbeatable competitive moat and best-in-class AI products and services.A Discussion of Nvidia\u2019s Impressive Quarterly EarningsNvidia posted yet another stellar Q2 result on August 28, 2024, driven by accelerated computing and the continued momentum of generative AI.\u00a0Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share\u00a0handily beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.65 per share. The figure came in much higher (+152%) than the Fiscal Q2-2023 figure of $0.27 per share.The company posted a 122% year-over-year revenue growth, delivering $30.04 billion for the three months ending July 31 and surpassing analysts\u2019 projections. Importantly, Data Center revenues, the company\u2019s crown-jewel division, grew 154% year-over-year to $26.3 billion. Additionally NVDA\u2019s adjusted gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 75.1% from 70.1% a year ago. Many investors were apparently hoping for even bigger numbers, and therefore the stock dropped slightly following the Q2 report. Shares then continued a downtrend until they bottomed out on September 6, just above the $100 level.Nvidia\u2019s guidance for the 3rd quarter appeared less promising to investors, with\u00a0revenues\u00a0expected to reach about $32.5 billion. Guidance came in below expectations. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to level off at about 75%, versus 75.15% delivered in Q2.NVDA\u2019s Insider Selling Concerns are OverInsider selling at Nvidia added downward pressure on NVDA shares in recent months. CEO Jensen Huang sold NVDA shares across multiple transactions from June to September, but it\u2019s important to know that those sales were part of a predetermined trading plan adopted in March. This plan allowed Huang to sell up to six million NVDA shares by the end of Q1 2025.Notably, Huang has completed sales of more than $700 million worth of NVDA stock. Despite the significance of these sales, he remains the largest individual shareholder of the company. At last report, Huang held 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships, and 75.3 million shares directly, according to company filings. Combined, Huang controls a ~3.5% stake in the company, with an approximate total of 859 million shares.NVDA Valuation Isn\u2019t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Growth ProwessInvestors may have been hesitant to buy NVDA stock at current levels, pointing to the stock\u2019s extraordinary run as well as due to concerns about the company\u2019s and slowing growth.On the contrary, however, my contention is that NVDA stock is not as expensive as it may seem. Currently, it\u2019s trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 43x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is actually cheaper than some valuation multiples of its peers. For instance, NVDA\u2019s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, Advanced Micro Devices, carries a 46.8x forward P/E. Interestingly, NVDA\u2019s current valuation still reflects a 10% discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 47.3x.Given NVDA\u2019s consistent outperformance and strong growth potential, the current valuation appears reasonable and justified. Any future dip in the stock price could represent a solid buying opportunity, in my opinion, especially considering Nvidia\u2019s immense potential in the rapidly expanding AI market.Is NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?With 39 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus TipRanks rating is a Strong Buy. The\u00a0average Nvidia stock target price of $152.44\u00a0implies potential upside of about 26% for the next year.  Conclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI PotentialDespite recent weakness, NVDA shares have nearly tripled over the past year compared to a rise of about 37% for the Nasdaq 100. The post-earnings sell-off for NVDA stock, in my view, was largely driven by profit-taking. After bottoming near $100, the stock appears to be in recovery mode now.In the near term, I believe ongoing economic and political uncertainties may keep the stock range-bound. However, I view any dips as buying opportunities. I see NVDA as a strong long-term investment given the significant continued potential of AI.Read full\u00a0Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

That\u2019s about the amount of energy needed to power an average American home for a century.\nCollaborating With Industry Leaders\nThe Sanger Institute\u2019s NVIDIA-accelerated sequencing lab can be considered an AI factory, where data comes in and intelligence comes out.\nAI factories are next-generation data centers that host advanced, full-stack accelerated computing platforms for the most computationally intensive tasks.\nAs it explores crucial scientific questions to discover new cancer genes and mutational processes, the Sanger Institute is boosting operational and energy efficiency by using NVIDIA infrastructure for its AI factory.\nIn addition, companies and organizations building AI factories are participating in cross-industry collaborations with leaders like Schneider Electric, an energy management and automation company, to optimize data center designs for running demanding workloads in the most energy-efficient way.\nThe Sanger Institute is collaborating with Schneider Electric to minimize data center downtime and equip the DNA sequencing lab\u2019s data center with uninterruptible power supplies and cooling equipment, among other technologies pivotal to reducing energy consumption.\nAt the NVIDIA GTC conference in March, Schneider Electric announced it\u2019s helping organizations across industries optimize infrastructure by releasing AI data center reference designs tailored for NVIDIA accelerated computing clusters.\nThe reference designs \u2014 built for data processing, engineering simulation, electronic design automation, computer-aided drug design and generative AI \u2014 will focus on high-power distribution, liquid-cooling systems and other aspects of scalable, high-performance, sustainable data centers.\nIn an NYC Climate Week panel this week hosted by The Economist, representatives from Sanger, Schneider Electric and NVIDIA will talk about their work.\nLearn more about sustainable computing and the Sanger Institute\u2019s potentially life-saving work.\nFeatured image courtesy of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Data Science | Energy | Genomics | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Its existing AI monitoring systems are already reducing service delays by up to 20% and train maintenance costs by up to 15% \u2014 and are cutting down energy consumption by decreasing fuel costs at train depots by up to 40%.\nWith real-time analysis using NVIDIA IGX and NVIDIA Holoscan platform for sensor processing, the company aims to further increase these savings.\n\u201cUsing previous digital monitoring systems, it would take a few days to process the data and discover issues that need attention,\u201d said Koji Agatsuma, executive director and chief technology officer of rail vehicles at Hitachi Rail. \u201cIf we can instead conduct real-time prediction using NVIDIA technology, that enables us to avoid service disruptions and significantly improve safety, reliability and operating costs.\u201d\nNVIDIA IGX Powers Real-Time AI Engine\nBuilding on its existing collection of HMAX applications \u2014 which are currently running on data from 8,000 train cars on 2,000 trains \u2014 Hitachi Rail has used NVIDIA IGX and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform to create new accelerated AI applications to help operators monitor train fleets and infrastructure. NVIDIA AI Enterprise offers tools, pretrained models and application frameworks to streamline the development and deployment of production-grade AI applications.\nThese applications, available soon through the HMAX platform, can be used by the company\u2019s international customer base to process huge quantities of data streaming from sensors onboard trains, taken from existing systems or imported from third-party software already in use by the customer.\nIn the U.K., for example, each Hitachi Rail train has sensors that report nearly 50,000 data points as frequently as every fifth of a second. AI infrastructure that keeps pace with this data flow can send train operators timely alerts when a component of a train or rail line needs maintenance. The AI insights can also be accessed through a chatbot interface, helping operators easily identify trends and opportunities to optimize maintenance schedules and more.\n\u201cIf a potential issue isn\u2019t identified and fixed promptly, it can result in a service disruption that causes significant economic loss for our customers and impacts the passengers who rely on these transit lines,\u201d Agatsuma said. \u201cNVIDIA AI infrastructure has enabled us to get immediate alerts on thousands of miles of railway for the first time, which we anticipate will reduce delays and disruptions to passenger travel.\u201d\nDriving Benefits Down the Track\nThe opportunities go beyond monitoring trains and tracks.\nBy mounting cameras atop trains, Hitachi Rail can monitor power lines overhead to identify degrading electric cables and help prevent disruptive failures. Traditionally, it takes up to 10 days to process one day\u2019s worth of video data collected by the train. With NVIDIA-accelerated sensor processing, data can be processed in real time at the edge, sending only relevant information back to operational control centers for analysis and action.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA IGX platform.\u00a0\nMain image courtesy of Hitachi Rail.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Embedded Computing | Hardware | Industrial and Manufacturing | Smart Spaces | Social Impact | Transportation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Studio Drivers undergo extensive testing to ensure seamless compatibility while enhancing features, automating processes and accelerating workflows.\nTwitch Enhanced Broadcasting With HEVC\nThe tradeoff between higher-resolution video quality and reliable streaming is a common issue livestreamers struggle with.\nHigher-quality video provides more enjoyable viewing experiences but can cause streams to buffer for viewers with lower bandwidth or older devices. Streaming lower-bitrate video allows more people to watch content seamlessly but introduces artifacts that can interfere with viewing quality.\nTo address this issue, NVIDIA and Twitch collaborated to develop Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting. The feature adds the capability to send multiple streams \u2014 different versions of encoded video with different resolutions or bitrates \u2014 directly from NVIDIA GeForce RTX-equipped PCs or NVIDIA RTX workstations to deliver the highest-quality video a viewer\u2019s internet connection can handle.\nTwitch supports HEVC (H.265) in the Enhanced Broadcasting closed beta. With the NVIDIA encoder, Twitch streamers get 25% improved efficiency and quality over H.264.\n\nThis means that video will look as if it were being streamed with 25% more bitrate \u2014 in higher quality and with reduced artifacts or encoding errors. The feature is ideal for streaming fast-paced gameplay, enabling cleaner, sharper video with minimal lag.\nBecause all stream versions are generated with a dedicated hardware encoder on GeForce RTX GPUs, the rest of the system\u2019s GPU and CPU are free to focus on running games more smoothly to maximize performance.\n\nLearn how to get started on twitch.com.\nAI-Enhanced Microphones and Webcams\nStreaming is easier than ever with NVIDIA technologies.\nFor starters, PC performance and video quality are incredibly high quality thanks to NVIDIA\u2019s dedicated encoder. And, NVIDIA GPUs include Tensor Cores that efficiently run AI.\nLivestreamers can use AI to enhance their hardware peripherals and devices, which is especially helpful for those who haven\u2019t had the time or resources to assemble extensive audio and video setups.\nNVIDIA Broadcast transforms any home office or dorm room into a home studio \u2014 without the need to purchase specialized equipment. Its AI-powered features include Noise and Echo Removal for microphones, and Virtual Background, Auto Frame, Video Noise Removal and Eye Contact for cameras.\nLivestreamers can download the Broadcast app or access its effects across popular creative apps, including Corsair iCUE, Elgato Camera Hub, OBS, Streamlabs, VTube Studio and Wave Link.\n\nSpotlight the Highlights\nGeForce RTX GPUs make it lightning-fast to edit and enhance video footage on the most popular video editing apps, from Adobe Premiere Pro to CapCut Pro.\nStreamers can use AI-powered, RTX-accelerated features like Enhance Speech to remove noise and improve the quality of dialogue clips; Auto Reframe to automatically size social media videos; and Scene Edit Detection to break up long videos, like B-roll stringouts, into individual clips.\n\nNVIDIA encoders help turbocharge the export process. For those looking for extreme performance, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GPU and up come equipped with dual encoders that can be used in parallel to halve export times on apps like CapCut, the most widely used video editing app on TikTok.\n\nClearer, Sharper Viewing Experiences With RTX Video\nNVIDIA RTX Video \u2014 available exclusively for NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPU owners \u2014 can turn any online and native video into pristine 4K high dynamic range (HDR) content with two technologies: Video Super Resolution and Video HDR.\nRTX Video Super Resolution de-artifacts and upscales streamed video to remove errors that occur during encoding or transport, then runs an AI super-resolution effect. The result is cleaner, sharper video that\u2019s ideal for streaming on platforms like YouTube and Twitch. RTX Video is available in popular web browsers including Opera, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.\n\nMany users have HDR displays, but there isn\u2019t much HDR content online. RTX Video HDR addresses this by turning any standard dynamic range (SDR) video into HDR10 quality that delivers a wider range of brights and darks and makes visuals more vibrant and colorful. This feature is especially helpful when watching dark-lit scenes in video games.\n\nRTX Video HDR requires an RTX GPU connected to an HDR10-compatible monitor or TV. For more information, see the RTX Video FAQ.\nCheck out TwitchCon \u2014 taking place in San Diego and online from Sept. 20-22 \u2014 for the latest streaming updates.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: AI Decoded | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio Driver | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Pandas is a flexible, powerful and popular data analysis and manipulation library for the Python programming language. With cuDF, data scientists can now use their preferred code base without compromising on data processing speed.\nNVIDIA RTX AI hardware and technologies can also deliver data processing speedups. They include powerful GPUs that deliver the computational performance necessary to quickly and efficiently accelerate AI at every level \u2014 from data science workflows to model training and customization on PCs and workstations.\nThe Data Science Bottleneck\nThe most common data format is tabular data, which is organized in rows and columns. Smaller datasets can be managed with spreadsheet tools like Excel, however, datasets and modeling pipelines with tens of millions of rows typically rely on dataframe libraries in programming languages like Python.\nPython is a popular choice for data analysis, primarily because of the pandas library, which features an easy-to-use application programming interface (API). However, as dataset sizes grow, pandas struggles with processing speed and efficiency in CPU-only systems. The library also notoriously struggles with text-heavy datasets, which is an important data type for large language models.\nWhen data requirements outgrow pandas\u2019 capabilities, data scientists are faced with a dilemma: endure slow processing timelines or take the complex and costly step of switching to more efficient but less user-friendly tools.\nAccelerating Preprocessing Pipelines With RAPIDS cuDF\u00a0\nRAPIDS cuDF speeds the popular pandas library up to 100x on RTX-powered AI PCs and workstations.\nWith RAPIDS cuDF, data scientists can use their preferred code base without sacrificing processing speed.\nRAPIDS is an open-source suite of GPU-accelerated Python libraries designed to improve data science and analytics pipelines. cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library that provides a pandas-like API for loading, filtering and manipulating data.\nUsing cuDF\u2019s \u201cpandas accelerator mode,\u201d data scientists can run their existing pandas code on GPUs to take advantage of powerful parallel processing, with the assurance that the code will switch to CPUs when necessary. This interoperability delivers advanced, reliable performance.\nThe latest release of cuDF supports larger datasets and billions of rows of tabular text data. This allows data scientists to use pandas code to preprocess data for generative AI use cases.\nAccelerating Data Science on NVIDIA RTX-Powered AI Workstations and PCs\nAccording to a recent study, 57% of data scientists use local resources such as PCs, desktops or workstations for data science.\nData scientists can achieve significant speedups starting with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU. As datasets grow and processing becomes more memory-intensive, they can use cuDF to deliver up to 100x better performance with NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs in workstations, compared with traditional CPU-based solutions.\nTwo common data science operations \u2014 \u201cjoin\u201d and \u201cgroupby\u201d \u2014 are on the y-axis, while the x-axis shows the time it took to run each operation.\nData scientists can easily get started with RAPIDS cuDF on NVIDIA AI Workbench. This free developer environment manager powered by containers enables data scientists and developers to create, collaborate and migrate AI and data science workloads across GPU systems. Users can get started with several example projects available on the NVIDIA GitHub repository, such as the cuDF AI Workbench project.\ncuDF is also available by default on HP AI Studio, a centralized data science platform designed to help AI developers seamlessly replicate their development environment from workstations to the cloud. This allows them to set up, develop and collaborate on projects without managing multiple environments.\nThe benefits of cuDF on RTX-powered AI PCs and workstations extend beyond raw performance speedups. It also:\n\nSaves time and money with fixed-cost local development on powerful GPUs that replicates seamlessly to on-premises servers or cloud instances.\nEnables faster data processing for quicker iterations, allowing data scientists to experiment, refine and derive insights from datasets at interactive speeds.\nDelivers more impactful data processing for better model outcomes further down the pipeline.\n\nLearn more about RAPIDS cuDF.\nA New Era of Data Science\nAs AI and data science continue to evolve, the ability to rapidly process and analyze massive datasets will become a key differentiator to enable breakthroughs across industries. Whether for developing sophisticated machine learning models, conducting complex statistical analyses or exploring generative AI, RAPIDS cuDF provides the foundation for next-generation data processing.\nNVIDIA is expanding that foundation by adding support for the most popular dataframe tools, including Polars, one of the fastest-growing Python libraries, which significantly accelerates data processing compared with other CPU-only tools out of the box.\nPolars announced this month the open beta of the Polars GPU Engine, powered by RAPIDS cuDF. Polars users can now boost the performance of the already lightning-fast dataframe library by up to 13x.\nEndless Possibilities for Tomorrow\u2019s Engineers With RTX AI\nNVIDIA GPUs \u2014 whether running in university data centers, GeForce RTX laptops or NVIDIA RTX workstations \u2014 are accelerating studies. Students in data science fields and beyond are enhancing their learning experience and gaining hands-on experience with hardware used widely in real-world applications.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations help students level up their studies with AI-powered tools.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

The efficiency gained can translate to better returns for their investments in AI training and fine-tuning, and improved user experiences for AI inference.\nAt the Oracle CloudWorld conference today, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) announced the first zettascale OCI Supercluster, accelerated by the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, to help enterprises train and deploy next-generation AI models using more than 100,000 of NVIDIA\u2019s latest-generation GPUs.\nOCI Superclusters allow customers to choose from a wide range of NVIDIA GPUs and deploy them anywhere: on premises, public cloud and sovereign cloud. Set for availability in the first half of next year, the Blackwell-based systems can scale up to 131,072 Blackwell GPUs with NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NICs for RoCEv2 or NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking to deliver an astounding 2.4 zettaflops of peak AI compute to the cloud. (Read the press release to learn more about OCI Superclusters.)\nAt the show, Oracle also previewed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 liquid-cooled bare-metal instances to help power generative AI applications. The instances are capable of large-scale training with Quantum-2 InfiniBand and real-time inference of trillion-parameter models within the expanded 72-GPU NVIDIA NVLink domain, which can act as a single, massive GPU.\nThis year, OCI will offer NVIDIA HGX H200 \u2014 connecting eight NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs in a single bare-metal instance via NVLink and NVLink Switch, and scaling to 65,536 H200 GPUs with NVIDIA ConnectX-7 NICs over RoCEv2 cluster networking. The instance is available to order for customers looking to deliver real-time inference at scale and accelerate their training workloads. (Read a blog on OCI Superclusters with NVIDIA B200, GB200 and H200 GPUs.)\nOCI also announced general availability of NVIDIA L40S GPU-accelerated instances for midrange AI workloads, NVIDIA Omniverse and visualization. (Read a blog on OCI Superclusters with NVIDIA L40S GPUs.)\nFor single-node to multi-rack solutions, Oracle\u2019s edge offerings provide scalable AI at the edge accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs, even in disconnected and remote locations. For example, smaller-scale deployments with Oracle\u2019s Roving Edge Device v2 will now support up to three NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs.\nCompanies are using NVIDIA-powered OCI Superclusters to drive AI innovation. Foundation model startup Reka, for example, is using the clusters to develop advanced multimodal AI models to develop enterprise agents.\n\u201cReka\u2019s multimodal AI models, built with OCI and NVIDIA technology, empower next-generation enterprise agents that can read, see, hear and speak to make sense of our complex world,\u201d said Dani Yogatama, cofounder and CEO of Reka. \u201cWith NVIDIA GPU-accelerated infrastructure, we can handle very large models and extensive contexts with ease, all while enabling dense and sparse training to scale efficiently at cluster levels.\u201d\nNVIDIA received the 2024 Oracle Technology Solution Partner Award in Innovation for its full-stack approach to innovation.\nAccelerating Generative AI Oracle Database Workloads\nOracle Autonomous Database is gaining NVIDIA GPU support for Oracle Machine Learning notebooks to allow customers to accelerate their data processing workloads on Oracle Autonomous Database.\nAt Oracle CloudWorld, NVIDIA and Oracle are partnering to demonstrate three capabilities that show how the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform could be used today or in the future to accelerate key components of generative AI retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.\nThe first will showcase how NVIDIA GPUs can be used to accelerate bulk vector embeddings directly from within Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless to efficiently bring enterprise data closer to AI. These vectors can be searched using Oracle Database 23ai\u2019s AI Vector Search.\nThe second demonstration will showcase a proof-of-concept prototype that uses NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA cuVS and an Oracle-developed offload framework to accelerate vector graph index generation, which significantly reduces the time needed to build indexes for efficient vector searches.\nThe third demonstration illustrates how NVIDIA NIM, a set of easy-to-use inference microservices, can boost generative AI performance for text generation and translation use cases across a range of model sizes and concurrency levels.\nTogether, these new Oracle Database capabilities and demonstrations highlight how NVIDIA GPUs can be used to help enterprises bring generative AI to their structured and unstructured data housed in or managed by an Oracle Database.\nSovereign AI Worldwide\nNVIDIA and Oracle are collaborating to deliver sovereign AI infrastructure worldwide, helping address the data residency needs of governments and enterprises.\nBrazil-based startup Wide Labs trained and deployed Amazonia IA, one of the first large language models for Brazilian Portuguese, using NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and the NVIDIA NeMo framework in OCI\u2019s Brazilian data centers to help ensure data sovereignty.\n\u201cDeveloping a sovereign LLM allows us to offer clients a service that processes their data within Brazilian borders, giving Amaz\u00f4nia a unique market position,\u201d said Nelson Leoni, CEO of Wide Labs. \u201cUsing the NVIDIA NeMo framework, we successfully trained Amaz\u00f4nia IA.\u201d\nIn Japan, Nomura Research Institute, a leading global provider of consulting services and system solutions, is using OCI\u2019s Alloy infrastructure with NVIDIA GPUs to enhance its financial AI platform with LLMs operating in accordance with financial regulations and data sovereignty requirements.\nCommunication and collaboration company Zoom will be using NVIDIA GPUs in OCI\u2019s Saudi Arabian data centers to help support compliance with local data requirements.\nAnd geospatial modeling company RSS-Hydro is demonstrating how its flood mapping platform \u2014 built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and powered by L40S GPUs on OCI \u2014 can use digital twins to simulate flood impacts in Japan\u2019s Kumamoto region, helping mitigate the impact of climate change.\nThese customers are among numerous nations and organizations building and deploying domestic AI applications powered by NVIDIA and OCI, driving economic resilience through sovereign AI infrastructure.\nEnterprise-Ready AI With NVIDIA and Oracle\nEnterprises can accelerate task automation on OCI by deploying NVIDIA software such as NIM microservices and NVIDIA cuOpt with OCI\u2019s scalable cloud solutions. These solutions enable enterprises to quickly adopt generative AI and build agentic workflows for complex tasks like code generation and route optimization.\nNVIDIA cuOpt, NIM, RAPIDS and more are included in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, available on the Oracle Cloud Marketplace.\nLearn More at Oracle CloudWorld\u00a0\nJoin NVIDIA at Oracle CloudWorld 2024 to learn how the companies\u2019 collaboration is bringing AI and accelerated data processing to the world\u2019s organizations.\nRegister to the event to watch sessions, see demos and join Oracle and NVIDIA for the solution keynote, \u201cUnlock AI Performance with NVIDIA\u2019s Accelerated Computing Platform\u201d (SOL3866), on Wednesday, Sept. 11, in Las Vegas.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | Generative AI | Hardware | Networking | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA cuOpt | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | NVLink | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s a good time to take stock of recent gains in energy efficiency in fields from manufacturing and cloud computing to healthcare and beyond.\nFoxconn Saves Energy With Digital Twins\nFoxconn, the world\u2019s largest electronics manufacturer, is using accelerated computing and AI to build a digital twin of a new factory in Mexico, where it will train its robots and define production processes.\n\u201cOur digital twin will guide us to new levels of automation and industrial efficiency, saving time, cost and energy,\u201d said Young Liu, chairman of Foxconn, which estimates a 30% annual energy savings.\nIt\u2019s the latest company to employ software from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio including Teamcenter and NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing 3D workflows and applications based on OpenUSD.\n\n\u201cWe will revolutionize how products and experiences are designed, manufactured and serviced,\u201d said Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG. \u201cIn collaboration with NVIDIA, we will bring accelerated computing, generative AI and Omniverse integration across the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio.\u201d\nSiemens and NVIDIA executives will talk about their sustainability efforts in a Sept. 25 Climate Week event moderated by TIME magazine.\nCloud Services Increase Efficiency\u00a0\u00a0\nCloud computing services are also racking up advances in energy efficiency.\nAn e-commerce website uses NVIDIA AI to connect hundreds of millions of shoppers a day to the products they need. After migrating from CPUs to GPUs, it achieved significantly lower latency with a 33x speedup and nearly 12x energy-efficiency improvement.\nA popular video conferencing application captions several hundred thousand virtual meetings an hour. By switching from CPUs to GPUs, throughput increased from just three to 200 queries per second \u2014 a 66x speedup and 25x energy-efficiency improvement.\nTo meet sustainability goals, service providers and their customers are increasingly turning to renewable energy sources.\nFor example, Equinix is the first global data center provider to publish a science-based climate neutral target and 100% renewable energy goal by 2030. Currently, renewables address 96% of the energy it uses, giving customers access to technologies such as NVIDIA DGX systems for sustainable, private AI.\nThe DGX systems use NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, which offer up to 4x more energy efficiency than previous models. Equinix employs advanced liquid cooling to reduce power and water consumption.\nThe evolution of the data center will be discussed at a Climate Week event hosted by NVIDIA and Crusoe Energy Systems, a company that builds and operates clean computing infrastructure.\nDecoding Cancer While Saving Energy\nHealthcare companies are adopting AI and accelerated computing to help them understand and treat diseases.\nFor instance, the Wellcome Sanger Institute runs one of the largest genome sequencing facilities in the world. Its cancer program sequences and analyzes tens of thousands of cancer samples.\nUsing NVIDIA Parabricks software on NVIDIA DGX systems reduces its run times by 1.6x, capital costs by 24x and energy consumption by up to 42x. That amounts to potential savings of $1 million and 1,000 megawatt-hours a year.\nThe latest version of Parabricks, released in mid-September, can further enhance such work.\n\u201cThe Sanger Institute handles hundreds of thousands of samples annually,\u201d said Jingwei Wang, a principal software developer at Wellcome Sanger in a profile describing its work. \u201cWith NVIDIA GPUs and Parabricks accelerated genomic analysis software, we will save considerable time, cost and energy analyzing them.\u201d\nExpanding the Sustainability Ecosystem\u00a0\nIn addition to enabling efficiency gains for customers, NVIDIA is nurturing a broad ecosystem focused on sustainability.\nFor example, a collaboration with the United Nations announced last year has already trained more than 14,000 data scientists on how to design AI models for early flood detection.\nEntrepreneurs increasingly see opportunities here, too.\nSustainable Futures, an initiative of the NVIDIA Inception program, now includes more than a thousand startups pioneering new paths to energy efficiency. They apply a mix of AI, accelerated computing and open platforms like NVIDIA Earth-2 to speed climate and weather predictions.\nSavings Span Global Industries\nThese examples provide a taste of what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s to come.\n\u201cThe generative AI revolution is poised to impact every industry and enable a new era of productivity and sustainability by unlocking efficiencies and resource optimization across sectors,\u201d said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in the company\u2019s latest sustainability report.\nIt\u2019s a reality independent analysts recognize.\n\u201cEven if the predictions that data centers will soon account for 4% of global energy consumption become a reality, AI is having a major impact on reducing the remaining 96% of energy consumption,\u201d said a report from Lisbon Council Research, a nonprofit formed in 2003 that studies economic and social issues.\n45,000x Efficiency Gain in AI Inference\nNVIDIA works continuously to expand and optimize its full stack of technologies to enable greater efficiencies.\nFrom 2016 to 2025 when the NVIDIA Blackwell platform will ship in volume, NVIDIA AI computing will have achieved approximately 10,000x more energy efficiency for AI training and inference.\nTo put that into perspective, if the efficiency of cars improved as much as NVIDIA has advanced the efficiency of AI on its accelerated computing platform, they\u2019d get 280,000 miles per gallon. That\u2019s enough to drive to the moon, and back, on less than a gallon of gasoline.\nSpeedups over CPUs from 20x to 160x \u2014 and their associated energy savings \u2014 are available across the gamut of workloads from data processing to computer vision the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform serves. That\u2019s why accelerated computing is often called sustainable computing.\nExpanding Climate Week\u2019s Agenda\nRallying support for sustainability, NVIDIA and partners are taking part in a handful of other Climate Week events.\nThey include a Climate AI Summit with Salesforce and a Climate Science Fair with about 30 startups, many using NVIDIA technologies. The Science Fair will give attendees an up-close look at how Earth-2 enables simulation on a planetary scale.\nIt\u2019s another small step toward helping people understand how to use AI and accelerated computing to address climate change.\n\u201cAccelerated computing is how to meet the massive demand for computing power sustainably and cost-effectively,\u201d Huang said.\nLearn more about how NVIDIA\u2019s technologies support corporate sustainability.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate SustainabilityTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Corporate Responsibility | Customer Stories | Digital Twin | Events | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.An antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice focusing on Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance as the hardware company of choice is escalating, reports Bloomberg. The outlet reports that Nvidia and other companies have received legally binding requests for information as its sources say regulators are investigating whether Nvidia is \u201cmaking it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don\u2019t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips.\u201d\u201cNvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them.

Smith16 Sep 202410 min read\n        David Plunkert\n    It\u2019s hard to overstate Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance. Founded in 1993, \n\tNvidia first made its mark in the then-new field of graphics processing units (GPUs) for personal computers. But it\u2019s the company\u2019s AI chips, not PC graphics hardware, that vaulted Nvidia into the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. It turns out that Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are also excellent for AI. As a result, its stock is more than 15 times as valuable as it was at the start of 2020; revenues have ballooned from roughly US $12 billion in its 2019 fiscal year to $60 billion in 2024; and the AI powerhouse\u2019s leading-edge chips are as scarce, and desired, as water in a desert.\n\n\tAccess to \n\tGPUs \u201chas become so much of a worry for AI researchers, that the researchers think about this on a day-to-day basis. Because otherwise they can\u2019t have fun, even if they have the best model,\u201d says Jennifer Prendki, head of AI data at Google DeepMind. Prendki is less reliant on Nvidia than most, as Google has its own homespun AI infrastructure. But other tech giants, like Microsoft and Amazon, are among Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers, and continue to buy its GPUs as quickly as they\u2019re produced. Exactly who gets them and why is the subject of an antitrust investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to press\u00a0reports.\n\n\tNvidia\u2019s AI dominance, like the explosion of machine learning itself, is a recent turn of events. But it\u2019s rooted in the company\u2019s decades-long effort to establish GPUs as general computing hardware that\u2019s useful for many tasks besides rendering graphics. That effort spans not only the company\u2019s GPU architecture, which evolved to include \u201ctensor cores\u201d adept at accelerating AI workloads, but also, critically, its software platform, called \n\tCuda, to help developers take advantage of the hardware.\n\n\t \u201cThey made sure every computer-science major coming out of university is trained up and knows how to \n\tprogram CUDA,\u201d says Matt Kimball, principal data-center analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cThey provide the tooling and the training, and they spend a lot of money on research.\u201d\n\n\tReleased in 2006, CUDA helps developers use an Nvidia GPU\u2019s many cores. That\u2019s proved essential for accelerating highly parallelized compute tasks, including modern generative AI. Nvidia\u2019s success in building the CUDA ecosystem makes its hardware the path of least resistance for AI development. Nvidia chips might be in short supply, but the only thing more difficult to find than AI hardware is experienced AI developers\u2014and many are familiar with CUDA.\n\n\tThat gives Nvidia a deep, broad moat with which to defend its business, but that doesn\u2019t mean it lacks competitors ready to storm the castle, and their tactics vary widely. While decades-old companies like \n\tAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel are looking to use their own GPUs to rival Nvidia, upstarts like Cerebras and SambaNova have developed radical chip architectures that drastically improve the efficiency of generative AI training and inference. These are the competitors most likely to challenge Nvidia.\nNvidia\u2019s ArmoryWhile Nvidia has several types of GPUs deployed, the big guns found in data centers are the H100 and H200. As soon as the end of 2024, they will be joined by the B200, which nearly quadruples the H100\u2019s performance on a per-GPU basis.Sources: Nvidia, MLPerf inferencing v4.1 results for Llama2-70B\nAMD: The other GPU maker\nPro: AMD GPUs are convincing Nvidia alternatives\nCon: Software ecosystem can\u2019t rival Nvidia\u2019s CUDA\n\n\tAMD has battled Nvidia in the graphics-chip arena for nearly two decades. It\u2019s been, at times, a lopsided fight. When it comes to graphics, AMD\u2019s GPUs have rarely beaten Nvidia\u2019s in sales or mindshare. Still, AMD\u2019s hardware has its strengths. The company\u2019s broad GPU portfolio extends from integrated graphics for laptops to AI-focused data-center GPUs with over 150 billion transistors. The company was also an early supporter and adopter of \n\thigh-bandwidth memory (HBM), a form of memory that\u2019s now essential to the world\u2019s most advanced GPUs.\n\n\t\u201cIf you look at the hardware\u2026it stacks up favorably\u201d to Nvidia, says Kimball, referring to AMD\u2019s Instinct MI325X, a competitor of Nvidia\u2019s H100. \u201cAMD did a fantastic job laying that chip out.\u201d\n\n\tThe MI325X, slated to launch by the end of the year, has over 150 billion transistors and 288 gigabytes of high-bandwidth memory, though real-world results remain to be seen. The MI325X\u2019s predecessor, the \n\tMI300X, earned praise from Microsoft, which deploys AMD hardware, including the MI300X, to handle some ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 services. Meta and Dell have also deployed the MI300X, and Meta used the chips in parts of the development of its latest large language model, Llama 3.1.\n\n\tThere\u2019s still a hurdle for AMD to leap: software. AMD offers an open-source platform, \n\tROCm, to help developers program its GPUs, but it\u2019s less popular than CUDA. AMD is aware of this weakness, and in July 2024, it agreed to buy Europe\u2019s largest private AI lab, Silo AI, which has experience doing large-scale AI training using ROCm and AMD hardware. AMD has also plans to purchase ZT Systems, a company with expertise in data-center infrastructure, to help the company serve customers looking to deploy its hardware at scale. Building a rival to CUDA is no small feat, but AMD is certainly trying.Intel: Software successPro:Gaudi 3 AI accelerator shows strong performance\nCon: Next big AI chip doesn\u2019t arrive until late 2025\n\n\tIntel\u2019s challenge is the opposite of AMD\u2019s.\n\n\tWhile Intel lacks an exact match for Nvidia\u2019s CUDA and AMD\u2019s ROCm, it launched an open-source unified programming platform, \n\tOneAPI, in 2018. Unlike CUDA and ROCm, OneAPI spans multiple categories of hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. So it can help developers accelerate AI tasks (and many others) on any Intel hardware. \u201cIntel\u2019s got a heck of a software ecosystem it can turn on pretty easily,\u201d says Kimball.\n\n\tHardware, on the other hand, is a weakness, at least when compared to Nvidia and AMD. Intel\u2019s Gaudi AI accelerators, the fruit of Intel\u2019s \n\t2019 acquisition of AI hardware startup Habana Labs, have made headway, and the latest, Gaudi 3, offers performance that\u2019s competitive with Nvidia\u2019s H100.\n\n\tHowever, it\u2019s unclear precisely what Intel\u2019s next hardware release will look like, which has caused some concern. \u201cGaudi 3 is very capable,\u201d says \n\tPatrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy. But as of July 2024 \u201cthere is no Gaudi 4,\u201d he says.\n\n\tIntel instead plans to pivot to an ambitious chip, code-named Falcon Shores, with a tile-based modular architecture that combines Intel \n\tx86 CPU cores and Xe GPU cores; the latter are part of Intel\u2019s recent push into graphics hardware. Intel has yet to reveal details about Falcon Shores\u2019 architecture and performance, though, and it\u2019s not slated for release until late 2025.\nCerebras: Bigger is betterPro: Wafer-scale chips offer strong performance and memory per chip\nCon: Applications are niche due to size and cost\n\n\tMake no mistake: AMD and Intel are by far the most credible challengers to Nvidia. They share a history of designing successful chips and building programming platforms to go alongside them. But among the smaller, less proven players, one stands out: \n\tCerebras.\n\n\tThe company, which specializes in AI for supercomputers, made waves in 2019 with the Wafer Scale Engine, a gigantic, wafer-size piece of silicon packed with 1.2 trillion transistors. The most recent iteration, Wafer Scale Engine 3, ups the ante to 4 trillion transistors. For comparison, Nvidia\u2019s largest and newest GPU, the \n\tB200, has \u201cjust\u201d 208 billion transistors. The computer built around this wafer-scale monster, Cerebras\u2019s CS-3, is at the heart of the Condor Galaxy 3, which will be an 8-exaflop AI supercomputer made up of 64 CS-3s. G42, an Abu Dhabi\u2013based conglomerate that hopes to train tomorrow\u2019s leading-edge large language models, will own the system.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a little more niche, not as general purpose,\u201d says \n\tStacy Rasgon, senior analyst at Bernstein Research. \u201cNot everyone is going to buy [these computers]. But they\u2019ve got customers, like the [United States] Department of Defense, and [the Condor Galaxy 3] supercomputer.\u201d\n\n\tCerebras\u2019s WSC-3 isn\u2019t going to challenge Nvidia, AMD, or Intel hardware in most situations; it\u2019s too large, too costly, and too specialized. But it could give Cerebras a unique edge in supercomputers, because no other company designs chips on the scale of the WSE.\nSambaNova: A transformer for transformersPro: Configurable architecture helps developers squeeze efficiency from AI models\nCon: Hardware still has to prove relevance to mass market\nSambaNova, founded in 2017, is another chip-design company tackling AI training with an unconventional chip architecture. Its flagship, the SN40L, has what the company calls a \u201creconfigurable dataflow architecture\u201d composed of tiles of memory and compute resources. The links between these tiles can be altered on the fly to facilitate the quick movement of data for large neural networks.\n\n\tPrendki believes such customizable silicon could prove useful for training large language models, because AI developers can optimize the hardware for different models. No other company offers that capability, she says.\n\n\tSambaNova is also scoring wins with \n\tSambaFlow, the software stack used alongside the SN40L. \u201cAt the infrastructure level, SambaNova is doing a good job with the platform,\u201d says Moorhead. SambaFlow can analyze machine learning models and help developers reconfigure the SN40L to accelerate the model\u2019s performance. SambaNova still has a lot to prove, but its customers include SoftBank and Analog Devices.\nGroq: Form for functionPro: Excellent AI inference performance\nCon: Application currently limited to inference\n\n\tYet another company with a unique spin on AI hardware is \n\tGroq. Groq\u2019s approach is focused on tightly pairing memory and compute resources to accelerate the speed with which a large language model can respond to prompts.\n\n\t\u201cTheir architecture is very memory based. The memory is tightly coupled to the processor. You need more nodes, but the price per token and the performance is nuts,\u201d says Moorhead. The \u201ctoken\u201d is the basic unit of data a model processes; in an LLM, it\u2019s typically a word or portion of a word. Groq\u2019s performance is even more impressive, he says, given that its chip, called the\n\t Language Processing Unit Inference Engine, is made using GlobalFoundries\u2019 14-nanometer technology, several generations behind the TSMC technology that makes the Nvidia H100.\n\n\tIn July, Groq posted a demonstration of its chip\u2019s inference speed, which can exceed 1,250 tokens per second running \n\tMeta\u2019s Llama 3 8-billion parameter LLM. That beats even SambaNova\u2019s demo, which can exceed 1,000 tokens per second.\nQualcomm: Power is everythingPro: Broad range of chips with AI capabilities\nCon: Lacks large, leading-edge chips for AI training\nQualcomm, well known for the Snapdragon system-on-a-chip that powers popular Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and OnePlus 12, is a giant that can stand toe-to-toe with AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.\n\n\tBut unlike those peers, the company is focusing its AI strategy more on AI inference and energy efficiency for specific tasks. \n\tAnton Lokhmotov, a founding member of the AI benchmarking organization MLCommons and CEO of Krai, a company that specializes in AI optimization, says Qualcomm has significantly improved the inference of the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 servers in an important benchmark test. The servers\u2019 performance increased from 180 to 240 samples-per-watt in ResNet-50, an image-classification benchmark, using \u201cessentially the same server hardware,\u201d Lokhmotov notes.\n\n\tEfficient AI inference is also a boon on devices that need to handle AI tasks locally without reaching out to the cloud, says Lokhmotov. Case in point: Microsoft\u2019s \n\tCopilot Plus PCs. Microsoft and Qualcomm partnered with laptop makers, including Dell, HP, and Lenovo, and the first Copilot Plus laptops with Qualcomm chips hit store shelves in July. Qualcomm also has a strong presence in smartphones and tablets, where its Snapdragon chips power devices from Samsung, OnePlus, and Motorola, among others.\n\n\tQualcomm is an important player in AI for driver assist and self-driving platforms, too. In early 2024, Hyundai\u2019s Mobius division announced a partnership to use the \n\tSnapdragon Ride platform, a rival to Nvidia\u2019s Drive platform, for advanced driver-assist systems.\nThe Hyperscalers: Custom brains for brawnPros: Vertical integration focuses design\nCons: Hyperscalers may prioritize their own needs and uses first\n\n\tHyperscalers\u2014cloud-computing giants that deploy hardware at vast scales\u2014are synonymous with Big Tech. Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all want to deploy AI hardware as quickly as possible, both for their own use and for their cloud-computing customers. To accelerate that, they\u2019re all designing chips in-house.\n\n\tGoogle began investing in AI processors much earlier than its competitors: The search giant\u2019s Tensor Processing Units, first announced in 2015, now power most of its AI infrastructure. The sixth generation of TPUs, \n\tTrillium, was announced in May and is part of Google\u2019s AI Hypercomputer, a cloud-based service for companies looking to handle AI tasks.\n\n\tPrendki says Google\u2019s TPUs give the company an advantage in pursuing AI opportunities. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I don\u2019t have to think too hard about where I get my chips,\u201d she says. Access to TPUs doesn\u2019t entirely eliminate the supply crunch, though, as different Google divisions still need to share resources.\n\n\tAnd Google is no longer alone. Amazon has two in-house chips, \n\tTrainium and Inferentia, for training and inference, respectively. Microsoft has Maia, Meta has MTIA, and Apple is supposedly developing silicon to handle AI tasks in its cloud infrastructure.\n\n\tNone of these compete directly with Nvidia, as hyperscalers don\u2019t sell hardware to customers. But they do sell access to their hardware through cloud services, like \n\tGoogle\u2019s AI Hypercomputer, Amazon\u2019s AWS, and Microsoft\u2019s Azure. In many cases, hyperscalers offer services running on their own in-house hardware as an option right alongside services running on hardware from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel; Microsoft is thought to be Nvidia\u2019s largest customer.\nDavid PlunkertChinese chips: An opaque future \n\tAnother category of competitor is born not of technical needs but of geopolitical realities. \n\tThe United States has imposed restrictions on the export of AI hardware that prevents chipmakers from selling their latest, most-capable chips to Chinese companies. In response, Chinese companies are designing homegrown AI chips.\n\n\tHuawei is a leader. The company\u2019s \n\tAscend 910B AI accelerator, designed as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s H100, is in production at Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., a Shanghai-based foundry partially owned by the Chinese government. However, yield issues at SMIC have reportedly constrained supply. Huawei is also selling an \u201cAI-in-a-box\u201d solution, meant for Chinese companies looking to build their own AI infrastructure on-premises.\n\n\tTo get around the U.S. export control rules, Chinese industry could turn to alternative technologies. For example, Chinese researchers have made headway in photonic chips that use light, instead of electric charge, to perform calculations. \u201cThe advantage of a beam of light is you can cross one [beam with] another,\u201d says Prendki. \u201cSo it reduces constraints you\u2019d normally have on a silicon chip, where you can\u2019t cross paths. You can make the circuits more complex, for less money.\u201d It\u2019s still very early days for photonic chips, but Chinese investment in the area could accelerate its development.\nRoom for more\n\n\tIt\u2019s clear that Nvidia has no shortage of competitors. It\u2019s equally clear that none of them will challenge\u2014never mind defeat\u2014Nvidia in the next few years. Everyone interviewed for this article agreed that Nvidia\u2019s dominance is currently unparalleled, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will crowd out competitors forever.\n\n\t\u201cListen, the market wants choice,\u201d says Moorhead. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine AMD not having 10 or 20 percent market share, Intel the same, if we go to 2026. Typically, the market likes three, and there we have three reasonable competitors.\u201d Kimball says the hyperscalers, meanwhile, could challenge Nvidia as they transition more AI services to in-house hardware.\n\n\t\tAnd then there\u2019s the wild cards. Cerebras, SambaNova, and Groq are the leaders in a very long list of startups looking to nibble away at Nvidia with novel solutions. They\u2019re joined by dozens of others, including \n\td-Matrix, Untether, Tenstorrent, and Etched, all pinning their hopes on new chip architectures optimized for generative AI. It\u2019s likely many of these startups will falter, but perhaps the next Nvidia will emerge from the survivors.

These can all be combined into a workflow on AWS that allows scientists and engineers to explore potentially millions of possible scenarios at a fraction of the cost of traditional numerical weather simulations.\nBackground\nBoth traditional weather forecasting organizations and technology companies are evolving their approach to forecasting. Machine learning approaches hold significant promise.\n\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 forecasting weather with any level of accuracy is a computationally intense exercise. New techniques drawn from deep-learning provide hope that these simulations can be sped up dramatically. This figure shows the ensemble mean of 10meter zonal winds around the globe\n\nCurrently, we\u2019re seeing the impact of these models as a viable tool in combination with traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to perform downstream tasks: like electricity load demand forecasting or wind energy production. In most cases, they\u2019re reducing time to solution and costs.\nIn this post, we\u2019ll show how AI approaches to weather prediction can be used in tandem with renewable energy production models, specifically to forecast the energy output over the course of a week. This approach is a viable and cost-effective option compared to traditional NWP solutions and can help scientists and engineers explore parameter space more rapidly.\nWhy are rapid tools for energy forecasting important?\nGlobal medium-range weather forecasting plays a vital role in decisions that impact our everyday lives. Historically, NWP uses high performance computing (HPC) to solve equations that govern the physics of weather. Calculations like this are a costly and time-consuming activity and are typically repeated several times a day or even every hour. Forecasters initialize the numerical models with observation and measurement data to predict weather forecasts.\nNWP methods have evolved consistently, gradually improving the accuracy of weather forecasts, but there\u2019s an element of uncertainty in all predictions including weather predictions. This is because weather is a chaotic dynamical system, highly sensitive to initial conditions.\nFor medium-range forecasts, two factors can lead to a decrease in accuracy as the forecast lead-time increases:\n\nUncertainty in initial conditions: measurement data for current weather conditions has an element of error and there are large regions without accurate monitoring stations.\nApproximation error inherent in the model assumptions: numerical weather models (whether physics-based or data-driven) include an element of error due to system approximations \u2013 for example by not capturing the physics and spatial-temporal scales necessary to encapsulate the system behavior.\n\nThese uncertainties amplify as the forecast window increases. Quantifying uncertainty in weather forecasting is extremely important given the potential it offers to minimize the socio-economic impact of extreme weather patterns through better planning. One way to reduce the uncertainty is to combine the results of multiple forecasts \u2013 a technique known as ensembles.\nRunning ensemble forecasts usually means running additional NWP calculations at an increased cost. Large ensembles with 100s to 1000s of members using NWP models bring modern supercomputers to their limits. However, ML weather models, like those available through Earth2Studio, make it possible to run ensembles on a small number of NVIDIA GPUs. Using AWS services, we will show you how to build a single workflow to integrate ensemble weather forecasts with downstream applications.\n\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 A 100-ensemble forecast of surface windspeed (eastward (u10m) and (northward) v10m component). Figure shows the standard deviation across a 7-day forecast demonstrating the uncertainty in forecasting using FourCastNet with Gaussian noise distribution\n\nHow weather forecasts can use machine learning\nRecent advances in machine learning for modeling various physical phenomena (including weather forecasting) have provided a new option to augment the traditional approach of NWP.\nThe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has made the atmospheric re-analysis of the global data (ERA5) available from 1940 to present. Consequently, the community has been able to create multiple ML models with benchmarks available via WeatherBench.\nIn this post, we will couple FourCastNet (available through Earth2Studio from NVIDIA) with a medium-fidelity wind farm simulation model available in PyWake.\u00a0NVIDIA Earth-2 is a full-stack, open platform that accelerates climate and weather predictions with interactive, AI-augmented, high-resolution simulations. FourCastNet provides a global medium range prediction at 0.25-degree resolution.\nNVIDIA trained the model on a subset of ERA5 reanalysis data gathered from 1980 to 2015. FourCastNet inferencing can be completed in seconds on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than traditional NWP simulations, thereby reducing cost and time to solution. Specifically, this allows researchers to run a significant number of ensemble calculations to reduce the uncertainty and combine with NWP simulations to further reduce the likelihood of error. This ultimately improves medium-range probabilistic forecasting and augments existing NWP models. The Earth-2 platform provides forecast models like FourCastNet, GraphCast, DLWP and easy-to-use workflows to apply these models for specific use cases.\nWind farm modeling\u00a0application\nThe windIO framework was created by the International Energy Agency (IEA) \u201cwind task 37\u201d team and defines the inputs and outputs for systems engineering multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) of wind turbines and plants. The benchmark provides an industry-standard open-sourced layout to develop best practices in system design and help with designing tools and methods related to research in wind energy. The workflow discussed in this post can be applied to any wind farm design choice that the reader may wish to experiment with, but the results presented here are from the open-source model available in IEA-37.\nTo calculate the energy output of the IEA-37 windfarm benchmark, an initial windspeed is necessary. This windspeed was calculated by inference from the NVIDIA Earth-2 platform. The energy of the windfarm was calculated by using the analytical wake model with turbulence that\u2019s part of the open-source PyWake project. For this post, we simulated passive yaw control without consideration of wake steering and associated phenomena. The workflow we\u2019re presenting here is agnostic to the underlying simulation environment. This will enable you to experiment with alternative methodologies, supported by AWS infrastructure that will elastically scale to meet your computing requirements.\nThe tools provided by AWS and NVIDIA enable the rapid forecasting of energy production, opening new ways of approaching this challenge. We can \u2013 for example \u2013 integrate AI weather predictions models together with well-known energy production modeling tools such as PyWake into a single workflow. The results of this coupling can aid in planning the power grid optimization strategies at local and national levels, both during the design process and in production to calculate energy output.\nCoupling ML weather prediction with wind farm energy output\nEarth2Studio provides pretrained models and workflows to execute AI weather forecasts as part of the NVIDIA Earth-2 platform. FourCastNet, one of the models supported by Earth2Studio, predicts wind speed and other meteorological variables like geopotential height, temperature, and humidity. Using FourCastNet in the ensemble workflow implemented in Earth2Studio, we can run multiple inferences to get a statistical distribution for the required set of variables.\nThe inference pipeline requires initial conditions and Earth2Studio supports multiple data sources for initial conditions. For this post we used the\u00a0Global Forecast System\u00a0(GFS) model by NOAA for our initial conditions. The GFS data sets are available as part of the\u00a0Registry of Open Data on AWS. We use the initial conditions from the GFS model to initialize the inference model of FourCastNet.\nInferences are calculated using the FourCastNet model for five different wind farm locations using the assumption that each wind farm contains 64 turbines. We used the longitude and latitude of the windfarm locations as the input parameters for forecasting the windspeed. We forecasted the windspeed across a 7.5-day period (this implies 30 inferences at six-hour intervals). We repeated the inferences for 1,000 ensemble runs at each location by adding Gaussian random field for spatially uncorrelated noise \u2013 one of the several noise-generation schemes offered by Earth2Studio.\nWe ran a total of 150,000 inferences for five different wind farm locations using 25 NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs in well under an hour. This is significantly faster and cheaper than running NWP simulation and scaled to many more thousands of inferences through AWS Batch with ease. We extracted the u100m and v100m variables from the inferences. u100m and v100m refer to eastward and northward components of the wind respectfully at 100m height \u2013 these allow for the calculation of wind magnitude at a given direction and time.\nThe outputs of the inference from FourCastNet, specifically the windspeed, are then used as input to PyWake to calculate the energy of a given wind farm, with a further subdivision in time to 36-minute intervals using Weibull sampling, to account for variations in wind velocity across a 6-hour period.\nInfrastructure\nWe used Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, and scaled these using AWS Batch. Specifically, we used g5.4xlarge instances because the instances have 16GB of GPU memory that is sufficient to run the inference, and this provides a balance between sufficient computing power and a cost-effective solution.\nFigure 3 shows the infrastructure we deployed to perform the inference calculations.\n\n\nFigure 3 An architecture diagram to couple ML inferences running on AWS EC2 GPU instances powered by NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPUs through AWS Batch and coupled with CPU architectures for wind-farm simulations. The workflow is orchestrated by the TwinGraph library.\n\nResults\nPredicting energy output using PyWake requires windspeed at a given location and height. Traditionally, NWP simulations calculated this.\nFigure 4 shows the forecasted total energy production for 5 offshore wind farms. The forecast is for a 7.5-day period, initialized with data from the GFS model on the 20th of May 2024. We used the FourCastNet model to generate an ensemble of wind speeds by adding a Gaussian random field for spatially uncorrelated noise.\nThe weather system is representative of a chaotic dynamical system where small changes to initial conditions result in significant deviation over time, and you can see this in Figure 4 with the energy calculations as they progress.\n\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Energy production of 5 wind farms across the globe calculated for 7.5 days. Each line corresponds to one inference run for wind speed and used as the input for wind energy calculations using PyWake.\n\nBenefits for users\nWe showed you in this post how you can combine ML weather inferences with traditional simulations such as wind farm energy production in a cost-efficient and rapid manner. We showed how you can integrate the entire hypothesis testing into a single event-driven workflow thanks to AWS Batch, TwinGraph, and NVIDIA Earth-2.\nWe could improve prediction accuracies by incorporating other ML models for weather forecasting and higher fidelity windfarm simulations. Thanks to the efficient tooling, users can incorporate their own AI weather prediction models and simulation frameworks. The workflow can also be extended to predict the supply and demand for resources for a longer range \u2013 such as 14 days.\nNVIDIA also plans to extend Earth-2 utilities and optimized pipelines for scaling the workflows on NVIDIA GPUs and to make them available for enterprise production use under the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform,\u00a0available in AWS Marketplace.\nThis approach still requires further development to be applicable to industry in a production setting, but demonstrates the potential of integrating ML techniques for weather with physics-based simulations.\n\n\n\n\n         TAGS: \n        AWS Batch, EFA, Elastic Fabric Adapter, HPC, Machine Learning, ML, Research Computing, Scientific Computing, simulations, Sustainability, visualization, Weather\n\n\n\n\n\nSatheesh Maheswaran\nSatheesh has over 18 years of experience in the domain of scientific computing with a specific focus on simulation and data analysis across industrial and academic environments.

Thierer \nBiden\u2019s Move Against Nvidia Is a Gift to China\nRecent U.S. antitrust actions against the newly ascendant tech company only serve Beijing\u2019s geopolitical goals.\n\n\n\n          /\n            Politics and law, Technology and Innovation \n\nSeptember 16, 2024\n/ Share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ Eye on the News\n/\n                                  Politics and law,                  Technology and Innovation \n\n\nSep 16 2024\n/ Share\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s rise to prominence in high-performance computing is a near-perfect embodiment of the American dream. Three friends, including Taiwanese immigrant Jensen Huang, get fed-up with life at a big computer firm and decide to risk everything to compete in the crowded field of computing hardware. They hatch their plan over a meal at Denny\u2019s in 1993, because Huang worked as a busboy at one of their diners as a youth. Huang himself thinks their pitch is an \u201cunfundable idea\u201d with a \u201c0% chance of success.\u201d After they find funding anyway, the new firm faces numerous setbacks and barely survives. It then roars back, eventually becoming a $3 trillion company now driving the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and the U.S. stock market\u2019s record-setting gains.\nYet, the Biden administration now plans to punish the company for this stunning success. On September 3, the Department of Justice sent a subpoena to Nvidia, deepening the agency\u2019s antitrust-related probe into the firm\u2019s business practices, and the AI market more generally. This comes on the heels of European officials\u2019 raiding Nvidia\u2019s corporate offices overseas in a separate antitrust investigation.\nWhat is astonishing about this response is that these regulators likely weren\u2019t even aware of the company until recently. Before a few years ago, Nvidia was just the maker of advanced 3D graphics processing units (GPUs) for gamers. Though Nvidia\u2019s stock is riding high today, it lingered under $1 per share for many years.\nBut then the firm pivoted as the crypto and AI revolutions took off. It realized that it could provide a new breed of high-powered GPUs desperately needed to meet the world\u2019s ever-expanding data-crunching demands. Over the past decade, Nvidia\u2019s turn has helped fuel a $335 billion private-sector-led explosion of AI investment\u2014more than three times China\u2019s financial stake in the industry.\nAt a time when many are worried about China\u2019s growing algorithmic and computational capabilities, Nvidia\u2019s role in expanding America\u2019s dominance in AI should win it praise and admiration from political leaders. Instead, the Biden White House seems intent on punishing it for getting too big, too quickly.\nThe Biden antitrust crew does not seem to appreciate the wisdom of Joseph Schumpeter, who, 80 years ago, taught us to reject short-term market snapshots and appreciate how the most important competition comes from unexpected places. It is \u201ccompetition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organization,\u201d that really matters, Schumpeter argued, because that sort of innovation \u201cstrikes not at the margins of the profits\u00a0and the outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.\u201d\nSchumpeterian competition is a race for the prize of profitability, which drives entrepreneurs like Nvidia\u2019s founders to take bold risks to unseat market leaders with superior innovations. To deny successful firms that prize\u2014what Schumpeter referred to as \u201cthe most powerful engine of that progress\u201d\u2014would act as a massive disincentive for current or future companies to take those risks at all. That\u2019s a recipe for technological stagnation and lower economic productivity and growth.\nNvidia is the perfect example of how Schumpeter\u2019s \u201cperennial gales of creative destruction\u201d still buffet the tech economy in unrelenting, unpredictable ways. No wonder, then, that Huang regularly expresses how \u201cworried and concerned\u201d he is about the many other competitors looking to eat his lunch. The unofficial Nvidia motto is, \u201cOur company is thirty days from going out of business.\u201d\nHuang is right to be nervous. High-performance computing competition is intense. \u201cThe key is that there are a lot of options there,\u201d says Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, one of Nvidia\u2019s leading rivals. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a situation where there\u2019s not only one solution. There will be multiple solutions,\u201d she told reporters last December. Su noted that chip design is becoming more sophisticated by the day. Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla are also developing their own AI hardware solutions to power the next generation of their computational and robotic technologies.\nWhile antitrust authorities apparently worry about Nvidia\u2019s \u201cfull-stack\u201d computing dominance in AI hardware and software, the reality is that every segment of the AI ecosystem is booming. A recent Forbes survey of the world\u2019s 50 most promising AI innovators included over 1,900 submissions, more than double last year\u2019s count, leading the magazine to conclude, \u201cThe artificial intelligence sector has never been more competitive.\u201d FirstMark\u2019s tenth annual map of the AI and machine learning business landscape featured a record 2,011 corporate logos for 2024, including 578 new entrants and many new business segments. The first version in 2012 had just 139 logos and a few market segments.\nContrast Nvidia\u2019s rise with Intel\u2019s recent stumbles. Intel once played the same disruptive innovator role, driven by former CEO Andy Grove\u2019s famous belief that \u201conly the paranoid survive\u201d in a competitive world. Today, by contrast, Intel\u2019s motto might as well be \u201conly the politically connected thrive.\u201d The firm is practically joined at the hip with the Biden Commerce Department and its industrial-policy spending spree following passage of the massive CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.\nThat bloated law allocated $39 billion in direct grants for semiconductor investments, plus an additional $75 billion in loans and loan guarantees. Intel has been the recipient of much of that largesse and has positioned itself as a sort of semiconductor carrier of last resort for the nation. Yet, Intel currently finds itself \u201cmired in a sales slump worse than anticipated and hemorrhaging cash,\u201d while also apparently considering more drastic moves like cutting back factory expansion plans that government money was supposed to boost.\nSome have even suggested that a \u201cCHIPS 2\u201d bill might be needed. But that would just further politicize AI and computing markets, especially as Washington looks to attach various DEI strings to the grants, including labor and childcare-related mandates, plus the same environmental-permitting baggage that holds back so many other infrastructure projects. High-tech industrial policy is inefficient enough as it is; even its supporters admit that adding \u201cwoke\u201d mandates to the mix will make it even more costly and ineffective.\nIntel and the tech industry should have listened to T. J. Rodgers, former CEO of Cypress Semiconductor. Back in 2000, Rodgers begged his fellow Silicon Valley innovators to avoid \u201cnormalizing relations\u201d with big government. \u201cThe political scene in Washington is antithetical to the core values that drive our success in the international marketplace and risks converting entrepreneurs into statist businessmen,\u201d he argued. Other tech leaders in those heady days took the same approach. Steve Jobs actively shunned Washington, for example, and Apple only bothered setting up a serious Washington, D.C., policy shop years after he died. Today, every major digital technology leader (with the notable exception of Elon Musk) now sends armies of lobbyists to the Beltway.\nCould it be that, by shunning political games, Nvidia has set itself up for a fall? The Chinese Communist Party would love to see that happen, of course, and has invested massively in expanding its own AI capabilities, especially in military applications. China is working to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d to rival Nvidia in pursuit of the CCP\u2019s stated goal of overtaking America and becoming the world\u2019s AI leader by 2030. Beijing might already be leading us in that race, except for the fact that the CCP has tied the hands of domestic AI innovators with a different set of restraints: on free expression. Like the Internet, AI systems depend on the free flow of information to blossom fully. Beijing cannot tolerate such freedom and has moved to enforce its censorship regime at scale, hobbling its own domestic AI capabilities in the process.\nThis gives the U.S. a major strategic edge in both the AI industry and in geopolitics. To capitalize on that advantage, however, America must avoid heavy-handed AI regulations and antitrust threats. As the Lexington Institute has noted in recent reports, U.S. national security requires a robust, innovative technology sector as part of a \u201cnew arsenal of democracy.\u201d When U.S. companies prosper, they not only boost America\u2019s global competitiveness but also help its more pluralistic values, rather than those of the CCP, shape global information platforms and markets.\nUnfortunately, the Biden administration is undercutting those goals when it looks to punish AI market leaders like Nvidia, while also over-regulating AI more generally through executive decrees. In a sprawling, 100-plus-page October 2023 AI executive order, Biden moved to convert the 74-year old Defense Production Act into a regulatory edict to limit algorithmic innovation, even though the law was meant to expand industrial production. This followed the administration\u2019s 2022 AI Bill of Rights, a dour document that insisted algorithmic systems were \u201cdeeply harmful\u201d and would \u201cexacerbate discrimination\u201d without extensive preemptive controls from bureaucrats. The entire effort was overseen by \u201cAI czar\u201d Kamala Harris, who might pursue this \u201calgorithmic fairness\u201d agenda even more vigorously if she wins the presidency in November. If so, it would be the greatest gift China could hope for as it looks to catch up in the global AI race.\n\n\nAdam D.

Shir Tamari, Ronen Shustin, Andres RianchoSeptember 26, 20247 minute readExecutive summary\u00a0Wiz Research has uncovered a critical security vulnerability, CVE-2024-0132, in the widely used NVIDIA Container Toolkit, which provides containerized AI applications with access to GPU resources. This impacts any AI application \u2013 in the cloud or on-premise \u2013 that is running the vulnerable container toolkit to enable GPU support.\u00a0The vulnerability enables attackers who control a container image executed by the vulnerable toolkit to escape from that container and gain full access to the underlying host system, posing a serious risk to sensitive data and infrastructure.\u00a0On September 26, NVIDIA released a security bulletin along with a patched version of the affected product. Thank you to the entire NVIDIA team that worked with us throughout the disclosure process. We greatly appreciate their transparency, responsiveness, and collaboration during this engagement.\u00a0In this post, we will provide a high-level overview of the discovery and its implications. Given the prevalence and sensitivity of this bug, we will save some of the technical details for a future installment, omitting exploit information for now so that impacted organizations have time to address the vulnerability.\u00a0Organizations using the NVIDIA Container Toolkit are strongly encouraged to update the affected package to the latest version 1.16.2, while focusing on container hosts that might run untrusted container images. \u00a0Impact\u00a0Wiz Research discovered a container-escape vulnerability (CVE-2024-0132) affecting the widely used NVIDIA Container Toolkit library, that would allow an attacker who controls the container images run by the Toolkit to perform a container escape and gain full access to the underlying host. \u00a0The urgency with which you should fix the vulnerability depends on the architecture of your environment and the level of trust you place in running images. Any environment that allows the use of third party container images or AI models \u2013 either internally or as-a-service \u2013 is at higher risk given that this vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious image. \u00a0A few illustrative examples:\u00a0Single-tenant compute environments: If a user downloads a malicious container image from an untrusted source (as a result of a social engineering attack, for example), the attacker could then take over the user\u2019s workstation.\u00a0Orchestrated environments: In shared environments like Kubernetes (K8s), an attacker with permission to deploy a container could escape that container and gain access to data and secrets of other applications running on the same node \u2013 or even on the same cluster \u2013 thereby affecting the entire environment.\u00a0While the second scenario is applicable to any organization running a shared compute model, it is especially relevant for AI service providers that allow customers to run their own GPU-enabled container images. In this case, the vulnerability becomes even more dangerous. An attacker could deploy a harmful container, break out of it, and use the host machine\u2019s secrets to target the cloud service\u2019s control systems. This could give the attacker access to sensitive information, like the source code, data, and secrets of other customers using the same service.\u00a0Who and what is affected?\u00a0Background: what is NVIDIA Container Toolkit?\u00a0Running GPUs in a shared compute environment allows sharing a single GPU across different workloads and potentially different users. To enable native GPU access from within the container environment, NVIDIA built a set of drivers and tools that are deployed on the container host and integrate with the container runtime.\u00a0The NVIDIA Container Toolkit is the industry standard of this integration, facilitating seamless GPU utilization within containerized environments. In recent years, the toolkit has become increasingly popular, paralleling the explosive growth in AI and container technologies.\u00a0This library is widely adopted as the go-to NVIDIA-supported solution for GPU access within containers. Moreover, it comes pre-installed in many AI platforms and virtual machine images (AMIs), as it's a common infrastructure requirement for AI applications.\u00a0\u00a0The NVIDIA GPU Operator is a Kubernetes operator that automatically deploys and manages the NVIDIA Container Toolkit in Kubernetes clusters. Its widespread adoption in GPU-enabled Kubernetes environments significantly expands the footprint of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, making it present in more containerized GPU workloads across various organizations.\u00a0Affected Components:\u00a0NVIDIA Container Toolkit: All versions up to and including v1.16.1\u00a0NVIDIA GPU Operator: All versions up to and including 24.6.1\u00a0Note: The vulnerability does not impact use cases where Container Device Interface (CDI) is used.\u00a0MitigationAffected organizations should upgrade to the latest version of Container Toolkit (v1.16.2) and NVIDIA GPU Operator (v24.6.2).Patching is highly recommended for container hosts running Container Toolkit in vulnerable versions, while prioritizing hosts that are likely to run containers, especially those built from images originating in untrusted sources. Further prioritization can be achieved through runtime validation, so as to focus patching efforts on instances where the toolkit is definitely in use.\u00a0Note that Internet exposure is not a relevant factor for triaging this vulnerability, as the affected container host does not need to be publicly exposed in order to load a malicious container image. Instead, initial access vectors may include social engineering attempts against developers; supply chain scenarios such as an attacker with prior access to a container image repository; and containerized environments allowing external users to load arbitrary images (whether by design or due to a misconfiguration).\u00a0Why research the NVIDIA Container Toolkit?\u00a0In the course of our work investigating AI service providers (Hugging Face, Replicate, SAP AI Core, and others), Wiz researchers have identified that these providers tend to run AI models and training procedures as containers in shared compute environments, where multiple applications from different customers share the same GPU device. This insight raised an interesting research question: Could the shared GPU device potentially allow access to the AI models, prompts, or datasets of other customers? This led us to investigate NVIDIA\u2019s Kernel modules, SDK, and runtime tools.\u00a0When we encountered the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, we discovered a wide attack surface for container breakout vulnerabilities, which could potentially allow us to escape our container in the service and access the data of other customers sharing the same GPU resources. This discovery led us to set aside our GPU-focused research and dive deeper into the helper tools NVIDIA provides to its customers.\u00a0The attack flow\u00a0The attack has three main stages:\u00a0Creating a malicious image: The attacker crafts a specially designed image to exploit CVE-2024-0132. (Note: Specific technical details about exploiting this vulnerability are not provided at this stage for the reasons we mentioned earlier.)\u00a0Gaining full access to the file system: The attacker runs the malicious image on the target platform. This can be performed either directly (for example in services allowing shared GPU resources) or indirectly through a supply chain or social engineering attack (e.g., a user running an AI image from an untrusted source). By exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker gains the ability to mount the entire host file system, obtaining full read access to the underlying host. This gives the attacker full visibility to the underlying infrastructure, and potentially allows access to other customers' confidential data.\u00a0Complete host takeover: With this access, the attacker can now reach the Container Runtime Unix sockets (docker.sock/containerd.sock). These sockets can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the host system with root privileges, effectively taking control of the machine (this is a known attack path for containerized systems, see here). Note that while the vulnerability initially grants only READ access to the filesystem, an attacker can exploit a nuance in Unix socket behavior. In Linux, sockets remain writable even when mounted with read-only permissions. \u00a0\u00a0Disclosure timeline\u00a0September 1, 2024 \u2013 Wiz Research reports the vulnerability to the NVIDIA Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT).\u00a0September 3, 2024 \u2013 NVIDIA acknowledges the report.\u00a0September 26, 2024 \u2013 NVIDIA fixes the reported vulnerability and ships a patched version.\u00a0Key Takeaways \u00a0When discussing AI security risks, this vulnerability once more highlights that the real and immediate security risk for AI applications today comes from AI infrastructure and tooling. \u00a0While the hype concerning AI security risks tends to focus on futuristic AI-based attacks, \u201cold-school\u201d infrastructure vulnerabilities in the ever-growing AI tech stack remain the immediate risk that security teams should prioritize and protect against.\u00a0This practical attack surface is the result of the fast-paced introduction of new AI tools and services, and hence it is vital that security teams work closely with their AI engineers, gaining visibility into the architecture, tooling, and AI models used. Specifically, as we see in the case of this vulnerability, it is important to build a mature pipeline for running AI models with full control over the source and integrity of the models themselves.\u00a0Additionally, this research highlights, not for the first time, that containers are not a strong security barrier and should not be relied upon as the sole means of isolation. When we design applications, especially multi-tenant applications, we should always \u201cassume a vulnerability\u201d and design to have at least one strong isolation barrier such as virtualization (as explained in the PEACH framework) . Wiz Research has written about this issue extensively; you can read more about it in our previous research blogs on Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Azure, Hugging Face, Replicate, and SAP.\u00a0Note that this blog post omits some technical details. In short order we will publish a \u201cpart two\u201d that shares more technical information related to this discovery. We are holding off on disclosing those details for the time being in order to give organizations time to evaluate and mitigate this vulnerability in their environments. \u00a0Tags#Research#VulnerabilitiesTable of contentsExecutive summary\u00a0Impact\u00a0Who and what is affected?\u00a0Background: what is NVIDIA Container Toolkit?\u00a0Affected Components:\u00a0MitigationWhy research the NVIDIA Container Toolkit?\u00a0The attack flow\u00a0Disclosure timeline\u00a0Key Takeaways \u00a0Continue readingRCE vulnerability in OpenSSH: everything you need to know Amitai Cohen, Gili Tikochinski, Merav Bar, Danielle AminovJuly 1, 2024Detect and mitigate CVE-2024-6387, a remote code execution vulnerability in OpenSSH.

This time around, NVDA outdid itself, taking the top spot on White's list despite a post-earnings pullback. \nOver the last 10 days, Nvidia stock saw 39,514,631 calls and\u00a023,489,639 puts traded. The weekly 8/23 130-strike call was the most active contract by far over this timeframe, followed by the 130-strike call in the weekly 8/30 series.\u00a0\n\nCall traders are in luck, too, as NVDA is within one standard deviation of a historically bullish trendline. The security lost over10% over the last two sessions, erasing $278.9 billion from its market value -- the largest one-day loss for any U.S. company in history. \nHowever, this most recent pullback placed it near its 126-day moving average. According to separate data from White, Nvidia stock\u00a0saw four similar signals during the past three years. The equity was higher a month later 75% of the time, and averaged a 7.7% gain.\n NVDA was last seen 0.2% higher to trade at $106.37. Despite sitting well below a June 20 record high of $140.75, shares remain more than 115% higher in 2024 and sport a 126.4% year-over-year lead.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @Schaeffers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhich of These SUB-$5 Stocks Could 26x From Here?\u00a0(AD)\nHe called a rare 11x on Tesla\u2026\nThen he called a 26x on Workhorse\u2026\nThen an even rarer 35x on Nio Inc\u2026\nNow Tim Bohen says these 5 tiny \u201cAmerica First\u201d stocks are next up in 2025.\nThey\u2019re trading for less than $5 right now.\nBut thanks to Elon & Trump\u2019s new alliance\u2026\nThey could be off to the races in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.\nAnd right now for a limited time\u2026\nYou can get the names & tickers for just $1 here.\u00a0(AD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFeatured Articles from Trusted Partners:\n\ud83d\ude80 One Stock Pick Could Change Everything in 2025\nWhat if one stock pick could define your success next year?

Justin Pope, The Motley Fool   September 26, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H100 chips became the go-to building block for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers powering models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Technology's most prominent companies have bought hundreds of thousands of H100 chips, giving Nvidia the lion's share of the AI chip market.  The H100's success fueled rampant growth and propelled the stock to a multitrillion-dollar valuation. Now, Nvidia is about to launch its Blackwell platform, its next-generation architecture that it expects will take AI technology to the next level. Should you buy Nvidia stock before Blackwell arrives in the coming weeks? Here is what you need to know. Nvidia could be a bargain if it remains atop the AI mountain AI completely changed Nvidia's trajectory, and it happened seemingly overnight. Revenue and the share price grew so fast that some investors might question whether this is sustainable or just a flash in the pan. Stated plainly, Nvidia must maintain strong chip demand and pricing power. If it does, the stock is arguably a bargain today. Sales momentum still looks healthy. The company's data center segment grew sales 154% year over year in the second quarter of its fiscal 2025, a 16% increase over the first quarter. Management guided for $32.5 billion in third-quarter revenue, representing nearly 80% year-over-year growth and an 8% increase from the second quarter.  Growth is slowing, but it was bound to since the blistering rate last year creates increasingly challenging comparables to beat. But management said in its second-quarter earnings call that H100 demand is still growing. It also maintained that its gross margins will finish the fiscal year in the mid-70% range. Overwhelming AI demand has given Nivida pricing power that has boosted margins well beyond past levels:   NVDA gross profit margin; data by YCharts.  The margin guidance implies that Nvidia still enjoys pricing leverage. Declining margins would be a red flag since that would indicate potential problems like slowing demand or competitive pressure. That would also slow earnings growth, a problem for anyone who buys the stock today with the expectations of strong growth in the future. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 41 times fiscal 2025 earnings and 29 times the following year's estimates, roughly six quarters out. Analysts believe the company will increase earnings by an average of 36% annually for the next three to five years, giving it a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of just over 1.1. It's a solid argument that Nvidia remains a table-pounding buy, assuming growth stays on track.   Story Continues Blackwell's demand seems strongWhether the company can meet these high expectations over the next several years will depend on its upcoming Blackwell chip architecture, the successor to the H100. So far, it seems that the new chip is poised to deliver. Management said during the second-quarter call that Blackwell will enter production in the fourth quarter, soon enough to generate revenue before the fiscal year ends.What's important is that there is more demand than available supply. This, of course, bodes well for continued sales performance and supports the pricing leverage needed to maintain profit margins. The company gets an estimated 40% of its revenue from Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Thus far, these power spenders haven't indicated plans to withdraw from the AI arms race. Nvidia's management expects Blackwell demand to outpace supply into the next fiscal year.The underlying trend supporting all this growth is that more-advanced AI requires more code and data to build and train. As these models grow, they need increasing computing power to run them. Nvidia estimates that next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more computing capacity. If so, old hardware could quickly fall behind.Should you buy the stock?It's fair to question the billions of dollars large tech companies spend on AI, but so much is at stake. For cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft, integrating AI is part of protecting and growing their cloud businesses. Alphabet's CEO has stated that the risk of underinvesting in AI and falling behind competitors outweighs the risk of overspending.Plus, the competition has struggled to break Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI chip market. Intel set out to reestablish itself in the chip industry but has struggled to the point that acquisition rumors are swirling. Right now, the path forward looks clear. Nvidia seems poised to deliver on admittedly high expectations over the next 18 months, which justifies buying the stock as Blackwell is prepared for launch.However, a word of caution: It's unclear whether the company can indefinitely sell this many chips at such high margins. It depends on these power spenders, and big tech companies could eventually tire of shelling out the cash to buy all these chips and instead seek alternatives. You should approach Nvidia as a higher-risk stock even if the fundamentals say it's a strong buy today.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Company wiped out $35B an hour.  Stock is down 20% from record.  Illustration by TradingViewNvidia can make records not only to the upside. No other company in the history of publicly traded stocks has ever lost more value in a single session. Nvidia stock NVDA plunged 9.5% on Tuesday, washing out a mind-boggling $279 billion from its valuation (that\u2019s $35 billion for every painful hour). And it was also a new record \u2014 Nvidia became the first company to lose that much money in a single day. Outperforming even Meta in its worst days when it lost $200 billion after Mark Zuckerberg \u200b\u200bspooked investors with spending guidance in April this year. If we go further back, Meta lost $232 billion on February 3,\u00a02022.  Nvidia has become synonymous with a meme stock for its wild swings, despite being a (former) $3 trillion heavyweight. The chip giant has been struggling to pick itself back up after a disappointing earnings report \u2014 it beat expectations for top-line growth but fell short of Wall Street\u2019s loftiest outlook views. Production delays for the company\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips further weighed on the stock.  Shares of Nvidia are still up a good 124% since the start of the year with yesterday\u2019s close at $108 a share (which ranked it among the worst performers in the S&P 500 for the day). But nowhere near the record $135 a piece hit in mid-June. Based on that high-water mark, the company just entered a bear market, sliding 20% from the most recent peak. And, to wrap it up, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lost $10 billion yesterday (yikes.)

Billy Duberstein, The Motley Fool   September 3, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          TSM            Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) sold off after the company's recent earnings report and are now down about 11% from their all-time high. Nvidia is still posting excellent growth, with revenue up 122% in the quarter, ahead of analyst expectations. But with the stock exceeding a $3 trillion market cap and expectations extremely high, Nvidia sold off anyway following the release. One reasons could be concern over the company's gross margin. Here's what happened with this all-important metric last quarter, and whether investors should be concerned about it. Why gross margin is front and center for Nvidia and AI stocks As the AI revolution took off, cloud computing companies and large enterprises clamored for as many of Nvidia's data center GPUs as they could get. The supply-demand mismatch enabled Nvidia to charge a premium for its chips, even as volumes grew. Hence, its gross margin expanded from a range between 55% and 65% \"pre-AI\" to a whopping 78.4% in the company's Q1 this year ending in April, while operating margin expanded from a range between 20% and 40% all the way up to 64.9% in the first quarter.   NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts  But as you can also see, gross and operating margin took a dip in the recently reported second quarter compared with Q1. Gross margin retreated to 75.1%, a decline of 3.3 percentage points, and operating margin declined to 62.1%. Meanwhile, on the conference call with analysts, CFO Colette Kress forecast gross margin of just 74.4% in the current quarter.  That could suggest a cooling of demand or pushback on price from large customers, who may be getting tired of paying through the nose for Nvidia chips. After all, investor concerns over cloud customers' getting a return on all of their AI spending is what led to the pullback in technology stocks this summer. But Nvidia gave different reasons for the decline In the release, Nvidia noted that the decline in gross margin was due to \"a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\" That explanation should let Nvidia shareholders breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. It has been known that Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip would be pushed back slightly, because of a manufacturing defect discovered late in the manufacturing and sampling process. On the call, Nvidia noted that it made a change to the GPU mask at its foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), in order to improve manufacturing yields. Of note, this appears to be a minor tweak, as CEO Jensen Huang noted no functional changes were necessary to the chip. Still, it appears there were enough defects on the initial sampling ramp-up of Blackwell that Nvidia had to scrap a fair amount of chips from early production at TSMC.   Story Continues It's not clear how much of the decline in gross margin was due to inventory writedowns. But the remaining margin decline was attributed to a \"mix shift to new products.\" This is where things get murky.  Nvidia's gross margin could continue to fall back to earth. Image source: Getty Images.  Can new products garner the same margin?In chip manufacturing, newer products often take time to ramp up their yields, as the manufacturing process is perfected over time. But is the decline in Nvidia's gross margin due to lower initial yields in manufacturing, or is Nvidia increasingly limited in the premium it can charge for new products?Make no mistake: The current workhorse, the H200, is no doubt more expensive than the H100. However, newer products are also more complicated, and therefore expensive, for TSMC to produce.So it's unclear if the remainder of the gross margin decline is due to lower initial yields, which eventually go higher as production ramps up, or if Nvidia, while charging more money for new products, can't maintain the same margin as the sticker price for newer chips go higher and higher.After all, Nvidia noted that 45% of its revenue comes from cloud service providers, all of whom are now pursuing their own in-house designed AI accelerators to lower costs. In addition, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), which isn't a cloud service provider but also probably accounts for a big chunk of Nvidia's revenue in addition to that 45%, has begun designing its own accelerators as well. And rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) forecasts above $4.5 billion in sales for its MI300 line of AI GPUs, which just came out this year and should keep Nvidia on its toes.All of these companies, however, should continue to buy Nvidia chips. Nvidia still makes the most advanced neutral third-party GPU chip, and with developers already very familiar with its CUDA software, Nvidia should still see strong sales over the next few years.But with all of its major customers now pursuing their own lower-cost self-designed alternatives and more competition incoming, Nvidia will have to compete that much harder. That can either come by staying a step ahead on the hardware side, or cutting prices -- or both.Therefore, Nvidia's investors need to keep an eye on gross margin, or perhaps model in some give-back in margin in the years ahead, even as revenue marches higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Tirthankar Chakraborty   September 5, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            NVIDIA Corporation NVDA crushed bubble fears this year and its shares surged more than 100%. However, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price recently faced bouts of volatility after tech behemoths trimmed spending on artificial intelligence (AI) and the company\u2019s latest quarterly results failed to meet high expectations. But it\u2019s also true that NVIDIA\u2019s newest stock buyback plan is expected to please income-oriented investors. So, is this the right time to buy the NVIDIA stock? Let\u2019s have a look \u2013 NVIDIA Stock \u2013 Share Repurchase Plan NVIDIA hasn\u2019t tampered with its quarterly dividends, but it recently authorized a fresh $50 billion share repurchase. However, stock buybacks aren\u2019t new for NVIDIA. The company approved a $25 billion share repurchase in August 2023 and bought back stocks worth around $15.4 billion in the first half of its fiscal 2025.  NVIDIA\u2019s board of directors can afford to repurchase shares as the company has generated significant cash flows. NVIDIA\u2019s new stock buyback plan is currently the third largest on the S&P 500. Apple Inc. AAPL has repurchased shares worth around $91 billion over the past year, while Alphabet Inc. GOOGL has repurchased some $63 billion in shares, per FactSet. Stock Buyback \u2013 A Good Sign for NVIDIA Share repurchases, in general, are an indication of a healthy corporate organization. This is because share repurchases lead to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares and an increase in the value of the remaining shares, which is a blessing for shareholders. NVIDIA\u2019s new $50 billion stock buyback and the remaining $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization may be less than 2% of the company\u2019s market capitalization. However, this shows that management is optimistic about NVIDIA\u2019s future business prospects.  Do share prices go up after a stock buyback? The reduction in the number of outstanding shares often leads to an uptick in share prices. So, it\u2019s expected that NVIDIA\u2019s shares should increase in the long run. It\u2019s prudent for investors to ignore NVIDIA\u2019s $279 billion market capitalization rout on Tuesday since its shares are not down on isolation. The broader tech sector fell due to discouraging economic data. In reality, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) year to date, signifying a long-term uptrend.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Why You Should Stay Bullish on the NVIDIA Stock Being the worldwide leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) bodes well for NVIDIA. The company\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently said that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs.   Story Continues Notably, the global GPU market size is projected to jump from $75.77 billion in 2024 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.GPU Market Size 2023 to 2034 (USD Billion)  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Precedence ResearchNVIDIA\u2019s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares scale upward. MarketsandMarkets stated that the AI industry is estimated to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.Launch of the cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips later this year would eventually squash any skepticism about NVIDIA. This is because Blackwell is more than just a GPU, its infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform.NVIDIA\u2019s initiatives to enter the ever-growing gaming and industrial metaverse space are also a tailwind for the company. Hence, the $2.76 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 73.6% from a year ago (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD, or INTC?).  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFundamentally, NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently. After all, NVIDIA stock\u2019s return on equity (ROE) is nearly 120%, while the Semiconductor-General industry\u2019s is 73.2%. An ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is greater than its equity or that the company\u2019s performance is very strong.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVIDIA Stock is Expensive \u2013 Here\u2019s How to Trade itDespite the positives, buying NVIDIA\u2019s shares may burn a hole in your wallet. The voracious demand for AI models and supremacy in the GPU market has made the NVIDIA stock pricey.This is because, per the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 43.2X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA\u2019s rivals or the peer group\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 18.2X.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThus, investors should wait for the right entry point and buy on the dip. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should hang on to it since the stock is for the future, as AI is the next big thing in the technology space (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Deservedly so. It\u2019s tense. We\u2019re trying to do the best we can,\u201d added Huang, whose comments at a Goldman Sachs tech conference were reported by Bloomberg News.\nAccording to the report, Nvidia is seeing robust demand for its latest generation of chips, called Blackwell, The company outsources the production of its hardware, and Nvidia\u2019s suppliers are progressing in catching up, Huang told his audience.\nNvidia\u2019s chips help develop and run artificial intelligence (AI) models at data centers. The firm\u2019s sales have soared amid intense appetite for these services, with Nvidia becoming \u2014 for a time \u2014 the\u00a0largest company in the world\u00a0earlier this year. (As of Wednesday afternoon, it was in the number three spot, behind\u00a0Apple\u00a0and\u00a0Microsoft).\nHowever, Bloomberg notes, Nvidia relies on a smaller portion of its customers \u2014 data center operators like Meta and Microsoft \u2014 for the bulk of its revenues.\nHuang was asked if the vast amounts of spending on AI is giving customers a return on investment, something that\u2019s been a concern during the tech sector\u2019s AI fever.\nHe said companies have no choice but to embrace \u201caccelerated computing,\u201d adding that his firm\u2019s technology speeds up conventional workloads \u2014 data processing \u2014 while handling AI tasks that older technology can\u2019t.\nPYMNTS examined Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0meteoric rise\u00a0last month, noting that it hasn\u2019t come without turbulence. The company\u2019s stock saw a 20% slump through July and early August, a sign of investor concerns about its ability to meet sky-high expectations. Questions linger about the sustainability of AI-related spending by major tech firms.\n\u201cNvidia faces\u00a0mounting regulatory scrutiny\u00a0as well. U.S. regulators are probing whether the company has pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products or attempted to bundle its networking equipment with AI chips,\u201d that report said.\n\u201cCompetition in the AI chip market is intensifying. Long-time rival AMD is making strides with its own AI processors, while tech giants like Google and Amazon are developing custom silicon for\u00a0their data centers. In China, where U.S. export restrictions limit Nvidia\u2019s reach, domestic champion Huawei is emerging as a formidable competitor.\u201d\n\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily\u00a0AI\u00a0Newsletter.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, AI Chips, AI computing, artificial intelligence, computing, Jensen Huang, News, NVIDIA, Technology, What's Hot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                FlexTecs Updates FlexTrap Tool to Capture Payments Discrepancies            \n\n\n\n\n                FTC: eCommerce Support Platform Click Profit Misled Customers            \n\n\n\n\n                AI Startups: Luminance Launches AI Contract Negotiator; Halliday Aims to End Smart Contracts            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The surging demand for graphics pressing units (GPUs) -- driven largely by AI -- has made Nvidia one of the largest companies on the planet. Can Nvidia grow even bigger? Yep. The chip giant sees a $1 trillion opportunity ahead -- and it's not AI. An unstoppable $1 trillion transition Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in his company's second-quarter earnings call in August, \"[T]he world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing.\" He added later in the call, \"We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.\"  Is further AI demand needed to facilitate this transition to accelerated computing? Huang doesn't think so. He spoke on Sept. 11, 2024, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference. In his remarks, Huang imagined a scenario where AI didn't exist. He said, \"Well, in the world where there's no AI at all, general-purpose computing has run out of steam still.\" Huang argued that \"Moore's Law is over\" -- a reference to the principle espoused by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the speed of computers will double every two years. He maintained that the physical limits of fabricating semiconductors will get in the way. The solution to the problem in Huang's view, is accelerated computing. And no company beats Nvidia at designing the GPUs required to make accelerated computing possible. Don't count AI out, though Of course, we don't live in a hypothetical world where AI doesn't exist. In the real world, AI is accelerating the shift to accelerated computing. Nvidia continues to add fuel to this fire. The company's new Blackwell GPU architecture will enable building and running large language models (LLMs) with 1 trillion parameters at up to 25 times lower cost and energy consumption than the current gold standard Hopper platform. Unsurprisingly, Huang said in Nvidia's Q2 earnings call that \"the demand for Blackwell is incredible.\"  But AI won't just speed up the transition of existing data centers that use general-purpose computing to new ones that use accelerated computing; it will also likely continue to drive the construction of more data centers. These new data centers will be what Nvidia calls \"AI factories\" with data and electricity as raw materials and AI as the product.   Story Continues Look for Nvidia to continue pouring fuel on the fire. The company is now in a \"one-year rhythm\" of introducing new GPU technology. As Huang said earlier this year, [A]fter Blackwell... we have other Blackwells coming.\"A no-brainer buy?Does Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity make the stock a no-brainer buy? Maybe, although it's not a slam dunk.For one thing, it could take much longer than Huang envisions for existing data centers to transition to accelerated computing. The surge in AI-related demand could taper off. Nvidia might not capture as much of the data center market as it hopes.Investors should also recognize that significant growth prospects are already baked into Nvidia's share price. The stock trades at 29.3 times trailing 12-month sales and 40 times forward earnings.But the general premise of Huang's case for Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity seems reasonable. Whether or not you think Nvidia stock is a no-brainer buy, it should still deliver exceptional gains for long-term investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Chip giant lost a whopping $406B last week.  Company draws scrutiny by Department of Justice.  Illustration by TradingViewNo other company in the history of public markets has lost more in a week than the kingpin in AI chips. Nvidia stock NVDA rose 3.5% to kick start trading for the new week after the previous one washed out a huge chunk of its valuation. The AI chipmaker is working hard to recover a 13.9% loss from last week\u2019s four trading days (because of the Labor Day holiday). The decline amounted to a mind-boggling $406 billion drained from the company\u2019s market cap \u2014 a record weekly drop for any public company.  But the reverse records don\u2019t stop there. Nvidia clocked out of Tuesday with a 9.5% dive, zapping a record $279 billion in a single 8-hour trading session (yes, we did the math: roughly $35 billion an hour or $580 million every minute.) Shares of Nvidia are up a solid 120% on the year so far but are down about 16% over the past couple weeks, right after the company posted its quarterly earnings report, which failed to please investors.  Nvidia shares pushed higher Monday despite an ongoing probe by the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division. The unit is asking questions about Nvidia\u2019s partnerships with other tech companies and, more precisely, how these tech giants are teaming up to allegedly corner the market of artificial intelligence by establishing dominance and potentially leaving out smaller rivals.

Consulting firm Bain's annual technology report published on Wednesday projects that companies will need to make \"unprecedented levels of investment\" in technology infrastructure to stay on top of the artificial intelligence boom.  \u201cIf large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,\u201d the report said. The firm's research also states data center operators and hardware suppliers will enjoy a short-term windfall as companies and governments splurge on computing capacity.

Watch Out for These Risks and Oppo\u2026Will Nvidia Stock Bounce Back? Watch Out for These Risks and OpportunitiesNVDAAMZNGOOGMETAWhile Nvidia NVDA has come off its all-time highs, the stock is up over 119% for the year, which makes it the best performer in the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). NVDA stock has largely moved sideways in narrow price bands since peaking in June, even as those moves have been quite volatile, in a typical Nvidia way. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the risks and opportunities that the Jensen Huang-led company faces, and analyze whether the stock can bounce back to its all-time highs.One of the biggest challenges that Nvidia faces \u2013 which was well-illustrated by its recent earnings release \u2013 is carrying extremely high expectations on its shoulders. The semiconductor designer posted better-than-expected earnings for fiscal Q2\u00a02025, and its guidance was ahead of Wall Street's estimates, but the shares plunged after the report as markets were expecting an even bigger beat.Barchart It becomes a challenge to beat such sky-high expectations, especially when a company reaches critical mass, like NVDA has in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Nvidia is expected to report revenues of over $125 billion this year, and for companies of that size, beats of the massive scale that Nvidia delivered last year start to grow few and far between.\u00a0Key Risks That Nvidia Investors Should Watch Out ForHere are some of the risks that Nvidia investors should watch out for:Revenue concentration: In fiscal Q2\u00a02025, the top four customers accounted for nearly half of Nvidia\u2019s revenues. Adding to the concern, many of these so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d are working on their own custom AI chips.A severe slowdown or a recession: While the likelihood looks low, a severe slowdown or recession could put the brakes on the aggressive AI spending by tech majors, which would lead to lower demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips. We saw how aggressively tech giants like Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOG, and Meta Platforms META tightened their belts between 2022 and 2023 as investors pressured them to cut costs. With little fat available to trim elsewhere, the axe might fall on their AI capex next if these giants are pressured to cut cash outflows again.Chip breakthrough: Nvidia has had a joyride in the AI chip space, and controls most of the market. However, a chip breakthrough \u2013 either by a U.S. or a Chinese company \u2013 is a potent risk for Nvidia. Competition in the AI chip space could hurt not only Nvidia\u2019s top line, but also the over 70% gross margins that it is making on the back of strong pricing in the absence of credible competition.Antitrust concerns: While Nvidia denied receiving a subpoena from the Justice Department, the company\u2019s lead in the AI chip space has attracted the attention of U.S. regulators \u2013 who have of late been quite aggressive about antitrust issues, with Google especially feeling the heat.Geopolitical risks: Nvidia faces heightened geopolitical risks, and the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House could be a particularly potent threat, given the former president's tough stance on China, which is a major market for Nvidia.The Demand for NVDA\u2019s AI Chips Is Broadening\u00a0However, it's not all gloom and doom for Nvidia, and the company has several key opportunities ahead.\u00a0During the fiscal Q2 earnings call, Huang was quite upbeat about the data center opportunity, and stressed that\u00a0graphics processing units (GPUs) will replace\u00a0central processing units (CPUs) across data centers. The company has also dispelled fears over its customers not making adequate returns on their investment in Nvidia's AI chips.\u00a0\u201cThe people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d said Huang during the fiscal Q2 earnings call.Also, AI capex is now moving beyond the initial adopters. Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari recently wrote, \u201cYou are seeing a broadening in the demand portfolio into enterprise, even into sovereign states.\u201d\u00a0Finally, along with AI, Nvidia is a play on several other high-growth themes, like gaming, the metaverse, blockchain, and autonomous driving \u2013 though for now, sales of AI chips overshadow all of them.Will Nvidia Stock Rebound?Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia stock to rebound from these levels; its mean target price of $149.22 is 38% higher than yesterday\u2019s closing prices. NVDA's Street-high target price of $200 is an 85% premium, and the stock has been rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d by analysts.Barchart Analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted EPS of almost $4 in the next fiscal year ending in January. Looking at the current stock price, it implies a FY 2026 price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27x, which sounds mouthwatering considering the over 40% earnings growth that the company is expected to report in the next fiscal year \u2013 on the back of 120% growth this year.While a quality tech name like Nvidia trading at a PE-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 is quite tempting, markets are wary about its ability to keep selling loads of AI chips at fat margins beyond 2026, as hyperscalers eventually cut their capex.That said, while I don\u2019t expect Nvidia to roughly double every few months, as it has done since early 2023, the stock should rebound from these levels, even if that recovery might be gradual.While Nvidia\u2019s recent price action has been subdued, I actually see that as a good sign, as the company is now behaving like a \u201cnormal\u201d stock, and is shedding the baggage of carrying the entire AI rally on its shoulders \u2013 no matter how broad those shoulders might be. Investors should also temper their expectations and expect more normalized returns from NVDA stock going forward.

Here's What Investors Need to Know.      Johnny Rice, The Motley Fool   September 14, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock sent investors on a wild ride so far in 2024. It was trading at a stock split-adjusted price of around $48 at the start of the year. The price got as high as $140.76 at one point in mid-June, then plunged to $99 by early August before recovering enough to trade around $130 a share by mid-August. It then fell 21% over a few weeks to trade around $103 in early September before recovering somewhat this past week, and it now trades around $118.  Whew. A wild ride indeed. It's somewhat understandable, of course. As the focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia carries a lot on its shoulders, and expectations are sky-high for this tech stock. Even after beating consensus estimates in its last earnings report, the stock price still slipped. Apparently, Wall Street felt it didn't beat their estimates by enough. While the stock's price trajectory is currently on the upswing, investors are hyper-tuned to its performance and any indication of where it may be headed. It might interest investors, then, that Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has been selling some of his Nvidia holdings. In the last month alone, Huang sold 720,000 shares totaling about $78 million. What does it mean that Nvidia's chief is offloading shares? This latest sale isn't his first cashing in on shares. Since just the start of July, Huang has sold over 4 million shares worth roughly $500 million. At first glance, this might be seen as a sign that the person who knows the business the most intimately thinks the stock price is going to drop (or that there's trouble ahead). But a more thorough analysis shows it's not. Although I can't know Huang's exact thinking, there's no reason to take these sales as a cause for worry.  The simpler explanation comes down to the cost of living. The vast majority of Huang's net worth is tied up in Nvidia stock. Unfortunately, you can't buy a hamburger (or a super yacht) with stock -- at least not easily. Cash is king, as they say. It is far more likely that Huang is simply liquifying a tiny portion of his massive net worth -- valued at around $100 billion today -- to have some cash on hand. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rules around executives buying and selling their own company's stock. To avoid any suspicion of insider trading (as well as tamp down potential transaction-related public panic), SEC rule 10b5-1 allows executives to release public plans that outline predetermined, automated stock transactions handled by a neutral entity. While it may look like Huang just sold this stock, he actually decided to do so months ago and did it in a way that suggests he had very little influence on the price.   Story Continues Tracking insider trading can be interesting, but most of the time it means a lot less than it might first seem to.Nvidia is steaming aheadAs far as Nvidia's future stock performance, the path ahead has gotten far more complicated, but I still think it's in a strong position. The company's latest quarterly earnings report showed continued growth -- it more than doubled its revenue year over year. The thing investors have to remember is that the major inflection point for Nvidia was the second quarter of last year, so it's natural that the year-over-year growth has cooled a bit from the 200%-plus growth we saw in the last three quarters. Just look at the revenue explode in 2023 in this chart below.  NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts. While there was some concern that Nvidia could keep the growth going, many of the fears people had didn't materialize. Concern over a delay in Nvidia shipping its latest generation of superchips was overblown, and demand for its current generation remains extremely strong. Rising concerns around a lack of real-world value for AI potentially hurting Nvidia's clients and reducing their spending has also not yet happened. Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are still locked in an AI arms race, and most are expecting to increase their spending, not reduce it.More customers may be around the corner, too. Though Nvidia's data center revenue is highly concentrated in big tech, we could soon see a broader set of commercial clients and even governments begin to invest in earnest. This would be a boon for Nvidia. Government-related contracts can be an extremely lucrative source of revenue and one that is slow to change once the relationship is formalized, providing an additional level of stability.Finally, the company's push into the automotive industry is only just ramping up. In the short term, AI-powered infotainment and safety features will drive revenue, but further on the horizon lies the real prize: Self-driving cars.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

NVDA surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. The 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.  Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend. NVDA has rallied 11.3% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests NVDA could be on the verge of another move higher. The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 7 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well. Investors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), American Express Co. (AXP) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), as well as two micro-cap stocks Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ELTP) and PrimeEnergy Resources Corp. (PNRG). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>NVIDIA\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+150.6% vs. +106.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+80.9% vs. +21.8%). The company\u2019s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.American Express\u2019 solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.However, with higher utilization of AXP\u2019s cards, costs in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to go up. Rising marketing costs are straining its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. The stock is overvalued at the moment. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)Wells Fargo\u2019s shares have underperformed the Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-1.4% vs. +6.2%). The company\u2019s loan growth is likely to remain limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators\u2019 demands regarding operational risk management.The bank agreed to divest its non-agency third-party servicing segment of the Commercial Mortgage Servicing (CMS) business to Trimont. High mortgage rates and low originations is likely to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term.Nevertheless, its progress on efficiency initiatives, like branch and footprint reduction, will support cost reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to aid its financials, driven by the strength in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment. With a strong capital position and decent liquid profile, the capital distribution seems sustainable.(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)Shares of Elite Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the year-to-date period (+177.9% vs. -0.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $415.56 million has seen first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues surged 109.4%, driven by the success of its Elite label products.The company\u2019s expanding portfolio includes high-value Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for medications like Methotrexate and controlled substances, positioning it for continued growth. Its recent facility expansion enhances manufacturing capacity, supporting future product launches.A robust pipeline and favorable generics market dynamics support long-term prospects. Elite Pharmaceuticals boasts positive cash flows, low debt and a solid cash position.However, risks include customer concentration, pricing pressure from large buyers, intense competition, and regulatory challenges related to controlled substances. Supply chain vulnerabilities and potential overextension in product launches are other concerns.(You can read the full research report on Elite Pharmaceuticals here >>>)PrimeEnergy Resources\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the year-to-date period (+30.3% vs. -4.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $242.79 million has a strong production growth, evidenced by a 134% increase in oil and a 95% rise in natural gas production in the second quarter of 2024, positions it well for continued revenue and earnings expansion.PrimeEnergy Resources\u2019 financial health is supported by nearly doubling revenues and tripling net income in the first half of 2024, along with an expanded $115 million credit facility that enhances liquidity for ongoing drilling. Favorable oil prices and strategic acreage in the Permian Basin offer long-term growth potential.However, risks include exposure to volatile oil and gas prices, rising production costs, heavy capital expenditures and dependency on a limited number of partners. The shift toward renewable energy and potential regulatory changes pose long-term risks to its traditional oil and gas operations.(You can read the full research report on PrimeEnergy Resources here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony Group Corp. (SONY), Becton, Dickinson and Co. (BDX) and Lennar Corp.

That implies another 545% upside for the stock, which traded around $122 a share mid-day Friday.The Jensen Huang-led firm will benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution, as well as migration from Web2 to Web3, Panaro predicted, referring to the idea that the internet's next era will be denominated by blockchain technology.\n\nThose developments could result in big spending from Nvidia's customers, he said, pointing to estimates from Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley that Web3 could fuel trillions of added value in the market.\"Nvidia powers all of the accelerated computing, to make that happen, so they're going to have a major share of that,\" Panaro said in an interview with Schwab Network on Thursday. He later estimated that the firm's revenue could scale by a factor of 10, from $60 billion in the last fiscal year to $600 billion by 2030.Investors may not have to wait long to see some of those gains. Panaro foresees a \"huge explosion\" in the stock after Nvidia releases Blackwell, its next-gen AI chip, though he didn't specify his short-term price target.\n\n\"Not to sound overconfident \u2014 it's actually inevitable provided that they can continue to make these chips,\" he later added of the firm's upside potential. \"The AI penetration in the economy right now is literally less than 1%. So you still have all the corporates, the cities, the municipalities, the governments, the military, that are going to be spending money to make sure they leverage AI effectively. So tons of money still to be spent.\"Some strategists have been skeptical over Nvidia's rally, with the stock up a monster 2,733% over the last five years. Analysts have attributed some of that growth to \"hyperscalers,\" a small group of Big Tech firms buying Nvidia's chips in large quantities.But despite concerns those customers could eventually pull away, the small group of buyers is actually a good sign Nvidia's business will scale, Panaro said.\n\n\"That's actually the best case for why it's actually going to go up. Because if you look at all the other customers they're not getting to, there's 490 other Fortune 500 firms that haven't really adopted AI to the fullest because they don't understand it. You have all these cities and governments that are going to be redoing all their infrastructure from Web2 to Web3, and you then have the AI arms race, with countries and their militaries, which Nvidia hasn't penetrated for the most part,\" Panaro said.He continued: \"The stock can go to the moon, essentially, provided that they deliver.\"Panaro's prediction leans on the extreme end of forecasters, but Wall Street is generally feeling bullish about the chipmaker's stock, which has climbed 152% since the start of the year. Analysts have issued an average price target of $152 a share for the stock, according to Nasdaq data, implying around 25% upside from current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

The much-anticipated Blackwell chip is ramping up production in Q4, and the firm expects it to generate \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d of revenue from it in the quarter; the firm beat on both the top and bottom lines (revenue of $30 billion exceeded expectations of $28.86 billion; EPS of $0.68 beat expectations of $0.64); and management offered solid guidance for the rest of the year, although that fell short of Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations.But one important question came up among the buy-side analysts in the Q&A portion at the end of the call: What\u2019s the AI ROI?In other words, what kind of return on investment are your AI-focused customers generating?It\u2019s a valid and increasingly important question now that artificial intelligence fervor is reaching the two-year mark.That said, asking Nvidia how much money their customers earn from AI initiatives is a bit unfair to the company. It\u2019s like asking Microsoft how much money their customers earn using Microsoft Office.But the reason it\u2019s worth discussing is that the ROI on artificial intelligence is arguably the biggest question on Wall Street.[text_ad]Mega-cap tech companies have been quite vocal about their spending plans on AI data center infrastructure, with Meta (META) indicating it could spend as much as $40 billion this year and Microsoft (MSFT) spending $69 billion on CapEx (capital expenditures) in its latest full fiscal year.At the same time, the ROI question prompted a research note in June from Goldman Sachs called \u201cGen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\u201d in which researchers question whether what could be a trillion dollars of spending in the coming years will pay dividends.On the call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the significant cost savings from \u201caccelerated computing\u201d as providing an immediate return on investment; he also alluded to potential revenue generation from any number of AI-focused start-ups who would presumably rent computing power from the data centers that are built on Nvidia chips.Why Does ROI on AI Matter?Data centers and high-end chips are expensive, and while big tech companies have been shoveling cash towards building them out, at some point their shareholders will need to see a concrete justification for those expenditures.Sixty-nine billion dollars is not an insignificant amount of money, even for a company like Microsoft, and a return on investment that not only recoups those expenses but provides further room for growth is the finish line.As it stands, Microsoft lumps all of its cloud revenues together, so there\u2019s no definitive breakdown that shows revenue growth from AI initiatives versus, say, revenue growth from Azure web services.For the last two years, big tech has been spending money on the promise of what AI can deliver for shareholders, but thus far their spending has really only benefited companies like Nvidia and OpenAI (which is privately held and likely not generating any revenue for itself at this stage; the nature of Microsoft\u2019s investment appears to hinge on cloud computing credit more than actual funds changing hands).If AI does not successfully monetize, there\u2019s little to differentiate it (as far as investors are concerned) from other much-hyped money-burning tech products like VR (virtual reality) or the Metaverse.So, what should we be watching for?Shout-outs in big tech\u2019s earnings calls. If the mega-cap tech companies begin highlighting the additional revenue they\u2019re generating from spending on AI, that\u2019s the ultimate green light. That means they\u2019re now monetizing their initial investment. After that, the pertinent question becomes whether they spent too much rather than should they have been spending at all.Startup funding. If we start seeing headlines about record fundraising for AI companies, that investment is likely to flow through to the big tech companies. It\u2019s not quite the same green light, but it\u2019s significant progress.Earnings further down the food chain. \u201cAI\u201d isn\u2019t the magic word on earnings calls the way it used to be, but if companies further down the food chain are referencing new sales wins, significant cost savings, or new products powered by AI, we can presume that those investments support further spending by big tech.What about red flags?Most companies won\u2019t come out and admit that they overinvested in some new growth arena (see the Metaverse), but what they will do is go quiet.You\u2019ll hear less emphasis on large language models (LLMs), generative AI, and AI agents in calls.Unfortunately, we got a taste of that in Nvidia\u2019s earnings last night when management was quick to highlight their gains in accelerated computing (managing/accessing data faster) but was a little quieter on AI growth prospects.The most important takeaway is that investment banks are already asking about the ROI on AI, and now buy-side analysts have started too. Without meaningful progress in the next quarter or two, the big risk is that shareholders (especially large institutional investors) will begin to doubt the promise of AI and start slowing their investments into even the picks and shovels companies like Nvidia.[author_ad]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n    \n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Print\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Simmerman\n\n\n                    Brad Simmerman is Senior Analyst and Editor of Cabot Wealth Daily, the award-winning free daily advisory.\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet My Free Report\n\n\nAs Seen On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Your Free ReportsYou have access to our expertly curated collection of free investing reports, including 5 Best Stocks to Buy this Month, How to Find Undervalued Stocks, How Options Work, and more.Get My Reports\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Topics\n\n\n\nCannabis Stocks\n\n\nDividend Stocks\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\nInternational Stocks\n\n\nOptions Trading\n\n\nPersonal Finance\n\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nTech Stocks\n\n\nValue Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Videos\n\n\nStill Playing Defense, but Positive Signs Emerging | Cabot Weekly Review\n\nMarch 14, 2025\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Mike Cintolo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Reports\n\n\n\n5 Best Stocks to Buy in March\n\n\nThe 7 Best Places in the World to Retire on a Budget\n\n\nEssential Guide to High-Probability Trading\n\n\nCabot\u2019s Best Dividend Stocks\n\n\nHow Options Work\u2014and How to Hedge Portfolios with Options\n\n\nHow to Find Undervalued Stocks\n\n\nHow to Invest in Stocks\n\n\nTechnical Analysis of Stocks\n\n\nHow to Invest in Cannabis Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabot offers the rare combination of expert insight and confident contrarian/independent thinking to individual investors.

The yo-yo effect of the market has not phased me. Reading your letters are like a prayer to me...they calm me.\n\nA. Khorsandian, Daytona Beach, Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob gives me peace and tranquility. If I have to define him, he is a little more in the conservative side. Patience is his key and that gives me plenty of time to stay relax and trade as he advises. I have an 85% record with him in all the trades. To be honest, I put my threshold for profits lower but as he says that is my technique and I\u2019m quite happy with it. I will recommend Jacob any time.\n\nV.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analystsfor\u00a0Great SpeculationsFollow AuthorSep 01, 2024, 03:20am EDTShareSaveCommentA sign is displayed on a Nvidia office building in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024. (AP ... [+] Photo/Jeff Chiu)Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\nCould Nvidia stock fall to $40 in the next few years from the roughly $120 level it is at currently? Does this sound absolutely ridiculous?\n\n\nConsider this - about a year ago, NVDA stock was trading at around $50, almost 60% below the current value. And less than 18 months ago at the end of March 2023, the stock was at just about $28! At the current market price of $117, Nvidia stock trades at about 70x trailing earnings and 46x projected FY\u201925 earnings. Are these multiples too high? Not if we consider the high growth rates the company has been seeing of late, driven by surging demand for its graphics processing units which have emerged as the de facto silicon for running artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThat being said, stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia\u2019s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We present this as a counter to our analysis of Nvidia\u2019s upside to $300. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock.\n\n\nJust how volatile has Nvidia stock been?\n\nWhile NVDA stock swelled 900% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $117 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA\u2019s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular - as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nNvidia\u2019s Revenue growth could cool off\nNvidia\u2019s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. Nvidia\u2019s revenues were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, growth is slowly cooling off. Nvidia\u2019s sales expanded by about 122% in the most recent quarter and growth rates are expected to fall to around 30% levels by next year, per consensus estimates. There is a possibility that growth could cool further or potentially even flatline.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nWhy?\nThe underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia\u2019s customers remain loss-making. Large language models are very expensive to build and train. VC firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, and the total could exceed $100 billion when including ancillary investments. Despite this, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few AI services besides ChatGPT gaining a large base of paying customers. We could very well be in a phase where companies are seeing so-called FOMO, compelling them to invest in AI just because their rivals are doing so, without a thought about the return on investments. As shareholders seek better returns, we could see capital spending cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia.\n\nSeparately, large AI deployments have two stages:\n\n\nthe compute-intensive training phase, which drives Nvidia\u2019s current demand;\nthe deployment phase, where trained models are used in real-world applications with lower power requirements,\n\n\n\n\nMost companies are going through the compute-intensive training phase at the moment, and there\u2019s a real possibility that demand for GPUs could cool off once these companies move to the deployment phase.\nEven if demand somehow remains strong, Nvidia\u2019s growth rates could be constrained by its supply. Nvidia relies almost entirely on foundry major TSMC to produce its GPUs and there are signs that their product cycles are not exactly in sync. While Nvidia is targeting launching a new AI chip every year, TSMC apparently requires at least 18 months to set up a new factory, per The Economist.\nNow Nvidia\u2019s revenues are on track to roughly double this year to about $109 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 15% over the next two years, due to the aforementioned factors, sales could move from around $61 billion in FY\u201924 to just about $145 billion in FY\u201927.\nNvidia\u2019s margins could be at risk \nNvidia\u2019s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY\u201919 to about 49% in FY\u201924 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for Nvidia\u2019s net income change.\nHowever, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia\u2019s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, big tech players like Google - who are Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers - are doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. Competition will make Nvidia\u2019s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable.\nHow does this impact Nvidia\u2019s valuation? \nIf we combine 1.3x revenue growth (up 30%) between FY\u201925 and FY\u201927, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30%, or 0.7x), this would imply that net income could actually decline by about 10% by 2027. Now if earnings shrink by 10%, the P/E multiple is bound to take a hit as investors re-assess Nvidia\u2019s position as a growth stock. If Nvidia\u2019s P/E gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 46x now to about 20x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock to about $45 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? In practice, it won\u2019t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 5 - if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia\u2019s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a correction. And a big one at that\nAnd it could be a bumpy ride yet again. While there is certainly a case to be made for more long-term gains from NVDA stock, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Trefis\nInvest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\nEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Stanley Druckenmiller\u00a0is one of the few billionaires who have been bullish on the AI megatrends right from the start. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019d buy just anything AI the market is buying. After making huge profits from his bullish bet on Jensen Huang\u2019s AI chips empire, he started cashing out of the company in the first quarter and by the end of the June quarter, his stake in the company was left at just over 200,000 shares.  Back in May, Druckenmiller explained why he\u2019s selling the hottest AI stock, saying he\u2019s had a \u201chell of a run\u201d and he now \u201cjust needs a break.\u201d However, the billionaire said at the time that AI remains underhyped in the long term. Stanley Druckenmiller compared the internet revolution with the current AI boom, saying AI could \u201crhythm\u201d with the internet and the real payoffs will come 4-5 years from now on. The Duquesne Capital founder, who closed his fund for outside investors and turned it into a family officer in 2011, said that the \u201cincremental payoff\u201d of AI investments is coming by the \u201cday.\u201d During the second quarter, Druckenmiller shook up his portfolio to buy and sell several famous as well as under-the-radar AI stocks. In this article, we will take a look at some of those. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   10 Stocks That Have Grabbed Stanley Druckenmiller\u2019s Attention in 2022   Stan Druckenmiller  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\u2019s Stake Value: $26,445,000 (-88% From the First Quarter) Billionaire Druckenmiller cut his stake in NVDA by 88% in the second quarter. Oppenheimer Asset Management recently gave a Buy rating to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). \u201cKey positives for NVDA remain the stock\u2019s bullish trend, high-momentum score, and portfolio tailwinds from a relatively strong Technology sector. In terms of trading, NVDA has inflected positively above the bullish slope of its 200-day average indicating a resumption of the stock\u2019s uptrend, in our view,\u201d the firm said.  However, Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business Professor of Finance, reiterated his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) thesis on a latest program on CNBC, calling the stock overvalued.   Story Continues \u201cNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an amazing company, great growth, amazing cash flow, superb margins, but you are paying a premium price even given all of those pluses,\u201d Damodaran said. Asked what\u2019d be a better buy than NVDA, Damodaran said AMZN is a better stock.\u201cGiven the earnings and their cash flows if I had to buy a stock now and you forced me to a buy a big tech, I\u2019d rather own Amazon I\u2019d buy Amazon than buy Nvidia right now,\u201d Damodaran added. Aoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\u201cIf Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA\u2019s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure. Overall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.Disclosure: None.

Tirthankar Chakraborty   September 27, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          ^GSPC            NVIDIA Corporation NVDA was the top performer on the S&P 500 in 2023 and continued its upward movement this year due to its sheer dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. However, NVIDIA stock breezed past $1,000 in early 2024, making it inaccessible for many investors. So, a stock split was initiated in early June. Let\u2019s examine NVIDIA\u2019s performance following the split to determine its present investment potential. NVIDIA Stock Performance \u2013 Positive After Stock Split In May, NVIDIA declared its intention to split its stock in a 10-for-1 ratio. Immediately after the announcement, the stock climbed from around $900 to more than $1,000. Between the announcement and the split date (Friday, June 7), NVIDIA stock soared about 30%. Post-split, it opened on June 10 at about $120, now trading at around $123, marking a more than 2% increase.  NVIDIA stock, historically, has gained two out of three times in the three months following a stock split. A Statista report using Bank of America Corporation\u2019s BAC data found that companies that split their stocks had an average return of more than 25% in the 12 months post-split, double the S&P 500\u2019s average return in the same period. Fed Rate Cuts Boost NVIDIA Stock After the split, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts. The Fed trimmed interest rates by 50 basis points to support economic growth. The Fed eased its monetary policy for the first time in four years. Lower interest rates are expected to reduce NVIDIA\u2019s borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Lower interest rates also don\u2019t affect NVIDIA\u2019s cash flows necessary for growth initiatives. Going back to the 1990s, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 20.7% in the 12 months following an interest rate cut, while the S&P 500 jumped only 2.9%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Key Tailwinds for NVIDIA Stock Dominance in the graphic processing unit (GPU) market, shipment of the most sought-after Blackwell chips by year-end and significant growth in the AI market also boosted NVIDIA stock. The widespread use of NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software platform over Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD ROCm software platform has given it the bulk share in the GPU market, which is projected to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, according to Precedence Research. CEO Jensen Huang, meanwhile, assured that the high-end Blackwell chips will be available soon to cater to high demand. This is because the Blackwell chips have more AI throughput than the current Hopper chips.   Story Continues A recent report by Bain Technology showed that the AI hardware and software market is estimated to grow to $990 billion by 2027 from around $185 billion in the current year, crushing any concerns that the big cloud companies are contemplating spending big on AI.NVIDIA benefits from the AI boom as a key hardware and technology provider for AI applications. It expects revenues of $10 billion for 2024 from the government\u2019s sovereign AI investments, a significant increase from zero last year, per the Bain Technology report.Strong Fundamentals to Drive NVIDIA StockNVIDIA\u2019s ability to generate profits proficiently and manage costs efficiently is likely to drive up its future share price based on its return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin.NVIDIA\u2019s ROE is 120%, surpassing the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Any reading above 100% indicates the company\u2019s net income is exceeding its equity.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, more than the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any reading above the 20% threshold indicates a high margin (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other S&P 500 Stocks Show Strong Earnings Growth).  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere\u2019s How to Trade NVIDIA StockNVIDIA\u2019s shares rose post-split due to macro trends and continue to be a Wall Street darling based on strong fundamentals.Prominent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 23.7% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $120.87, while the highest price target is $200, a massive upside of 65.5%.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMoreover, the NVIDIA stock is currently trading above the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the 200-DMA, indicating a near-term bullish trend.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVIDIA stakeholders, therefore, should retain their market share due to the strong price upside, making selling unlikely. However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s meteoric rise in the past few years due to the advent of AI has made the stock expensive.New buyers, thus, should wait for an opportune moment to invest in NVIDIA. After all, per the price/earnings, the stock is trading at 43.8X, above the peer group\u2019s 18.2X forward earnings multiple.

[+] September 19, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\nCould Nvidia stock reach $200 in the next two years? We think there is a possibility. How? Consider this, just about nine months ago, at the end of December 2023, Nvidia stock was trading at around $50 levels. This year the stock has grown over 2x since and trades at close to $116 presently. Looking at valuations, Nvidia stock trades at about 95x trailing earnings. Is this pricey? Not really. Especially if you consider the company\u2019s steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia\u2019s formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. The Fed\u2019s recent rate cut could also provide a boost as investors seek growth opportunities in a low-rate environment. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia\u2019s revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $200 stock price.\n\n\nRate Cuts, A Shift Toward Multimodal Models Will Drive Revenue \nNvidia\u2019s revenues grew by close to 3x over the last 12 months, while notching an average annual growth rate of about 55% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years, its revenues could move from around $61 billion in FY\u201924 to around $155 billion by fiscal year 2026 or over 2.5x.\n\nThere are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3-D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Moreover, unlike a decade or so ago when advancements in computing power, particularly with processors, outpaced the development software that could fully utilize these capabilities, in the AI era, the demand for computing power has skyrocketed due to the intense computational requirements of machine learning models. This trend could result in sustained strong demand for Nvidia.\n\n\nMoreover, last week\u2019s monetary easing by the Federal Reserve could provide an additional boost to Nvidia. The Fed\u2019s 0.5% rate cut last Wednesday marked the first interest rate cut in close to four years. Check out our analysis of other ways to profit from the Fed\u2019s next move? With the benchmark federal funds rate standing at 4.75% to 5% post the cut, there remains room for the central bank to lower interest rates further. Lower rates are typically beneficial for growth sectors including technology, which have higher earning potential in outer years, as lower discount rates boost the present value of future earnings. The lower rates are particularly beneficial to Nvidia. Why? Lower interest rates would reduce financing costs for builders of large data centers, potentially driving up capital spending in the space, and helping players like Nvidia which sells GPUs for servers. Moreover, the economics of the AI revolution remain mixed, given the high costs of model training and inferencing. A drop in interest rates could improve the financial feasibility of these investments.\n\nNow the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia\u2019s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia\u2019s downside to $40. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\nNvidia Has Already Done It In The Past\nTo put things in perspective, NVDA stock swelled over 800% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $130 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA\u2019s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular, as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nMargins Should Remain Thick Driven By Higher-End Products\nCombine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia\u2019s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory. They grew from levels of about 25% in FY 2019 to about 49% in FY 2024 as the company sees better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia\u2019s launch of pricier higher-end products such as the Blackwell chips are offset by potential competitive pressures.\n\n\nStrong Results Mean A Smaller Contraction In Earnings Multiples\nNow, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 40x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that\u2019s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won\u2019t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 95x now to about 40x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 65x looks quite likely. This would make the growth of Nvidia\u2019s stock about $200 within the next two years or so a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won\u2019t make much difference whether it takes 2 years or 3, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Trefis\nInvest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\nEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Reputable sources such as Fortune Business Insights and McKinsey report similar bullish projections, highlighting that AI\u2019s applications in healthcare are expanding from diagnostics and imaging to personalized medicine and surgery. The FDA's approval of numerous AI-driven tools in recent years underlines this shift. As AI permeates every level of healthcare, the demand for AI-enhanced devices and platforms continues to surge, resulting in massive investments, partnerships, and growing startup valuations, especially in medical imaging and AI-powered therapeutics.  According to Eric Topol, a renowned cardiologist and AI expert, AI is reshaping healthcare by enhancing precision in diagnostics and treatment. In his book \"Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again,\" Topol argues that AI not only boosts efficiency but also provides better patient outcomes through personalized medicine and improved medical imaging. He states, \"AI has the potential to restore the human connection in medicine by allowing doctors more time to focus on their patients, while AI handles data analysis and routine tasks.\" Topol envisions that AI will reduce physician burnout and transform healthcare delivery globally.

NVIDIA\u2019s Clara platform, an AI-powered suite of tools, supports advanced imaging, genomics, and computational drug discovery, helping healthcare providers and researchers process vast datasets quickly and accurately.NVIDIA\u2019s financials reflect its growing influence in the healthcare space. In fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported $27 billion in revenue, driven by a 41% increase in data center revenue, where AI and cloud computing demands play a significant role. In Q4 alone, NVIDIA saw a 53% increase in revenue year-over-year, reaching $6.05 billion, with healthcare AI applications playing a vital role.

However, analysts keep raising their price targets. This makes shorting out-of-the-money (OTM)put options a superb strategy.The reason is that the market appreciates the powerful free cash flow (FCF) that Nvidia is gushing forth on a massive scale. As a result, price targets for NVDA stock are now over 25% higher than the stock price.NVDA closed at $116.00 on Friday, Sept. 20, which was close to the $117.59 price on Aug. 29 after the results were released. It has been treading water. That makes it ideal for short-put traders, especially since NVDA stock is still undervalued. I discussed this and analysts' price targets and my target value of $184 per share in my last Barchart article. The Aug. 30article, \u201cNvidia's Strong Free Cash Flow Could Push NVDA Stock Higher - Shorting Puts Makes Sense,\u201d also shows an example of how to play this - shorting out-of-the-money puts in nearby expiry periods.How The OTM Short Put Play Worked OutIt now makes sense to redo this short OTM put strategy. For example, in the article I suggested selling short the $113.00 strike price put option expiring on Sept. 20. On Aug. 30, NVDA was at $118.42, so this was over 4.2% lower or out-of-the-money.\u00a0Since NVDA stock closed at $116.00 (higher than the put option strike price) on Sept. 20, the $113.00 short-put contract expired worthless. That is great for the short seller. The short-put play produced a 2.74% yield, given the $3.10 received (i.e., $3.10/$113.00 = 2.74%). In addition, the short seller had no obligation to buy shares at $113.00.Moreover, for existing shareholders, that $3.10 premium received more than offset the $2.42 unrealized capital loss (i.e., $118.42. - $116.00). Also note that even if NVDA fell to $113.00 during the three weeks to Sept. 20, the investor's breakeven price would have been $109.90 (i.e., $113.00-$3.10).So, investors can redeploy their capital to \u201cSell to Open\u201d another short-put contract. More on that below, but, first, let's review why NVDA stock still looks cheap here.Analysts Keep Raising Their Price TargetsSince my last Barchart Aug. 30 article on Nvidia, analysts' revenue forecasts and price targets have risen incrementally. For example, Yahoo! Finance reports that 50 analysts now have an average price target of $145.22. That is slightly higher than 49 analysts' $142.75 average price target three weeks ago.Similarly, Barchart previously reported that the mean target was $142.60 for analysts, and as of Sept. 20, it's at $148.82 per share. In addition, AnaChart.com, a site dedicated to tracking analysts' price targets (to determine how well they perform), now says 39 analysts have written recently on the stock and have an average $145.39 price target. That's up from three weeks ago when the same 39 analysts had an average target of $143.43 per share.Note that this $145.39 price target represents an upside of $29.39 in NVDA stock over the next 12 months or +25.39%. One reason could be Nvidia's strong revenue and FCF outlook.Strong FCF and FCF Margins Lead to Higher Price TargetsFor example, Seeking Alpha reports that next year the average revenue estimate is $175.59 billion, up from $174.34 billion three weeks ago. Note that this is over $50 billion more than the $125.57 billion forecast for the year ending Jan. 2025.As I noted in my last article, Barchart made 45% FCF margins in Q2. That is slightly lower than the FCF margin of 48.58% it made in the last 12 months (LTM) - i.e., $46.786b FCF/$96.3 billion in revenue, based on Seeking Alpha's LTM data.Nevertheless, to be conservative, we can use this 45% FCF margin to estimate 2025 free cash flow. This results in an estimate of $79 billion in FCF next year (i.e., $175.59b x 0.45). That is slightly higher than the $78.45 billion I estimated in my Aug. 30 Barchart article.Moreover, to be conservative, let's use a 2.0% FCF yield metric (I used 1.75% previously). That results in a market cap estimate over the next 12 months (NTM) of $3,950 billion (i.e., $79b/0.02). That is over $1 trillion higher than Nvidia's market cap today of $2.845 trillion (i.e., $3.95 tr/$2.84 tr-1 =+38.84%).That implies that NVDA stock is worth 39% more, or $161 per share (i.e., $116 x 1.3884). This is slightly higher than analysts' price targets, but they are likely to keep raising their targets.New OTM Short Put PlayInvestors may want to short some Oct. 18 expiration out-of-the-money (OTM) puts, 4 weeks away. For example, the $108 strike price put contract has a high bid-side premium of $2.43 per put contract. That strike price is 6.90% below Friday's close but represents a put yield of 2.25% over the next month (i.e., $2.43/$108.00). Moreover, less risk-averse investors may want to short the $110 strike price, over 5% below today's price of $116.00. The $3.00 premium represents a 2.727% yield to the short-put investor (i.e., $3.00/$110.00).The point is that these puts offer the investor both extra income and a lower buy-in point should the stock fall to these strike prices. Keep in mind that the risk is actually much lower than it appears.\u00a0For example, the $108 strike price has a breakeven point of $108-$2.43 from the income received, or $105.57, which is 9% below Friday's $116.00 price. Similarly, the $110.00 short-put play has a breakeven point of $107, or $9 below Friday's close, i.e., -7.76% out-of-the-money.The bottom line here is that NVDA still looks undervalued. Since put option premiums are very high, it makes sense to roll over the previous short-put play and take advantage of these high short-put yields. On the date of publication, Mark R.

In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among Jim Cramer's 10 hot stocks to consider. In a recent episode of\u00a0Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the unexpected strength in the market, pointing out that many companies are doing better than Wall Street realizes. He suggests that investors should stop second-guessing these companies every time negative news surfaces. Cramer praises the excellent management and execution by CEOs, which he feels often goes unappreciated. \u201cSuddenly, all is forgiven, or if not all, then at least most. I\u2019m talking about the incredible resilience in this market, buoyed by a recognition that many companies are simply better than Wall Street gives them credit for. We need to stop turning against them every time there\u2019s a seemingly bad data point. Every day I come to work, I\u2019m dazzled by the resourcefulness of executives who do their best to create value for you, the shareholder. Lots of stocks went up on days like today when the Dow advanced 335 points, the S&P gained 75%, and the NASDAQ jumped 1.0%, all thanks to good management and excellent execution that often goes unnoticed.\u201d  Jim Cramer acknowledges that while some CEOs might warrant skepticism, many are truly exceptional and deserve more recognition for their efforts. He criticizes the overemphasis on short-term economic indicators, arguing that great companies stay focused and aren\u2019t thrown off by minor fluctuations. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not a pushover. I can hit CEOs with tough questions when needed, some of them deserve skepticism and scorn. But there are also plenty of brilliant, hardworking CEOs with incredible teams, and you ignore their hustle at your own peril. This often gets lost in the shuffle when we\u2019re focused on the parlor game of guessing the Fed\u2019s next move, a quarter point, half a point, quarter, half. You know what I say? Let\u2019s get serious. Terrific companies don\u2019t get caught up in that quarter-half shuffle.\u201d  Cramer highlights Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen as an example of strong leadership. Despite facing challenges like opposition to its acquisition of Albertsons and a tough economic climate, McMullen has successfully managed to keep food costs down. Through strategies such as an effective loyalty program and improvements to regional stores, the company has performed well. After a strong earnings report, the stock rose more than 7%, reflecting a successful turnaround. \u201cCEO Rodney McMullen has managed to keep food costs down and deliver fantastic numbers, all while maintaining an expensive, unionized labor force in a very uncertain commodity environment. How? The company confounded critics by developing a superior loyalty program, regionalizing their stores, and creating some of the best private-label products out there, second only to Costco. Food is still expensive, but cooking at home is far cheaper than dining out. McMullen tells us that consumers are no longer flush with cash, especially his most budget-conscious clientele. He notes, \u201cBudget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essentials, and as the month progresses, they become more cautious with their spending.\u201d    Story Continues In contrast, Cramer points out that the tech industry often suffers from misunderstandings due to its complex nature. He believes that Wall Street analysts frequently fail to appreciate the expertise and potential of tech CEOs who have a deep grasp of their businesses.\u201cWe all need to eat, so it\u2019s not hard to understand the grocery business. But it\u2019s quite different when it comes to tech, where analysts constantly doubt the resolve and expertise of CEOs who simply know more about their businesses than the critics. In tech, the complexity often leads Wall Street to conclusions that have little to do with reality.\u201d Our MethodologyThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer\u2019s Morning Thoughts, where he covered different stocks. We have selected and analyzed the ten most notable companies mentioned, ranking them according to how much they are owned by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Huang was there, along with other tech leaders and representatives from power and utility companies, to discuss the future of AI energy infrastructure in the US.\u201cClub holding\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chip platform is starting \u201cfull volume production,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC\u2019s own Megan Cassella on Thursday outside the White House. Jensen, other tech executives, and leaders of power and utility companies were there for a meeting about the future of AI energy infrastructure in the U.S.\u201d NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strong investment outlook is based on its leading position in AI and GPU markets, impressive revenue growth, and advancements in parallel computing. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s latest earnings report predicts a revenue increase of over 107% year-over-year, potentially reaching around $28.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2024. Analysts are optimistic, with firms like Evercore ISI and Wedbush projecting more than 20% upside in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s stock price.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s dominant 70-80% share of the AI chip market, along with its growing presence in cloud gaming and data centers, sets it up for continued success. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to achieve a 38% annual growth rate over the next five years, with revenue possibly reaching $108 billion by 2026. This growth is driven by its leadership in AI hardware, a sector anticipated to reach a $300 billion annual market by 2027.Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's ultimate stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

[+] September 5, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\nGiven its better valuation, we believe Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) is a better pick compared to its AI peer, Nvidia stock for the next three years. NVDA stock trades at 26x revenues, versus about 2x for SMCI. We think this gap in their valuation will narrow in favor of Super Micro Computer, given its more favorable valuation and potential for future revenue growth. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think SMCI will outperform NVDA in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, stock returns, and valuation.\n\n\n1. Returns For SMCI Stock Have Been Better Than For NVDA\n\nNVDA stock has seen strong gains of 710% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $105 now, vs. an increase of about 45% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. In comparison, SMCI stock has fared even better, rising by 1,185% from $30 in early January 2021 to around $385 now.\n\nAdmirably, SMCI is one of the handful of stocks that have outperformed the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023. Looking at NVDA, it saw returns of 126% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. \u2013 indicating that NVDA underperformed the S&P in 2022.\n\n\nWhile SMCI has been an exception, consistently beating the S&P 500 \u2014 in good times and bad \u2014 has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; even for heavyweights in the tech sector, including mega-cap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n2. Super Micro\u2019s Revenue Growth Has Been Better\nNvidia has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 54% from $16.7 billion in FY\u201921 to $61 billion in FY\u201924. In comparison, Super Micro\u2019s sales have grown at an average rate of 61% from $3.56 billion to $14.9 billion over this period. Our Nvidia Revenue Comparison dashboards provide more insight into Nvidia\u2019s sales.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nNvidia has posted surging revenue growth driven by demand for its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) which have emerged as the defacto silicon for running artificial intelligence applications. Nvidia\u2019s chips are seen as the gold standard in the space, and the company has also invested in building a software ecosystem around its products, helping it to potentially better lock in customers. Moreover, AI models are increasingly multimodal, moving from just text processing to working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and consequently higher GPU demand. That being said, competition is mounting, with other players including AMD and Intel doubling down on the space, with big tech giants like Google and Amazon - who happen to be among Nvidia\u2019s largest customers - also designing their own AI silicon. While consensus estimates project that the company will grow revenue by over 120% this year, growth rates could moderate considerably in the coming years. See our analysis of how Nvidia stock could crash to $40. We also present an upside case on how Nvidia stock could rally to $300.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a data center solutions provider, which sells server systems, server boards, storage, networking solutions, management software, and installation and maintenance services. Data center-related spending has surged as tech companies scramble towards boosting their AI and accelerated computing capacity. Super Micro has doubled down on this space by introducing servers optimized for training large language models and AI workloads. Per Susquehanna, capital expenditure spending by the top cloud computing providers is likely to grow by 55% year-over-year in 2024. Super Micro\u2019s customers are also likely to opt for more premium products. For example, the company estimates that the costly liquid-cooling systems for servers, which were relatively rare in the pre-AI era, will be installed in 30% of server racks it ships next year. The company is also steadily boosting its production capacity with a new facility in Malaysia that can produce over 5,000 racks of server kits every month. Consensus estimates project that the company will grow revenue by about 89% in FY25.\n\n\n3. Nvidia Is More Profitable\nNvidia\u2019s operating margin has expanded from 35% in 2020 to 54% in FY\u201924, while Super Micro Computer\u2019s operating margin grew from levels of around 3% to 8.5% over the same period. While Nvidia\u2019s margins have been much better, SMCI has seen strong margin expansion too thanks to its stellar revenue growth rates over the last few years.\n4. Nvidia Fares Better In Terms of Financial Risk\nLooking at financial risk, Nvidia\u2019s 0.4% debt as a percentage of market cap is well below the 10% metric Super Micro Computer, while its 1.5% cash as a percentage of market cap is below 7.5% for the latter. This implies that Nvidia has a better debt position, although Super Micro has a better cash cushion. Overall, it may be fair to assume that Nvidia\u2019s financial risk is a bit lower than Super Micro, although Super Micro is not exactly in a vulnerable position given its healthy cash cushion.\n5. The Net of It All\nWe see that Super Micro has seen better historical revenue growth, better margin expansion, and more cash cushion. On the other hand, Nvidia has a more favorable debt position and its growth is expected to outpace Super Micro this year, per consensus estimates. Now, looking at the prospects and valuation, we believe Super Micro is the better choice of the two. At its current levels, Nvidia stock is trading at 26x revenues, compared to the stock\u2019s last three-year average P/S ratio of 20x. In comparison, Super Micro stock is trading at 2x revenues, versus the stock\u2019s average P/S ratio of 1.4x seen over the last three years. Overall, we think the risk-to-reward ratio appears more favorable for Super Micro, making it the better pick of the two.\nWhile SMCI may outperform NVDA over the coming years, it is helpful to see how Nvidia\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Photograph: Dado Ruvi\u0107/ReutersNvidia This article is more than 6 months oldNvidia shares slump amid reports US is ramping up antitrust investigationThis article is more than 6 months oldFall overnight comes after it shrinks by $279bn on Tuesday in biggest one-day drop in value by US company\n\nBusiness live \u2013 latest news\nKalyeena MakortoffWed 4 Sep 2024 08.46 BSTLast modified on Wed 4 Sep 2024 08.55 BSTShareShares in the AI chip designer Nvidia have continued to slide overnight after a report said US authorities were ramping up an investigation into whether the company had breached competition laws.The company\u2019s shares fell 2.4% in after-hours trading, exacerbating a near-10% drop in the regular trading session that slashed its value by $279bn (\u00a3212bn) to $2.6tn, marking the largest one-day drop in history for a US company.Overnight, the US Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia and other tech companies, in a move that will force recipients to provide information under law, Bloomberg reported.Officials are said to be concerned the company has made it harder for clients to switch to other semiconductor suppliers and is penalising buyers that refuse to exclusively use Nvidia\u2019s AI chips.Such a move would signal an escalation of the US antitrust investigation, and brings the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint against Nvidia.The sell-off on Tuesday came amid a wider sell-off on markets sparked by weak US manufacturing data that raised broader concerns about the outlook for the country\u2019s economy among investors. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s monthly factory survey showed that manufacturing contracted at a moderate pace in August, with new orders, production output and employment levels falling.It sent the S&P 500 index down more than 2%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite shed almost 3.3%. Fears spread to Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index fell by 4.2% on Wednesday and Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 1.9%.It compounded a recent bout of volatile trading in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks, including Google, Apple and Amazon, with investors worried it could take much longer to see the practical impact \u2013 and solid returns \u2013 from the much-hyped AI revolution.Nvidia was founded in 1993, having primarily designed chips for video games, before spotting an opportunity during the cryptocurrency boom where its processing technologies could be used for mining digital coins. It has since shifted its focus to artificial intelligence, riding a fresh wave of excitement over the potential of large language models.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Presumably, they're some of the world's biggest tech giants. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis level of customer concentration could pose a risk to Nvidia's business in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.05%)\u00a0-$2.45\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.08\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:03 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is coming off a blockbuster quarter, but there was a concerning rise in one key number.\n\nNvidia (NVDA -2.05%) is the world's leading supplier of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers -- hardware that provides the computing power necessary for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The chipmaker can't keep up with the enormous demand for its top GPUs, which is driving a growth surge across its business.\nNvidia just reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended July 28), and they topped all expectations with yet another triple-digit percentage increase in revenue led by GPU sales. However, a concerning trend is emerging beneath the surface: Nearly half of the company's Q2 revenue came from just four customers, which appeared to be a big jump from the prior quarter.\nThis indicates that Nvidia is increasingly reliant on a handful of the world's largest technology giants to drive its growth, which makes the company vulnerable if sentiment toward AI starts to shift.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's AI chips are the hottest product in Silicon Valley\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft (MSFT -1.48%), Amazon (AMZN -1.14%), and Alphabet (GOOG -2.30%) (GOOGL -2.19%) operate numerous centralized data centers filled with servers, leasing computing and storage capacity on those machines to millions of businesses that use it to store data, host websites, develop software, and more.\nNow, those data center operators are bolstering their infrastructure with powerful GPUs and renting the computing capacity to AI developers -- a practice Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says can earn cloud providers $5 in instant hosting revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia chips. However, those tech giants are also using their computing capacity to develop their own AI products and services to sell.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech companies that don't offer cloud services are also investing heavily in AI data centers. Tesla (TSLA -4.52%) is using them to develop its autonomous self-driving software, and Nvidia says the automotive industry has been a key driver of GPU sales growth for that reason. Meta Platforms (META -3.27%) is using Nvidia's chips to expand its Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which will power several new AI features for Facebook and Instagram.\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, but during Q2, the company started ramping up shipments of its new H200, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of its predecessor. However, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will offer even greater performance.\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference a whopping 30 times faster than the equivalent H100 system. GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is similar to the original price of the H100, so they will deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency. \nThe GB200 will start shipping in high volumes during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (beginning in November), and Nvidia anticipates it will generate billions of dollars in revenue in the period. \n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer concentration is concerning\nNvidia generated $30 billion in revenue during fiscal Q2, which was a 122% increase from the prior-year period, and comfortably above management's forecast of $28 billion. Data center segment sales, which were up by a whopping 154%, accounted for $26.3 billion of that total. \nHowever, according to the company's 10-Q filing for the second quarter, four customers that it did not name accounted for 46% of its $30 billion in revenue.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\n\n\nProportion Of Nvidia's $30 Billion In Q2 Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer A\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\nCustomer B\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\nCustomer C\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\nCustomer D\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia.\nThe share of concentrated revenue appeared to increase materially from just three months earlier. In its fiscal first quarter, mystery customers A and B together accounted for 24% of total revenue. Nvidia only singles out customers that account for at least 10% of revenue, so it's possible there were other material buyers of its chips in Q1, but they came in shy of the 10% threshold during the period.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to this trend because Customer A, for example, spent $4.2 billion with Nvidia during Q2 alone, and an eye-watering $7.8 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 overall. There are only a small handful of companies in the world that can sustain that kind of spending on chips and infrastructure.\nIn other words, if even two of Nvidia's top customers cut back on their spending, it could lead to a significant drop in its revenue. Nvidia stock has soared by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023, catapulting the company's market capitalization from $360 billion to about $2.6 trillion. Those gains could slowly evaporate if investors become skeptical of Nvidia's ability to generate further sales growth.\n\nWho are Nvidia's mystery customers?\nHere's the good news: Nvidia's top four customers are likely some combination of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, or even ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and each of them has deep pockets. Based on their public filings, we know most of those companies are spending mind-boggling amounts of money on their data centers.\n\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30), most of which went toward data center infrastructure and chips. The company says it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. \nAmazon's capital expenditures during the first half of 2024 alone were $30.5 billion, and it plans to spend even more in the second half to support the growth it's seeing in AI. \nMeta Platforms expects its capital expenditures to come in somewhere between $37 billion and $40 billion for 2024, and it forecasts \"significant growth\" in that number for 2025 to support its AI projects. Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM was trained on 16,000 H100 GPUs, but the company plans to expand its capacity to 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year. \nAlphabet spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of 2024, and it expects to spend roughly the same in the second half. \nTesla expects to spend a total of $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 as it works to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online to advance the development of its self-driving software. \n\nConsidering that those companies intend to maintain the same infrastructure spending -- or, in the case of Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, increase it -- Nvidia's revenue pipeline looks robust for at least the next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is competition coming online. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices forecasts substantial growth in its data center GPU sales this year. Additionally, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are designing their own AI chips right now, and while it could take years for them to achieve the same level of performance, their efforts pose a risk to Nvidia's longer-term outlook.\nInvestors who own Nvidia stock have no cause for immediate panic, but they should keep a close eye on the company's revenue concentration in upcoming quarters. If it continues to rise, the company could be at a higher risk of experiencing a steep drop-off at some point in the future.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The AI arms race\nCurrently there is a race among big technology companies to build data centers designed to handle artificial intelligence (AI). This is a handful of some of the biggest names in tech. While investors might not always be fans of their spending plans, capital expenditure (capex) budgets for these tech leaders are on the rise.\nThe big names that are spending on AI infrastructure include cloud computing stalwarts Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and companies like Meta Platforms, Oracle, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's Tesla and xAI.\nBoth Alphabet and Meta Platforms have come out and said that the biggest risk with their AI infrastructure build-outs is underinvesting, given the huge opportunity AI presents. Musk, meanwhile, built his own data center for xAI because Oracle couldn't produce the AI cluster it needed fast enough. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while these large tech companies duke it out, the one company best positioned to continue to reap the rewards is Nvidia, which through the sale of its graphics processing units (GPUs) is essentially the arms dealer in the battle for AI supremacy.\n2. Exponential computing power will be needed\nAs these companies build their AI infrastructure, there is no sign that this spending will let up. The big reason is that as large language models (LLMs) advance, they need more computing power to be trained on.\nAnd they won't need a few more GPUs for training -- they will need exponentially more. For example, xAI's Grok 2 model used 20,000 GPUs to train, while its Grok 3 model will use 100,000.\nMeta Platforms has said its next-generation Llama 4 model will likely need 10 times the computing power as Llama 3. That would bring the number of GPUs required to train the model up to 160,000. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn its recent earnings call, Oracle said it sees no end in sight, saying investors should have no worries about spending on AI training slowing down over the next five to 10 years. The company predicted there would be no slowdown in the shift toward spending on AI inference, which is less computing-intensive.\nAgainst this backdrop, Nvidia appears to have a long runway of growth.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n3. A software advantage\nNvidia isn't the only maker of GPUs. Advanced Micro Devices is its biggest rival, while Broadcom helps make custom chips for companies like Alphabet and Meta. \nHowever, Nvidia commands a more than 80% market share in the GPU space. In its second-quarter results, data center GPU revenue surged 154% year over year to $26.2 billion. AMD's data center revenue rose 115% to $2.8 billion in the second quarter. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's dominance largely stems from the wide moat the company has created through its CUDA software platform, which is what most GPU programmers have been taught to use. Created in 2006 for developers to be able to directly program its GPUs, the company gave the software away in order to sell more chips. In the years since, Nvidia has built a number of tools and technologies on top of CUDA called CUDA-X to expand its software leadership even further. \nWith Nvidia's software so ingrained in the GPU programming community, it would be difficult to displace the company as the GPU leader at this point, since the time and cost to retrain programmers on other platforms would be too great.\n4. Innovation leader\nIn addition to its wide moat created by its software, Nvidia is also at the forefront of GPU technology. The company recently decided to push up its development cycle in order to introduce new GPU architecture about every year, up from a prior two-year development cycle.\nThe company's current-generation Hopper chips have been met with insatiable demand, but management is already set to begin rolling out new chips based on its Blackwell architecture by year end. Nvidia has already announced plans for its next-generation Rubin architecture in 2026. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis fast pace is meant to keep the company at the forefront of innovation, while also maintaining pricing power. Meanwhile, all of its architecture is backwards compatible and can work with older systems, so customers don't need to worry about large orders quickly becoming obsolete.\nThe company has also started selling complete AI-ready servers, which only adds to its potential growth opportunity. \n5. The stock is cheap\nBesides the company's strong growth prospects and wide moat, Nvidia's stock is cheap as well. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of only about 30 based on next year's analyst estimate, and a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) just above 0.8.\nPEG ratios take into account a company's earnings growth rate, and stocks with PEG ratios under 1 are generally considered undervalued. High growth stocks will often command multiples well above 1. So for a stock with the earnings and revenue growth that Nvidia has been demonstrating, a forward P/E of 30 and a PEG ratio of 0.8 is highly attractive. Also note that this is based on Nvidia's growth for next year, which is lower than its current astronomical earnings growth rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PE ratio (forward one year); data by YCharts.\nThose are very modest valuation multiples for a company that has been growing revenue by triple digits recently and has a continued long runway of growth.\nSo, to answer the question posed at the beginning: Yes, Nvidia is a buy.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via ... [+] Getty Images)CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nNvidia spokesperson John Rizzo told Forbes the company inquired with the Justice Department and has \u201cnot been subpoenaed,\u201d noting Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d\n\n\n\nBloomberg reported Tuesday a subpoena was sent to Nvidia and other unnamed technology companies, citing unnamed people familiar with the investigation and reporting the Justice Department\u2019s San Francisco office was spearheading the probe.\n\n\n\nThe outlet reported Wednesday, citing an unnamed source, that Nvidia received \u201ca civil investigative demand, which is commonly referred to as a subpoena,\u201d requesting details about its business and its RunAI acquisition.\n\n\n\nAntitrust officials believe Nvidia may be making it more difficult for buyers to switch to other chip suppliers while penalizing those that do not exclusively purchase their AI chips, Bloomberg reported\u2014a concern previously shared among those in the chipmaking industry, according to The New York Times.\n\n\nThe investigation into Nvidia has a focus on the company\u2019s $700 million acquisition of AI management firm RunAI as regulators are concerned the deal makes finding alternatives to Nvidia chips difficult, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to Forbes\u2019 request for comment.\n\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

The chip designer has been in a slump since reporting record-setting earnings last week that failed to meet investors\u2019 loftiest expectations. Shares dropped another 1.7% on Wednesday, and are now down more than 15% in the past week. However, the tech company\u2019s stock is still well up on the year after starting January at $48.17 per share.\n\nKey Background\nNvidia is one of multiple tech giants involved in the Justice Department investigation, which is also looking into Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. The Nvidia probe comes as the company is estimated to control between 70% and 95% of the market for AI chips, according to CNBC. The company\u2019s largest and most notable customers include Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet, with Microsoft and Meta allocating 40% of their budgets to Nvidia\u2019s hardware, Bloomberg reported. Regulators have not filed a formal complaint against Nvidia, which also dealt with Justice Department subpoenas in 2006 over an antitrust investigation into its graphics chips.\n\nFurther Reading\nU.S. Regulators Are Looking Into Microsoft, Nvidia And OpenAI (Forbes)\nNvidia\u2019s French Offices Raided Over Antitrust Concerns, Report Says (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Antonio Peque\u00f1o IVFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

[+] product visualizations.nTop\nNVentures, Nvidia\u2019s venture capital arm, is putting several millions of dollars behind a young company called nTop that\u2019s become the leader in computational design software. This type of computer-aided design (CAD) software makes it easier and much faster for engineers and product developers to design very complex parts \u2014 everything from rocket engines to orthopedic implants \u2014 that are most often produced with additive manufacturing (3D printing).\n\n\nCompanies exploring new product design with nTop include Siemens Energy, NASA, Ford, Tesla, Honeywell, Adidas, and the U.S. Department of Energy. Although it is not exclusive to additive manufacturing, nTop software enables the type of complex features and part consolidation that is not manufacturable with traditional processes.\n\nAt its core, computational design uses algorithms and automation to generate solutions to engineering problems while helping engineers optimize part design and function, visualize and interact with designs in realistic virtual environments, and simulate a design\u2019s real world performance, which takes a lot of computing power.\n\nnTop 5 software can simulate the real world functions of mechanical parts. nTop\nNvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the recommended power behind nTop\u2019s software, nTop 5, but now both companies are collaborating deeper to integrate nTop 5 with the Nvidia OptiX rendering framework and Omniverse technologies to help engineers better visualize their designs.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nOmniverse is a platform for developing applications for industrial digitalization and generative physical AI across a wide range of industries for everything from game development to simulating real-world environments for training self-driving cars.\n\nnTop plans to integrate its digital design files into the Omniverse ecosystem to provide users with an immersive 3D collaboration environment to see and interact with live digital twins of their parts and assemblies. As changes are made to designs in nTop of, for example, a new electric motorcycle, they\u2019re reflected on the Omniverse platform in real-time for evaluation and simulations.\n\n nTop's integration with the Nvidia Omniverse enables engineers to see design changes reflected in ...

In comparison, this would take other CAD systems hours, or may not even be possible.\u201d\nNvidia and nTop\u2019s technology teams are collaborating on a variety of new tools and features, Rothenberg says, which will launch later this year.

The pivot has positioned OctoAI as a leader in secure, enterprise-grade AI deployments, attracting a diverse client base from Fortune 500 companies to startups. By offering substantial speedups and cost savings compared to DIY solutions, OctoAI has established itself at the forefront of the AI revolution in business technology.\n\nThe acquisition by Nvidia comes at a crucial time when enterprises are grappling with the complexities of implementing and scaling generative AI solutions. OctoAI's current offerings include a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy and run AI models with high performance and cost efficiency. Their technology supports multiple chip architectures, including those from Nvidia's competitors like AMD and Intel, making it a versatile solution for businesses looking to leverage AI without being tied to a single hardware vendor.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nThis hardware-agnostic approach aligns perfectly with Nvidia's ambition to deliver an end-to-end generative AI stack. By incorporating OctoAI's technology, Nvidia can now offer enterprises a more flexible and scalable solution for AI deployment, regardless of the underlying hardware infrastructure. This move is particularly strategic as it allows Nvidia to expand its reach beyond its own GPU ecosystem and capture a larger share of the enterprise AI market.\n\nThe synergy between OctoAI's offerings and Nvidia's existing AI portfolio is evident. Earlier this year, the two companies announced a partnership to optimize Nvidia's Inference Microservices, NIM, using OctoAI's compiler technology. This collaboration laid the groundwork for the acquisition, demonstrating the potential for integrating OctoAI's innovations into Nvidia's broader AI ecosystem.\n\n ForbesNvidia\u2019s Acquisition Of Run:ai Emphasizes The Importance Of Kubernetes For Generative AIBy Janakiram MSV\nNvidia's acquisition strategy in the AI space has been both aggressive and strategic. In March 2024, the company acquired Run:ai, an Israeli startup specializing in AI infrastructure orchestration. This earlier acquisition complemented Nvidia's hardware offerings by providing sophisticated software tools for managing and optimizing AI workloads in complex enterprise environments.\nThe combination of Run:ai's orchestration capabilities and OctoAI's model optimization technology significantly strengthens Nvidia's position in the enterprise AI market. Together, these acquisitions enable Nvidia to offer a comprehensive solution that addresses the entire AI lifecycle, from model development and optimization to deployment and scaling across diverse hardware environments.\nThe acquisition also brings valuable talent to Nvidia's ranks. OctoAI's team of AI experts, including its founders, who have deep expertise in machine learning compilers and hardware optimization, will bolster Nvidia's research and development capabilities. This infusion of talent is critical as the company continues to push the boundaries of AI technology and maintain its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.\nHowever, the acquisition is not without challenges. OctoAI's existing partnerships with Nvidia's competitors, including AWS, AMD and Qualcomm, could pose integration hurdles. Nvidia will need to carefully navigate these relationships to maintain the hardware-agnostic appeal of OctoAI's technology while integrating it into its own ecosystem.\nMoreover, the acquisition may also face regulatory scrutiny, given Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market. The company's growing influence across the AI stack could raise concerns about market concentration and potential anticompetitive practices. Nvidia will need to demonstrate that its acquisitions and integrations benefit the broader AI ecosystem and do not stifle innovation or competition.\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of the OctoAI acquisition for Nvidia and its enterprise customers are significant. The integration of OctoAI's technology into Nvidia's AI platform will likely result in more efficient and cost-effective AI deployments for businesses across various industries. This could accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprise settings, driving innovation and productivity gains.\nLooking ahead, the OctoAI acquisition positions Nvidia to capitalize on the growing demand for industry-specific AI solutions. OctoAI had plans to introduce more vertical-specific offerings, including in healthcare, which aligns with Nvidia's strategy to penetrate key sectors with tailored AI solutions. This focus on industry-specific applications could open new revenue streams for Nvidia and further entrench its position as the leading provider of enterprise AI infrastructure.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Most Read from Bloomberg The Corner Store Comeback A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities A 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents Roofs of Mexico City\u2019s Massive Food Market Will Power Public Buses   Chinese regulators have been discouraging companies from purchasing Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips, which are used to develop and run AI models, according to people familiar with the matter. The policy has taken the form of guidance rather than an outright ban, as Beijing wants to avoid handicapping its own AI startups and escalating tensions with the US, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The move is designed to help domestic Chinese AI chipmakers gain more market share while preparing local tech companies for any potential additional US restrictions, the people said. The country\u2019s leading makers of AI processors include Cambricon Technologies Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. Earlier this year, Beijing also told local electric-vehicle makers to procure more of their supplies from local chipmakers, part of its campaign to reach self-sufficiency in critical technologies. Nvidia shares fell as much as 3.9% to $119.26 on Friday, extending an earlier decline, after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock has more than doubled this year.  The US government banned Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI processors to Chinese customers in 2022, part of an attempt to limit Beijing\u2019s technological advances. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, modified subsequent versions of the chips so they could be sold under US Commerce Department regulations. The H20 line fits that criteria. In recent months, several Chinese regulators, including the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued so-called window guidance \u2014 instructions without the force of law \u2014 to reduce the use of Nvidia, the people said. The notice was aimed at encouraging companies to rely on domestic vendors like Huawei and Cambricon, they added. Beijing also amplified the message via a local trade group, according to another. At the same time, Chinese officials want local companies to build the best AI systems possible. If that means they need to buy some foreign semiconductors over domestic alternatives, Beijing will still tolerate that, according to people familiar with China\u2019s AI policy.   Story Continues Nvidia declined to comment. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Information and Technology, and Cyberspace Administration didn\u2019t respond to faxed requests for comment.Separately, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said Friday that he\u2019s doing his best to serve customers in China and stay within the requirements of US government restrictions.\u201cThe first thing we have to do is comply with whatever policies and regulations that are being imposed,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cAnd, meanwhile, do the best we can to compete in the markets that we serve. We have a lot of customers there that depend on us, and we\u2019ll do our best to support them.\u201dNvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker, has seen sales soar as data center operators across the globe scramble to buy more of its processors. China continues to be part of that growth, though trade restrictions have taken a toll. In the July quarter, it got 12% of its revenue, or about $3.7 billion, from the country, including Hong Kong. That was up more than 30% from a year earlier.\u201cOur data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during an earnings call in August. \u201cAs a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward.\u201dWhy World Powers Are Sparring Over Computer Chips: QuickTakeNvidia chips are the gold standard for companies looking to develop artificial intelligence services. The likes of Meta Platforms Inc., OpenAI and Alphabet Inc. have been racing to scoop up its most cutting-edge products so they can build leading AI models. Several Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., stockpiled Nvidia\u2019s chips before the export controls took effect.Chinese chip designers and manufacturers, meanwhile, are working to introduce alternatives to Nvidia. Beijing has offered billions in subsidies to the semiconductor sector, but local AI chips remain well behind Nvidia\u2019s fare.China does have a burgeoning AI sector, though, despite the US restrictions. ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have been investing aggressively, while a flock of startups are vying for leadership. There are six so-called tigers in developing large language models, the key technology behind generative AI: 01.AI, Baichuan, Moonshot, MiniMax, Stepfun and Zhipu.Some of the companies are turning a blind eye to the Chinese decree to avoid H20 chips and rushing to buy more of them before an anticipated sanction from the US by the end of this year, one of the people said, though they are also buying homemade Huawei chips to please Beijing.--With assistance from John Liu, Jessica Sui, Zheng Wu, Ian King and Tyler Kendall.(Updates with Nvidia shares in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAdam Neumann\u2019s Latest Project Is a WeWork Competitor How Bogg Bags, the Crocs of Totes, Won Over America\u2019s Moms The Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Elon Musk\u2019s Role in Reanimating the Far-Right Term \u2018Remigration\u2019 How a Short Seller\u2019s Attack Threatens This Spanish Family Company \u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

The vulnerability does not impact use cases where Container Device Interface (CDI) is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis particular library is used across clouds and AI workloads. According to infosec house Wiz, 33 percent of cloud environments have a buggy version of Nvidia Container Toolkit installed, rendering them vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWiz security researchers found and disclosed the bug on September 1, and the GPU giant has confirmed it is as concerning as the cloud security shop makes it out to be.\n\"A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering,\" Nvidia warned in its security advisory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, this is exploitable by someone or something that's been allowed to or managed to run or run within a container on a vulnerable host.\nCVE-2024-0132 is a Time of Check Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability, a type of race condition. This can allow the attacker to gain access to resources that they should not have access to.\nSpecific to Nvidia Container Toolkit: \"Any environment that allows the use of third party container images or AI models \u2013 either internally or as-a-service \u2013 is at higher risk given that this vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious image,\" Wiz kids Shir Tamari, Ronen Shustin, Andres Riancho said in a write-up about the bug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo exploit CVE-2024-0132, an attacker would need to craft a specially designed image and then get the image to run on the target platform, either indirectly, by convincing/tricking the user into running the malicious image, or directly, if the attacker has access to shared GPU resources.\n\nHPE patches three critical flaws in Aruba proprietary access protocol Interface\nIvanti patches exploited admin command execution flaw\nVMware patches remote make-me-root holes in vCenter Server, Cloud Foundation\nDoomsday '9.9 RCE bug' might hit every Linux system\n\nIn a single-tenant compute environment, this could happen if a user downloads a malicious container image \u2014\u00a0say, via a social engineering attack where the user believes the container image is coming from a trusted source. In this scenario, the attacker could then take over the user's workstation.\nIn a shared environment, such as Kubernetes-powered one, however, a miscreant with permission to deploy a container could escape it and then access data or secrets of other applications on the same node or cluster, the researchers noted.\u00a0\nThis second scenario \"is especially relevant for AI service providers that allow customers to run their own GPU-enabled container images,\" they warned.\n\"An attacker could deploy a harmful container, break out of it, and use the host machine's secrets to target the cloud service's control systems,\" the researchers continued. \"This could give the attacker access to sensitive information, like the source code, data, and secrets of other customers using the same service.\"\u00a0\nWiz isn't providing too many technical details about how to exploit the vuln because the security shop wants to ensure that vulnerable organizations have time to deploy the fix \u2014 and not have their host system taken over with root privileges.\nBut the researchers promised more to come soon, including exploit details, so it's a good idea to get ahead of the would-be attackers on this one. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about\n\n\n\n\n                Nvidia\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n

Here's What Investors Need to Know.\n\n\n  \n      By Johnny Rice\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Sep 14, 2024 at 7:10AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, is selling millions of dollars in Nvidia stock he owns. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsiders like Huang follow special SEC rules like 10b5-1 to manage their stock transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the selling, Nvidia is in a strong position and poised for continued growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.05%)\u00a0-$2.45\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.08\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 3:03 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is Jensen Huang selling Nvidia stock?\n\nNvidia (NVDA -2.05%) stock sent investors on a wild ride so far in 2024. It was trading at a stock split-adjusted price of around $48 at the start of the year. The price got as high as $140.76 at one point in mid-June, then plunged to $99 by early August before recovering enough to trade around $130 a share by mid-August. It then fell 21% over a few weeks to trade around $103 in early September before recovering somewhat this past week, and it now trades around $118.\nWhew. A wild ride indeed. \n\nIt's somewhat understandable, of course. As the focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia carries a lot on its shoulders, and expectations are sky-high for this tech stock. Even after beating consensus estimates in its last earnings report, the stock price still slipped. Apparently, Wall Street felt it didn't beat their estimates by enough. While the stock's price trajectory is currently on the upswing, investors are hyper-tuned to its performance and any indication of where it may be headed.\nIt might interest investors, then, that Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has been selling some of his Nvidia holdings. In the last month alone, Huang sold 720,000 shares totaling about $78 million.\nWhat does it mean that Nvidia's chief is offloading shares?\nThis latest sale isn't his first cashing in on shares. Since just the start of July, Huang has sold over 4 million shares worth roughly $500 million. At first glance, this might be seen as a sign that the person who knows the business the most intimately thinks the stock price is going to drop (or that there's trouble ahead). But a more thorough analysis shows it's not. Although I can't know Huang's exact thinking, there's no reason to take these sales as a cause for worry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simpler explanation comes down to the cost of living. The vast majority of Huang's net worth is tied up in Nvidia stock. Unfortunately, you can't buy a hamburger (or a super yacht) with stock -- at least not easily. Cash is king, as they say. It is far more likely that Huang is simply liquifying a tiny portion of his massive net worth -- valued at around $100 billion today -- to have some cash on hand.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rules around executives buying and selling their own company's stock. To avoid any suspicion of insider trading (as well as tamp down potential transaction-related public panic), SEC rule 10b5-1 allows executives to release public plans that outline predetermined, automated stock transactions handled by a neutral entity. While it may look like Huang just sold this stock, he actually decided to do so months ago and did it in a way that suggests he had very little influence on the price.\nTracking insider trading can be interesting, but most of the time it means a lot less than it might first seem to.\nNvidia is steaming ahead\nAs far as Nvidia's future stock performance, the path ahead has gotten far more complicated, but I still think it's in a strong position. The company's latest quarterly earnings report showed continued growth -- it more than doubled its revenue year over year. The thing investors have to remember is that the major inflection point for Nvidia was the second quarter of last year, so it's natural that the year-over-year growth has cooled a bit from the 200%-plus growth we saw in the last three quarters. Just look at the revenue explode in 2023 in this chart below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\nWhile there was some concern that Nvidia could keep the growth going, many of the fears people had didn't materialize. Concern over a delay in Nvidia shipping its latest generation of superchips was overblown, and demand for its current generation remains extremely strong. Rising concerns around a lack of real-world value for AI potentially hurting Nvidia's clients and reducing their spending has also not yet happened. Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are still locked in an AI arms race, and most are expecting to increase their spending, not reduce it.\nMore customers may be around the corner, too. Though Nvidia's data center revenue is highly concentrated in big tech, we could soon see a broader set of commercial clients and even governments begin to invest in earnest. This would be a boon for Nvidia. Government-related contracts can be an extremely lucrative source of revenue and one that is slow to change once the relationship is formalized, providing an additional level of stability.\nFinally, the company's push into the automotive industry is only just ramping up. In the short term, AI-powered infotainment and safety features will drive revenue, but further on the horizon lies the real prize: Self-driving cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Most Read from Bloomberg World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World\u2019s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office   The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint. Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don\u2019t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Nvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting $279 billion rout on Tuesday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year \u2014 fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker. As part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ\u2019s San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said. A representative for the DOJ declined to comment.  In response to questions about the probe, Nvidia said that its market dominance stems from the quality of its products, which deliver faster performance. \u201cNvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, who can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. Nvidia has drawn regulatory scrutiny since becoming the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker and a key beneficiary of the AI spending boom. Sales have been more than doubling each quarter, and it\u2019s eclipsed onetime chip leaders such as Intel Corp. In the DOJ probe, regulators have been investigating Nvidia\u2019s acquisition of RunAI, a deal announced in April. That company makes software for managing AI computing, and there are concerns that the tie-up will make it more difficult for customers to switch away from Nvidia chips. Regulators also are inquiring whether Nvidia gives preferential supply and pricing to customers who use its technology exclusively or buy its complete systems, according to the people.   Story Continues Nvidia, founded in 1993, made its name by selling graphics cards to computer gamers. But its approach to chipmaking ultimately proved useful for building AI models, a process that involves bombarding the software with data. The company also has rapidly expanded its lineup with a range of software, servers, networking and services \u2014 all aimed, Nvidia argues, at speeding up the deployment of AI.Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he prioritizes customers who can make use of his products in ready-to-go data centers as soon as he provides them, a policy designed to prevent stockpiling and speed up the broader adoption of AI.The success of its products \u2014 along with struggles by rivals to field alternative chips \u2014 has made Nvidia a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the biggest companies in the world. Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., for example, spend more than 40% of their budget for hardware on the chipmaker\u2019s gear. During the peak of shortages of Nvidia\u2019s H100 accelerator, individual components were retailing for as much as $90,000 each.WATCH: How Nvidia Changed the GameAnalysts project that Nvidia will chalk up $120.8 billion of revenue in calendar 2024, up from $16 billion in 2020, with most of that money coming from its data center unit. In fact, Nvidia is set to bring in more profit this year than the total sales of its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.There also are broader regulatory questions about Nvidia\u2019s practices. Access to AI capabilities has become a key focus for governments around the world, with the technology becoming increasingly vital to economic strength and national security.(Updates with Nvidia response starting in sixth paragraph.

Nvidia stock jumped more than 5%, while its rival Advanced Micro Devices saw shares rise as much as 7% in afternoon trading, before edging down slightly to close the day.  The rising stock prices illustrate that investors are absorbing \u2014 and believing \u2014 Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s message that the US economy is \u201cin good shape.\u201d The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the stock market\u2019s upward trajectory. The index rose 2.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.7% and the Dow (^DJI) climbed 1.3%. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.66 -2.87 (-2.40%)  As of 3:07:32 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA AMD   Advanced Chart    The so-called Magnificent Seven Big Tech stocks all posted gains. Meta (META) stock rose 4%; Apple (AAPL) jumped 3.7%. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) all bumped up nearly 2%. But the semiconductor subsector of the tech industry was a top gainer. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) climbed nearly 5%. Nvidia\u2019s climb is welcome news to investors who watched the stock\u2019s roller-coaster ride in recent weeks. The chipmaker's shares fell after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings at the end of August, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectations but lowering its projected gross margin for the full year.  The stock tumbled further upon news that the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia as the agency ramped up its antitrust investigation of the company. But it jumped again after CEO Jensen Huang successfully pitched investors on AI\u2019s return on investment during a Goldman Sachs conference last week, and big names like Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have reportedly \u201cbegged\u201d for more Nvidia AI chips. And while Nvidia\u2019s stock price may be down about 12% from three months ago, it\u2019s up a staggering 172% from this time last year. The semiconductor superpower has continued to benefit from the AI boom, which is proving to be more than just hype. Although Nvidia dominates the market for AI hardware, AMD is also a major beneficiary of the AI innovation wave. While the stock has faced ups and downs throughout the last year and has come down from record highs in March, shares are up nearly 55% from last year. AMD in late June posted second quarter profits up nearly 20% from the prior year. The company will report third quarter results in late October.  The semiconductor sector\u2019s good day is a bright spot as it faces uncertainty with the US presidential election inching closer. Both presidential candidates\u2019 tough-on-China stances would be bad news for American chip companies like Nvidia. The Biden administration implemented tough export controls banning Chinese companies from directly buying chips from Nvidia and AMD in 2022.   Story Continues The US introduced further restrictions regarding semiconductor and quantum computing exports earlier this month. In the meantime, Nvidia is working on a custom chip for Chinese customers that complies with current trade restrictions.  Nvidia corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif..

The stock has skyrocketed more than 700% since January 2023 amid excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). But excitement is a double-edged sword. Numerous companies are now designing custom AI chips, and some investors are concerned Nvidia will lose market share.  The following hedge fund billionaires have navigated the situation by selling shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, and redeploying capital into the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), a growth-focused index fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 index. Cliff Asness at AQR Capital sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia, shrinking his stake by 8%. He also bought 9,254 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position 332%. Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 409,042 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 16%. He also bought 1,500 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position 150%. Israel Englander at Millennium Management sold 676,242 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake 5%. He also bought 81,616 shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position by 557%. Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake 79%. He also purchased 2.8 million shares of the Invesco QQQ Trust, increasing his position by 585%. David Shaw at D.E. Shaw sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, cutting his stake 52%. He also started a small position in the Invesco QQQ Trust.   Importantly, these trades do not signal a complete lack of confidence in Nvidia. Not only do all five fund managers still have positions in the chipmaker, but also Nvidia is the third largest position in the Invesco QQQ Trust. Having said that, their decision to buy the index fund is sensible because it diversifies their portfolios across more technology stocks likely to benefit from the AI boom. Here's what investors should know about the Invesco QQQ Trust. The Invesco QQQ Trust provides heavy exposure to technology stocks The Invesco QQQ Trust measures the performance of the Nasdaq-100, an index that tracks the 100 largest non-financial companies on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The index fund is heavily weighted toward the information technology sector. The 10 largest holdings are listed by weight: Apple: 8.9% Microsoft: 8.3% Nvidia: 7.7% Broadcom: 5.1% Amazon: 5.1% Meta Platforms: 4.8% Alphabet: 4.6% Tesla: 2.9% Costco Wholesale: 2.7% Netflix: 2%  Many investors see Nvidia as a paragon of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks because the company dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that are the gold standard in speeding up complex workloads such as training machine learning models. But several other companies in that list are well positioned to monetize AI.   Story Continues For instance, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have the three largest public clouds in the world. That means they should be major beneficiaries as businesses invest in the cloud infrastructure and platform services required to train AI models and develop AI applications.Similarly, Broadcom helps customers like Alphabet and Meta Platforms design custom AI chips, and it recently won a major deal with OpenAI. That bodes well for the company because Morgan Stanley analysts expect the custom AI chip market to grow more quickly than the GPU market through the end of the decade.Finally, Tesla is dedicated to developing full self-driving (FSD) software, and the company plans to monetize its FSD platform through subscription sales and robotaxi services.The Invesco QQQ Trust produced supercharged returns over the past 20 yearsThe Invesco QQQ Trust has been an excellent long-term investment. The index fund returned 1,490% over the past 20 years, compounding at 14.8% annually. By comparison, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned 641% during the same period, compounding at 10.5% annually.The downside of the Invesco QQQ Trust is volatility. The fund is highly concentrated in technology stocks, such that weakness in that market sector can cause it to nosedive. The Invesco QQQ Trust has a 10-year beta of 1.12, meaning it moved 1.12 percentage points for every 1-percentage-point movement in the S&P 500.Volatility cuts both ways. On one hand, the Invesco QQQ Trust more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 during the past two decades. On the other hand, the Invesco QQQ Trust declined much more sharply than the S&P 500 during the most recent bear market. Specifically, the index fund suffered a maximum drawdown of 35%, while the S&P 500 never fell more than 24%.The last item of note is the expense ratio. The Invesco QQQ Trust has an expense ratio of 0.2%, meaning investors will pay $2 per year on every $1,000 invested in the index fund. That's below the industry average of 0.36%, according to Morningstar.Here is the bottom line: The Invesco QQQ Trust is a growth-focused index fund that tracks several companies well positioned to benefit from the artificial intelligence boom, including Nvidia. The index fund's concentration in technology stocks makes it volatile, but that volatility has been an asset over the past two decades, given its outperformance compared to the S&P 500.I think the Invesco QQQ Trust will continue to outperform over the next decade as the AI boom unfolds. Patient investors comfortable with risk and volatility should consider buying a small position today. And shareholders should lean into market weakness by adding to their position during significant pullbacks.Should you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?Before you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

That\u2019s an increasing problem as the world\u2019s largest companies pour hundreds of billions of dollars into new infrastructure that they believe is the future of computing. It\u2019s a squeeze that\u2019s leading to trade-offs being made on the location of the new \u201cAI factories,\u201d as Huang refers to them. Some data centers can\u2019t be filled to full capacity, and others are being built well away from population centers. Nvidia\u2019s leader has argued that his company\u2019s products, while more power hungry than their predecessors \u2014 the latest generation chip requires over a kilowatt \u2014 are more efficient because they can do the work of training and running AI software more quickly and replace multiple older components.  Separately, Huang said he\u2019s doing his best to serve customers in China and stay within the requirements of US government restrictions on Nvidia\u2019s exports to that country. \u201cThe first thing we have to do is comply with whatever policies and regulations that are being imposed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, meanwhile, do the best we can to compete in the markets that we serve. We have a lot of customers there that depend on us and we\u2019ll do our best to support them.\u201d --With assistance from Ed Ludlow and Ian King.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I am the Kester and Brynes Professor at Columbia Business School and a Chazen Senior Scholar at the Jerome A. Chazen Institute for Global Business.Follow AuthorSep 17, 2024, 08:27pm EDTShareSaveCommentWithout data about number of units of products sold and average price at which such products are sold, it is hard to have intelligent conversations about whether NVIDIA\u2019s $2.9 trillion valuation is justified or not.\nTAIPEI, TAIWAN - 2023/06/01: Jensen Huang, President of NVIDIA holding the Grace hopper superchip ... [+] CPU used for generative AI at supermicro keynote presentation during the COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThis semester, we discuss NVIDIA as our live case in my class. An important analytical tool that we usually ask students to think about is to decompose a firm\u2019s revenue into quantity of product sold (Q), the product mix sold (M), the selling price per unit of the product (P) and any foreign currency impact (FX). The roots of this thinking go back to some of the Apples-to-Apples work conducted by Trevor Harris at Morgan Stanley in the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nWhy decompose revenue this way? I often tell students that Q is among the best ways to ground the company\u2019s valuation into a strategic plan for management.\n\nNetflix Q\n\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider a simple example. Ignore M and FX for now. As of 9/16/2024, Netflix trades at $702 a share. In the year just ended, Netflix reported an annual EPS (earnings per share) of $12.03. Assuming a cost of equity capital of roughly 9% (treasury bill yield of 3.65%, beta of 1.1, assuming a risk premium of 5%), Netflix\u2019s earnings per share earned till perpetuity would amount to $133 ($12.03/0.09). This simple calculation suggests that Netflix needs to earn $58.2 more in earnings per share in the future [($702-133) = $569*.09]. This translates approximately to $23 billion more in annual income every year (450 million shares*$51). Now, bring this back to Q. Netflix reported 278 million paying subscribers as of July 2024. This suggests that the company will have to generate $83 in additional profit every year from every subscriber ($23 billion/278 million subscribers). That\u2019s $83 in income not revenue or roughly $7 per month in profit. Is that feasible, given that the US and Canadian market (roughly 76 million subscribers) is likely saturated and likely the only ones most insensitive to price increases?\nThe bigger point is that one can at least have strategic conversations, grounded in data, regarding Netflix\u2019s valuation. Most analyst and board room conversations tend to center around growth rate in earnings (g). I find abstract comments about growth rate (g) embedded in valuation somewhat useless. How do I calibrate g? What does that mean for Netflix\u2019s strategy or the possibility that they will hit that growth rate? Conversations about Q are far more insightful to me.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nSo, what does this have to do with NVIDIA?\nNVIDIA\n\nWell, NVIDIA does not disclose Q and P. Consider the data. As of 9/16/2024, NVIDIA trades at $118 per share. I usually benchmark this to EPS from last year, but NVIDIA is a special case because their revenue in the first two quarters this year is as high as the revenue for all of last year. The cumulative EPS for the first half of this year is $1.29. Let\u2019s simply extrapolate this to the year ($2.60). Assuming a cost of equity capital around 13% (treasury bill yield of 3.65%, beta of 1.8, assuming a risk premium of 5%), we are looking at $20 per share as the value of repeating this year\u2019s forecasted EPS forever ($2.6/0.13). This suggests that NVIDIA will need to earn an additional $12.74 ($118-$20 = $98*.13) or essentially increase EPS by six times of this year\u2019s income. Is that feasible?\n\n\nI then look for Q and P and come back emptyhanded. NVIDIA has three fast growing segments (Data Center segment, Networking segment and the Automotive segment) and two steady segments (Gaming and Visualization). Here is NVIDIA\u2019s disclosure in its latest 10-K that comes the closest to being useful.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago. Data Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 217%. Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer internet applications, and multiple industry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare. Customers across industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. Data Center compute revenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year. Gaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels and growing demand. Professional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%. Automotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving platforms.\nUnfortunately, there is no conversation about how much Q and P does NVIDIA sell in even one major segment (data center). How many GPUs (graphical processing units) does NVIDIA sell? How many more does it need to sell to grow into its valuation? If your comeback is that it will do something else, please articulate what that something is and how much of P and Q of that something the company must sell? Without such data, it is hard to have intelligent conversations about whether NVIDIA\u2019s $2.9 trillion valuation is justified or not.\nLarge sample evidence \nIn a recently completed paper, my co-authors (Sriniwas Mahapatro of the Rochester Institute of Technology, Prateek Manikpuri and Prasanna Tantri of the Indian School of Business) and I look at a natural experiment in India where manufacturing firms were required to disclose product-level revenues and quantities sold in audited financial statements from 1997-2011. We document that such mandated disclosure of quantities and product prices (i) reveal the persistence of sales growth of firms; (ii) reduce information asymmetry between the manager and the market; (iii) reduce analysts\u2019 revenue forecast errors; and (iv) reduce the stock market reaction to earnings announcements.\nThe large sample evidence simply confirms the intuition that it is very difficult to bring back valuations to strategic conversations unless we know something about the firms\u2019 P and Q. In particular, is the stock market\u2019s assessment of NVIDIA\u2019s future consistent with their plans on how much product and services to sell, how much to price the product and services, and what we might be assuming about competition or lack thereof or about the firm\u2019s cost structure (e.g., fixed costs don\u2019t change much as Q changes within a range). Concrete data on P and Q can move us from hypothetical guesswork to an evidence-based dialogue on the feasibility of NVIDIA growing into their valuation.\nComments welcome, as always.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Log in.\n\n\n\nAlmost half of Nvidia's $30 billion revenue in the second quarter came from four customers.A tech analyst said this concentration of revenue was \"highly unusual\" for a mega-cap company.The analyst gave three reasons Nvidia investors should be concerned about it.Nvidia notched $30 billion in revenue for the second quarter, beating many analysts' estimates for the period. Nearly half of that came from four customers, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from the company.\n\nThat should keep investors on alert for the next year or two, Gil Luria, a tech analyst who covers Nvidia for the investment firm D.A. Davidson, told Business Insider.According to the company filing, just four customers brought in 46% of Nvidia's total Q2 revenue \u2014 about $13.8 billion.\n\nThe companies are kept anonymous in the filing. There's no disclosure law that requires Nvidia to reveal its clients' names, Luria said.But Luria added that the customers were likely to be Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google. All four companies are known to be ramping up their GPU stockpiles as they aggressively pursue AI initiatives.\"The only way that they're not the four is if one of their customers is a reseller,\" Luria said, naming Dell and Supermicro as examples.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment, and none of the four purported customers responded to requests for comment.Luria said it was \"highly unusual for a company\" at Nvidia's scale to lean on a handful of clients for a large chunk of its revenue.\"None of the other mega caps even have one 10% customer,\" the tech analyst said, referring to large companies with a market capitalization of more than $200 billion. As of Wednesday, Nvidia's market cap was $2.61 trillion.\n\nLuria maintained a hold rating for Nvidia stock, citing concerns about the sustainability of demand.Jacob Bourne, a tech analyst for Emarketer, told BI the high concentration of revenue might be unusual within the context of the broader marketplace. But he said it was normal for tech companies that provide a specialized product, such as graphics processing units.Emarketer is a subsidiary of Axel Springer, which also owns BI.\n\nNvidia said in a 10-Q filing that it had experienced periods when the company saw a significant amount of revenue from a limited number of customers and that \"this trend may continue.\"In 2004 \u2014 when Nvidia was bringing in a fraction of the revenue it's seeing today \u2014 the company's 10-Q filing showed that just four unnamed customers brought in 51% of its total revenue in the third quarter. At the time, Nvidia was working with PC manufacturers such as Dell and Sony to provide GPUs for computer and gaming systems.Luria said Nvidia had historically maintained the same big four customers \u2014 Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google \u2014 in its data-center segment. But they've typically been balanced by Nvidia's gaming and auto segments, which have different customers.\n\n\"Customer concentration has increased for NVDIA recently because the data-center business is now a much bigger proportion of overall revenue,\" Luria said.He said this customer concentration should be investors' primary concern for the next year or two for three key reasons:\n\n\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \n\n\n\n1. Large companies don't rely on a single sourceBig companies \"don't like being beholden to one vendor for any category,\" Luria said.\n\n\"Just like Walmart doesn't buy all of its potato chips from one vendor, Microsoft doesn't like buying its computer chips from one company,\" he said.Microsoft has made that clear before, Luria added, citing how the company gradually moved away from Intel as its sole provider for processors.2. The Nvidia demand could be temporaryAnother reason investors should be concerned is that these large Nvidia customers have indicated they're buying more GPUs without concern for their immediate return on investment, Luria said.\n\nThe companies \"have communicated that they are 'over-investing,' which means they are buying without regard for a return on investment, usually not something that lasts very long,\" Luria said.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told shareholders during an earnings call in April that any upside to his company's AI pursuits would probably \"take several years\" \u2014 so the current feeding frenzy for Nvidia chips from the large clients could be temporary.That doesn't mean Nvidia will lack customers.\n\nBourne, the Emarketer analyst, said Nvidia had a long list of clients, from countries to startups, that wanted to buy the company's chips.\"Just because currently there's these handful of companies that are really making up the lion's share of Nvidia's revenue, it doesn't mean that that's always going to be the case,\" he said. \"We might see an influx of new big customers and, of course, nation-states could be among those buying a significant number of these chips.\"3. Increasing competitionThere's also more competition coming for Nvidia.\n\nGoogle and Meta announced new in-house chips for AI development earlier this year; Microsoft unveiled its custom AI chips at the end of 2023; and Amazon is developing its own chips to avoid paying for the expensive Nvidia GPUs, BI's Eugene Kim previously reported.\"All of these companies are in various stages of deploying their own chips for AI,\" Luria said. \"Google and Amazon have been doing so the longest which means their technology is already competitive with Nvidia, and Microsoft and Meta are catching up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

before the General Court of the EU, which on September 18, 2024, upheld the finding by the European Commission that U.S. mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm abused its dominant position through predatory pricing on 3G baseband chipsets sold to Huawei and ZTE.\nThis ruling is particularly significant as it endorses the first European Commission predatory pricing decision in over 20 years and confirms Qualcomm\u2019s targeted and selective predation aimed at excluding its competitor, Icera, from the market.\nCleary acted for Icera, which filed the initial complaint against Qualcomm in 2009.\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union issued a press release which is available here. The full judgment is available here.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\nexpand\n\n\n\n\nCleary Gottlieb Women Lawyers Recognized for Top Honors\nMarch 7, 2025\n\n\nT-Mobile Acquires Blis for $175 Million\nMarch 5, 2025\n\n\nSynopsys in $10 Billion Inaugural Offering\nMarch 4, 2025\n\n\nTIM Secures Win in Italian Supreme Court\nFebruary 18, 2025\n\n\nCleary Recognized as a Leading Firm in Chambers Global 2025\nFebruary 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nView Other News\r\n            \ntrigger\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Antitrust\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Technology\r\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Login\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nTerms of Use and Legal Notices\nResponsible AI Principles\nEnvironmental Statement\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney Advertising.\n\n\r\n                \u00a9 2025 Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Alibaba Cloud, the digital technology backbone of the e-commerce giant, on Friday announced that collaboration, as it unveiled a large multimodal model (LMM) solution for automotive applications that it co-developed with Nvidia and start-up Banma Network Technology, Alibaba's intelligent cockpit solution provider, at the Apsara Conference that ran until Saturday.

LLMs are the technology underpinning generative AI services like ChatGPT. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.  This marks the first integration of Alibaba Cloud's large AI models into Nvidia's Drive automotive platform, which major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers - including Li Auto, Great Wall Motors, Geely Auto's Zeekr Intelligent Technology and the EV unit of Xiaomi - are using to power their next-generation fleets.   Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin system-on-a-chip platform serves as the brain for intelligent automated-driving systems used by major Chinese electric vehicle makers. Photo: Handout   Nvidia's model acceleration technology has already significantly reduced computational costs and minimised latency in the real-time processing of complex tasks by Alibaba Cloud's AI models. This ensures a smooth and uninterrupted intelligent experience for both drivers and passengers, according to Alibaba Cloud. \"Together with our partners, we want to empower more businesses and individuals to unlock the potential of generative AI,\" Alibaba Cloud chief technology officer Zhou Jingren said at the event.  With Qwen's advanced capabilities in handling complex inquiries and processing visual intelligence, the new LMM solution will enable in-car voice assistants to engage in dynamic, multi-turn conversations, according to Alibaba Cloud. These assistants will also be able to offer recommendations, ranging from providing information about nearby landmarks to proactively suggesting car headlights be turned on during certain conditions. As part of that LMM solution, Alibaba Cloud's Mobile Agent will enable vehicle owners to effortlessly execute voice commands, such as ordering milkshakes through a food delivery app, resulting in richer in-car experiences, according to Alibaba Cloud.   Story Continues While stringent US export controls bar Nvidia from selling its most-advanced graphics processing units to mainland Chinese firms, the US company still has a thriving business on the mainland. In its financial year ended January 28, Nvidia said China was its third-largest market.  Alibaba Cloud's resources and capabilities went on display at the three-day Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, that ran through Saturday.

Cloud computing technology enables enterprises to manage or distribute over the internet a range of software and other digital resources as an on-demand service, just like electricity from a power grid. These resources are stored inside data centres.Alibaba Cloud on Friday said its proprietary foundational model Tongyi has attracted more than 300,000 customers via its generative AI platform Model Studio, a significant jump from 90,000 revealed in May.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Nvidia has experienced an eye-popping surge in its revenue over the past year, and GPU demand continues to outstrip supply. However, some investors have begun to question how much longer Oracle and its peers can throw billions of dollars at the chip giant to fuel their AI aspirations. \nWorries that the AI train may be starting to lose steam are a key reason Nvidia stock is trading down 14.5% from its all-time high. But the market may have missed comments this month from Ellison at Oracle's financial analyst meeting that suggest more fantastic news for Nvidia's investors.\n\nOracle is nowhere close to meeting its AI infrastructure goals\nOracle's data centers are unique because they are automated. Each one is operationally identical regardless of its size, and since they don't require human workers, it allows the company to build them quickly. Plus, Oracle's RDMA (random direct memory access) GPU networking technology allows data to flow from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks.\nSince most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, Oracle's data centers can deliver considerable cost savings compared to competing infrastructure. That's why demand is soaring from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI, Cohere, and xAI. Oracle had 85 data centers up and running with 77 more under construction as of its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), but Ellison thinks it could operate as many as 2,000 in the long term. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext year, Oracle intends to offer a cluster of 131,072 GPUs, which is a big step up from its largest clusters now, at around 32,000 GPUs. But there's another difference: The new cluster will use Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips, which can perform AI inference at 30 times the pace of its flagship H100, which Oracle currently uses. Theoretically, it's going to allow developers to build the largest AI models in history.\nThat's going to benefit Nvidia significantly. It generated $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28) primarily from GPU sales, which was a 154% increase from the year-ago period. That growth rate slowed compared to previous quarters because the numbers have become so large, but Nvidia's customers are showing no signs of pulling back.\nIn fact, Oracle spent $6.9 billion on data center infrastructure in fiscal 2024, and it plans to double that figure in fiscal 2025. But it gets better.\n\nEllison's latest comments are great news for Nvidia\nDuring the analyst meeting, Ellison told the audience about a dinner he arranged with Tesla CEO (and xAI founder) Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto. He recalled himself and Musk begging Huang for more GPUs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease take our money ... take more of it. You're not taking enough. ... We need you to take more of our money. Please.\n-- Ellison's and Musk's comments to Jensen Huang over dinner, according to Ellison.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) generated $2.2 billion in revenue during Q1 (primarily from renting data center capacity to customers), which was a 46% increase from the year-ago period. However, Oracle ended the quarter with a record $99 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPOs), a whopping 53% jump. The company said it signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1, which contributed to the backlog.\nOracle can't serve all of those AI developers -- or convert its RPO into revenue -- until it brings more data centers online, hence Ellison begging Huang for more GPUs. \nTesla is in a similar position. It's battling for supremacy in the autonomous self-driving software industry, and it's trying to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online by the end of this year to further train its AI models. Tesla will spend $10 billion on that infrastructure, but it's going to need more capacity over time.\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\nNow might be a great time to buy Nvidia stock\nOracle and Tesla aren't the only companies spending big on data centers. Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures (capex) mostly relating to AI infrastructure during its fiscal 2024 year (ended June 30), and it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Similarly, Amazon's capex spending is on track to top $60 billion this calendar year. \n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Nvidia's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.20, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.7. That's expensive compared to the 30.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index, which hosts many of Nvidia's big-tech peers. \nHowever, Nvidia's fiscal 2026 will begin at the end of January 2025, and Wall Street expects the company to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share for the year. That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 28.8. In other words, investors who are willing to hold Nvidia stock for at least the next year and a half could be scooping up a bargain at its current price -- assuming Wall Street's forecast proves accurate.\nA slowdown in Nvidia's business will eventually come because the sheer magnitude of current AI spending will be very difficult to maintain over the long term. Plus, competition is slowly coming online in the GPU space, which could erode some of the company's market share in the next few years.\nHowever, based on the facts at hand today, Nvidia stock is likely a good buy at the current price. The earmarked AI spending from some of its largest customers suggests a slowdown isn't on the immediate horizon.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

For example, the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant is reopening in Pennsylvania in order to exclusively sell power to Microsoft to enable its AI ambitions.\nHyperscale Data Center Capacity \u2018Continues To Balloon\u2019\nThe market for building and equipping cloud-related data centers has received a huge boost from products required to support AI functionality, and growth rates there have for once surpassed cloud service growth rates.\nIn the first half of 2024, cloud services sales growth averaged 21 percent compared to first half 2023. Comparatively, spending on public and private cloud data centers grew by an average of 30 percent.\n\u201cDemand for hyperscale data center capacity continues to balloon,\u201d said Dinsdale.\nThe operational capacity of these huge hyperscaler data center networks grew by 24 percent in the first half of 2024 year over year.\nAdditionally, the size of their pipeline for future data centers grew by 47 percent as they continue to ramp up investments for the long-term, according to Synergy data.\nAmerica \u2018Remains A Center Of Gravity\u2019\nSynergy\u2019s market data includes first half market stats for cloud infrastructure services, SaaS, data center hardware and software, data center leasing and hyperscale infrastructure.\nGeographically, while cloud markets are growing strongly in all regions of the world, the United States remains a center of gravity, according to Synergy research.\nIn the first half of 2024, America accounted for 44 percent of all cloud service revenues, 53 percent of hyperscale data center capacity, and 47 percent of the market for cloud data center hardware and software.\nAcross all service and infrastructure markets, the vast majority of leading players are U.S.-based companies. Chinese-based companies accounted for 8 percent of all cloud service revenues and 16 percent of hyperscale data center capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As interest in machine learning began to peak in late 2022 with the release of the ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, so did Nvidia\u2019s financial results. Analysts project Nvidia will report $126 billion in sales and $67 billion in net profits in its fiscal year ending January. 2025, eye popping growth from the $$27 billion in sales and $4 billion profit it booked in the fiscal year ending January 2023. Nvidia stock has skyrocketed as demand for its AI systems soared, with shares up about 700% over the last two years.\nSurprising Fact\nNvidia\u2019s $216 billion jump in market capitalization Wednesday is the latest major swing for the volatile stock, as it is on pace for its 24th trading session of a more than 5% gain or loss of 2024. In comparison, Microsoft and Apple, the only two companies valued higher than Nvidia, have registered just a pair of 5% or more daily moves this year, combined.\n\nForbes Valuation\nHuang, Nvidia\u2019s largest individual shareholder, enjoyed the largest bump to his net worth of any billionaire in the world Wednesday, gaining $6 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 real-time tracker. The Nvidia cofounder and longtime CEO is the 14th-richest person in the world.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cThe days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over,\u201d Huang proclaimed Wednesday, referencing the upending of traditional workflow from generative AI.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

The stock pared losses after the bell, down about 1.4% to around $120. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.72 -2.81 (-2.35%)  As of 3:07:41 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Bloomberg reported Friday afternoon that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders \u2014 rather than Nvidia\u2019s popular GPUs \u2014 amid heightened trade tensions with the US. Nvidia shares ended the day down 2.2% to $121 and fell further early Monday. Meanwhile, Chinese AI chipmaker Cambricon Technologies (688256.SS) surged 20% in Monday trading.  Nvidia did not immediately respond to questions from Yahoo Finance. Meanwhile, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) dropped 1.2% early Monday. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell modestly, down 0.6% to about $163. Qualcomm (QCOM) shares were flat, while Intel (INTC) fell nearly 2% to around $23. Memory chipmaker and Nvidia partner Micron (MU) fell 3.4% to about $104. The US enacted tougher export controls on AI chips to China in late 2022 \u2014 and has continued to tighten those rules in an attempt to hinder China\u2019s ability to surge ahead in the so-called AI arms race. Nvidia has felt the impact: Sales to China made up 14% of data center revenue during the company\u2019s fiscal year ended Jan. 28, 2024, compared to 19% the prior year. Nvidia has responded by attempting to work around those roadblocks by creating specific versions of its chips for China, which comply with the stricter controls. Its recently launched \u201cH20\u201d Hopper chips for China are expected to generate $12 billion in revenue for the company this year. Nvidia is also set to launch a version of its latest Blackwell chip, called \u201cB20,\u201d for China. A release date has not been set. In the meantime, the black market for Nvidia chips has taken off.   Ups and downs: Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, keynote speaker at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS Nvidia sales in China have recovered in recent quarters. Revenue from sales in China totaled about $3.7 billion in the most recent quarter ended July 28, up 33.8% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg estimates. Nvidia shares are up 144% since the start of the year. \"If the US more strongly enforces the limits on sales to China, and China more strictly enforces the limits on its own companies, it would have a very detrimental impact on Nvidia,\" D.A. Davidson senior analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance Monday. Analysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite trade tensions and historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.   Story Continues \"Unless the economy craters or we go to war with somebody, Nvidia is strong for 12 months, at least,\" said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy.Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance that there is \u201cstrong optimism right now from the top leaders\u201d in the semiconductor sector. He noted that Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June.  StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.

This allows for diverse and redundant processing of sensor data from the L60\u2019s vision-based sensor suite of high-definition cameras (with maximum forward detection of 687 meters) and 4D radar (with maximum detection range of 370 meters).\nThe automotive-grade NVIDIA DRIVE Orin runs NVIDIA DriveOS, an operating system for safe, AI-defined vehicles, and is widely used by leading global automakers, including in NIO\u2019s ET7 sedan and its ET5 and ES7 models.\nNVIDIA DRIVE Orin enables highly automated driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, along with other features that can be updated via over-the-air software updates.\nBold Design Built to Go the Distance\nThe ONVO L60 embodies NIO\u2019s commitment to innovative design and user-centric features, blending sleek style with cutting-edge technology.\nThe L60 was developed to elevate driving experiences by incorporating six critical features: comprehensive safety, spacious comfort, smart cabins with immersive digital experiences, impressive mileage range with convenient recharging, superior ride and handling, and advanced assisted driving capabilities.\n\nThe L60 base model (which costs approximately \u00a5149, 900 yuan, equivalent to $21,000) comes without a battery, allowing users to opt for NIO\u2019s battery-as-a-service option, which is used by 70% of NIO customers. ONVO vehicles are compatible with NIO\u2019s battery swap network, which includes more than 2,500 Power Swap Stations and is expected to continue expanding throughout China.\nThe launch of the ONVO L60 marks the latest in NIO and NVIDIA\u2019s decade of collaboration. With the integration of NVIDIA DRIVE, the ONVO L60 is poised to deliver an advanced driving experience at an affordable price.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The CUDA baseband platform supports inline GPU acceleration of Layer 1 PHY and Layer 2 MAC. That fulfils Nvidia\u2019s previous strategic direction to move up the RAN stack within a converged accelerator.\nNvidia\u2019s DOCA GPUNetIO\u00a0enables the removal of the CPU from the critical path. Used in Aerial, it provides IO and packet processing by exchanging packets directly between GPU memory and the DPU. Nvidia said this enables fast IO processing and direct-memory access (DMA) technology to \u201cunleash the full potential of inline acceleration\u201d.\nIts cloud-native architecture allows RAN functions to be realized as microservices in containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes\nThe second and third elements that Nvidia announced were its Aerial AI Radio Frameworks, software to develop and train models to improve RAN performance and the Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin \u2013 a simulated environment that incorporates the Aerial Cuda Accelerate RAN that mirrors real world deployments.\nThe compute for the platform is ARC-1, built on the Nvidia GB NGX server, with CUDA accelerate runtime libraries upon which it can place the RAN software. The server is formed of a Grace CPU and Blackwell CPU\u00a0 with NVLink and a fronthaul NIC that is O-RAN compliant and can connect to an O-RU over traditional eCPRI.\n\nThe ARC-1 can also be connected via Nvidia\u2019s cloud orchestration layer to enable its GPUs to be leveraged and used by every node in that network.\nRonnie Vashista, SVP Telecom at NVIDIA, said, \u201cThink of this as the DU, CU, Distributed UPF and orchestration, all on a computer that can connect not just in the traditional method of a RAN, but also enabling GPUs to be connected.\u201d\nVashista said that the platform can also be deployed at different points of the operator network topology.\n\u201cBecause of the capabilities of the fronthaul, and the unified memory architecture of the Grace-Blackwell NVLink, you can now run high performance RAN algorithms across the NV link wth very high avalability.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the compute platform that allows high performance RAN to be implemented in a form factor at the cell site as well as at a distributed rack system or centralised site.\u201d\nVashista said that despite the expense of high end GPU-based platforms, and the fact that many operators have already invested billions in 5G, the Nvidia platform would make CFOS \u201cvery happy\u201d by changing the dynamics of the telecom in terms of TCO and return on capital.\nThat\u2019s because the same infrastructure can be used to support AI traffic, enabling monetisation of the network platform, something operators have not been able to achieve before.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been RAN and there\u2019s been compute infrastructure. We see the essential need for these to be converged and combined in one, called AI RAN,\u201d he added.\n\nThe underlying driver for this investment, Vashista said, would be the growth of AI and AI apps that require strict throughput, latency and jitter KPIs. Intelligent connectivity that can apply real time decision making will need to be distributed across the network topology, from a base station to a local site to a centralised cloud.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Nvidia takes care to position its software defined RAN as 6G capable \u2013 putting it into an investment framework to support advanced 5G, vRAN refresh projects and also then 6G.\nThe technology will be tested out by T-Mobile, Ericsson and Nokia with the foundation of a new AI-RAN Innovation Centre. Along with Softbank, and existing Nvidia partner for vRAN, T-Mobile was one of the founder operators named at the launch of the AI RAN Alliance.\nOEMs like Ericsson and Nokia could build their own stack on top of Aerial, Vashista said, or they can use Aerial PHY as their own software PHY. This, of course, is a critical question. What is the route to market for Nvidia\u2019s vRAN supporting hardware, and its own vRAN software? Will the major vendors want to re-build around the cuBB, or rather view it as just another potential means of accelerating their own vRAN workloads?\nTo date, most of Nvidia\u2019s development of its vRAN platform has been with O-RAN new entrants such as Mavenir, which has worked with Softbank, and Fujitsu, which actually has a commercial deployment with NTT DoCoMo. Nokia said in February this year that it would not, for now, be adopting Nvidia for L1 acceleration. But it did say it saw potential for using Nvidia\u2019s Grace CPU \u201csuperchip\u201d for Layer 2 and above in Cloud RAN deployments.\nThis week\u2019s product announcement is new, but it is very much in line with Nvidia\u2019s stated ambition, tracked over the past few years on TMN.\nNVIDIA ON TMN:\nIn 2019 Ericsson and Nvidia said they would explore the potential use of Nvidia GPUs for vRAN processing (\u201cNvidia aims guns at Intel with GPU for vRAN play\u201d)\nAs we know \u2013 those were initial conversations as Ericsson assessed options for a potential virtualisation of RAN workloads. And they didn\u2019t seem to go very far as Ericsson continued to design its own (Intel-based) silicon solutions for its RAN platforms, and then integrated its Cloud RAN with Intel based solutions from Dell (\u201cEricsson firms up Cloud RAN partnership with Dell)\u00a0and with HPE.\nBut Ericsson has popped up again this week as a named partner with Nvidia for the innovation lab at T-Mobile, following its signup for the AI-RAN Alliance earlier in the year. What is in doubt is the extent to which Ericsson will commit to adopting Nvidia\u2019s built in vRAN libraries, or whether it will see the Nvidia hardware as just another potential accelerator option, albeit a fully inline version. Certainly Ericsson\u2019s public strategy is to be agnostic to the underlying hardware platform.\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind (again) what\u00a0M\u00e5rten Lerner, Head of Cloud RAN\u00a0at Ericsson,\u00a0told TMN at MWC 2023.\n\u201cI think the difference is that we want to become fully portable between different hardware platforms. If we look at the alternatives out on the market, and I think [Nokia\u2019s] SmartNIC is one way of expressing it, there is also an acceleration component, which means that you connect again the software to the hardware in a way that we have initially taken a step to go away.\n\u201cSo our solution is completely disaggregated, while some of the other companies are integrating their L1 acceleration with their L1 software. And I think this has not been fully understood in the industry about the portability of the solution, because if you then go with smartNIC or their acceleration, you\u2019re still becoming proprietary to that L1, versus us being agnostic across the different hardware platforms that we support.\u201d\nThe new platform is different again. Could Ericsson achieve its ambition of being hardware independent whilst hosting its own software on a platform which Nvidia has developed with its own L1 and L2 libraries?\nComing a little forward. In 2021 Nvidia announced extended support for Arm-based CPUs \u2013 with the NVIDIA Aerial A100 AI-on-5G platform.\nNvidia said this would \u201ccreate a simplified path to building and deploying self-hosted vRAN that converges AI and 5G capabilities across private enterprises, network equipment companies, software makers and telecommunications services providers.\u201d\nThe platform incorporated 16 Arm Cortex-A78 processors with the NVIDIA BlueField-3 A100, an AI software library.\nFast forward to March 2023 and Nvidia and Softbank established a partnership to explore a platform that would host vRAN as well as AI apps.\nTMN\u00a0reported on work Softbank was doing with Nvidia on the use of Nvidia GPUs to support a Mavenir vRAN, MEC workloads and core network software from within the same server and Nividia GPU. Softbank said that Distributed Units (DU) from Mavenir and MEC AI applications were working on the same architecture server. Nvidia said this enabled much higher utilisation by dynamically allocating GPU resources on demand, so that a telco could run AI and other apps on the same GPUs and servers as it runs its vRAN. (sound familiar?)\nSoftBank said its \u201cAI-on-5G Lab\u201d research facility consisted of NVIDIA\u2019s hardware, vRAN and AI processing middleware, vRAN software from Mavenir, core network software, AI image processing application software on MEC, and physical Radio Units (RU) provided by Foxconn Technology Group. The Mavenir Distributed Units (DU) and MEC AI applications work on the same architecture server. As we said at the time, \u201cThis is a key vision for Nvidia, which says it can enabled much higher utilisation of resources by dynamically allocating GPU resources on demand, so that a telco could run AI and other apps on the same GPUs and servers as it runs its vRAN.\u201d\nA new platform announced in May 2023 built on that multi-tenant vision, with SoftBank saying it planned to roll out at new, distributed AI data centres across Japan, uses Nvidia\u2019s GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip. Most of the focus was on the benefits to SoftBank of running vRAN workloads on the platform, with passing mention that these workloads might, themselves, benefit from AI applications.\nThat solution was based on Nvidia\u2019s Grace Hopper chip with its BlueField-3 data processing units to accelerate software-defined 5G vRAN workloads on a 1U MGX-based server design. As we\u2019ve seen, the MGX is a modular reference architecture that also underpins the new ARC-1 launch.\nIn February 2023 Fujitsu launched a vDU and vCU based on Nvidia technology, developed as part of NTT DoCoMo\u2019s \u201c5G Open RAN Ecosystem\u201d (OREC) \u2013 now renamed OREX.\nThe solution applies NVIDIA\u2019s GPU processing engine \u201cNVIDIA A100X\u201d to the physical layer processing at the base station, enabling parallel processing of vRAN and edge applications on GPU hardware resources in an all-in-one configuration that allows each function to be built on the same server. Fujitsu and NVIDIA\u2019s integration formed Type 1 or OREC\u2019s then blueprints, based on a Wind River virtualisation platform in Intel-based hardware from Fujitsu as well as Fujitsu\u2019s vRAN software.\nThe companies said in September 2023 that they had commercialised the solution, stating, \u201cThe 5G Open RAN solution is the first 5G vRAN for telecom commercial deployment using the NVIDIA Aerial platform. The platform brings together the NVIDIA Aerial vRAN stack for 5G, AI frameworks, accelerated compute infrastructure, and long-term software support and maintenance. It delivers innovative and transformational new capabilities for telco operators.\u201d\nBeyond Layer 1\nAlso in March 2023 we outlined how Nvidias ambitions extended beyond virtualising L1 RAN workloads. At that point, Nvidia\u2019s product platform was its A100X, a GPU+DPU converged card that supported inline L1 processing, providing the hardware layer for Nvidia\u2019s Aerial SDK \u2013 a containerised application framework for vRAN and a vDU. Nvidia also had a dedicated fronthaul switch and said it was working with partners to design GPU-based orchestration and RAN automation apps (RIC).\nNvidia was promising that the solution used a standard 2U COTS node to support a 100MHz 4T4R product. A 32T32R version was said to be due later on in\u00a0 2023, with a 64T64R version also following based on a quarterly release cycle.\nRajesh Gadiyar, Vice President, Telco and Edge Architecture, NVIDIA, said then that what was needed was a \u201cparadigm\u201d change to deliver innovations for the vRAN infrastructure of tomorrow. First, that meant bringing AI to the wireless network, enabling solutions like RIC and SMO. Secondly, Nvidia would push beyond Layer 1 in the RAN stack, targeting multi cell scheduler, channel estimation and beamforming within a converged accelerator.\u201d This it seems to have done with its L2 cuMAC support in AI-Aerial.\n\u201cNow, that does not mean that we are running the whole layer two on the GPU, but it\u2019s primarily focusing on the scheduling problem and accelerating the scheduling. So that the the layer two stack and the scheduler can utilise the radio resources more efficiently,\u201d Gadiyar said at the time.\nThirdly it was pusing for RAN in a multi-tenant cloud. This, it said, would help with the capital outlays required, and allow operators to scale up over time. And at times of under-utilisation it can use the GPU infrastructure for running other apps.\nNvidia vRAN in 2024\nBring it forward to 2024 and in March\u2019s GTC, Nvidia kicked off with the capabilities of its new Blackwell GPU. One of three key use cases for Blackwell that Nvidia highlighted within telco was vRAN (the other two were the use of Gen AI for internal ops, and the creation of AI factories).\nAgain, Nvidia had its story worked out \u2013 use the infrastructure from potential money-raising AI factories to support vRAN workloads. Same story as this week\u2019s messaging.\nAs Vashishta said at the time, \u201cJust think about the billions of dollars in a RAN. Now your investment in your AI factory enables that workload to run in that factory. This we call AI and RAN. We\u2019re working with partners in the AI RAN Alliance to flush out how this infrastructure is deployed and how the two workloads of AI and RAN can be orchestrated to work together.\u201d\nAnd yes, 2024 also saw the formation of the AI-RAN Alliance, in which Nvidia is taking a lead to integrate AI with cellular technology. Announced partners included Nokia and Ericsson, as well as T-Mobile, and perhaps it is in this light that we should view the latest announcement with T-Mobile and those two vendors.\nWhile Nokia was interested in using Nvidia\u2019s for Layer 2 and above in Cloud RAN deployments, the vendor also pointed out, as did Marvell, that Marvell already has a ML/AI Accelerator capability built in to its Octeon 10 chip (used by Nokia for L1 acceleration). Marvell said that it was open sourcing this ML/AI Accelerator Software.\nThrough contributions accepted to the Apache TVM (Tensor Virtual Machine) project, developers can use Open-source tools to build machine learning (ML) models that can be executed the ML/AI acceleration engine.\nA Marvell spokesperson said to TMN that vendors to this point had not done a lot with the AI/ML capability that is built into the Octeon 10 CN106 chipset, which was its first SKU in the Octeon 10 family and contains up to 24 Arm Neoverse N2 server processor cores, inline AI/ML acceleration, an integrated 1-terabit switch and vector packet processing (VPP) hardware accelerators.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been there since 2021,\u201d the spokesperson said, \u201cso that if a carrier or OEM had an AI application to run it wouldn\u2019t need a GPU.\u201d\nMarvell\u2019s announcement was also welcomed by Nokia, saying it was \u201cthe first vendor to incorporate AI/ML into our ReefShark SoCs and AirScale portfolio\u201d and stating that this would \u201cput it at the forefront of bringing machine learning technology to our customers and exploring its enormous possibilities ahead of the 6G era.\u201d\nYou can see our breakdown of AI-RAN Alliance demos, including participation from Softbank, Fujitsu Supermicro, Radisys.\u00a0\n\n\nTags\n\n\nCloud RAN\n\n\nEricsson\n\n\nNokia\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nvRAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated News\n\n\n\nNvidia forms 6G un-Alliance to expand mobile network presence\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n18 March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nAI-RAN creates a new dynamic, despite doubts\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n12 March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS says industry needs its pre-integrated RAN server\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n11 March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for 6G at MWC\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n9 March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung Networks\u2019 plan for open and AI-led growth\n\nBy The Mobile Network\n7 March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvancing AI-RAN at Mobile World Congress 2025\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n3 March 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel keeps up the vRAN fight with XEON 6 SoC\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n24 February 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nEricsson pre-MWC radio shower promises open benefits\n\nBy Keith Dyer\n14 February 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nRoom for another one?

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?Join todayInnovation /Artificial IntelligenceWhy Nvidia triggered a stock market freakoutWhat does Nvidia\u2019s massive stock sell-off tell us about the economy?by  Ellen IoanesUpdated Sep 5, 2024, 3:00 PM UTCFacebookLinkNvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California.  Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesEllen Ioanes covers breaking and general assignment news as the weekend reporter at Vox. She previously worked at Business Insider covering the military and global conflicts.Nvidia, the world\u2019s leading AI chip manufacturer, sparked a global stock market downturn Wednesday, with indexes falling in Asia, Europe, and the United States.After Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the US Justice Department issued Nvidia a subpoena as part of an antitrust investigation, investors sold $279 billion worth of shares \u2014 amounting to 9.5 percent of the company\u2019s stock. On Wednesday, a spokesperson denied that the company had received the subpoena, but said Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201dStill, the sell-off is bad news for Nvidia, and it renews existing concerns about the strength of the AI sector and the US economy more broadly. That one company was able to have such an impact on global stock prices is a testament to Nvidia\u2019s size and reach. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world. Because of its dominance, its success \u2014 or failure \u2014 can shift the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock index, where it is listed. And because it\u2019s so entangled with other tech companies, when it falls, so does the stock of its partners, like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which pulled down markets overseas. In the US, Nvidia pushed sell-offs throughout the entire tech industry. Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel shares were down as of Wednesday afternoon, though Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices saw gains. \u201cOne of the big risks is that you have this market concentration, and all it takes is those names to be volatile, for it to feed through to the entire market,\u201d Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer at investment firm St. James\u2019s Place, told Reuters Wednesday. While Nvidia triggered this week\u2019s stock market slump, there are a few other factors that have investors rattled. Recent concerns about China\u2019s sluggish economy are putting a damper on a wide array of businesses, including an oil industry already struggling with falling prices. Weak manufacturing in the US, along with some higher prices in that sector, are part of the equation as well.Nvidia\u2019s troubles come amid rising uncertainty about the AI sectorInvestors have significant concerns about whether the US tech sector is headed in the right direction. Questions about whether Nvidia is overvalued, and about the wisdom of investing so heavily in AI technology, have dogged the tech sector for months. Analysts from JPMorgan Asset Management and Blackrock cautioned earlier this week that massive spending on AI hasn\u2019t been justified because the technology has limited applications outside the tech sector. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have ignored that advice, spending as much as 40 percent of their hardware budgets \u2014 tens of billions of dollars \u2014 on Nvidia products to accelerate their own AI products. But that has investors worried that tech companies are betting too much on a future that may never come. And that if these giant companies have made a wrong bet, they may drag the stock market down with them.\u201c[Tech companies are] all kind of saying, \u2018Look, we\u2019re not going to be on the wrong side of this. We\u2019re going to invest,\u2019\u201d Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a global technology research and advisory firm, told Vox. \u201cBut I\u2019m not hearing for what, or where this provides the return. And I think there\u2019s a little bit of hesitation on [Wall Street] \u2014 people want to know where that return comes from.\u201dAll of this \u2014 from concerns about China\u2019s economy to the strategy of tech companies \u2014 is swirling at a time when some financial and economic experts are warning the US could be in danger of a recession. And this week\u2019s turmoil has only intensified concerns that these experts might be right.What does Nvidia\u2019s slide mean for the economy?There\u2019s no question that Wednesday\u2019s sell-off is concerning, but it\u2019s impossible to say now whether it can tell us anything about the danger of a recession.Stock market performance isn\u2019t the only \u2014 or even the best \u2014 indicator of economic health. Stocks rebounded after last month\u2019s early, volatile sell-off thanks to the news that the Federal Reserve would be lowering interest rates, making credit cheaper and hopefully making it easier for people to make big purchases and for businesses to hire and to make other investments. The Fed is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter of a point at its meeting this month, which may help ease some recession fears. But that alone isn\u2019t likely to make those concerns go away completely.Though the US isn\u2019t currently in a recession \u2014 traditionally defined as negative gross domestic product growth over two successive quarters \u2014 there\u2019s concern that one could still develop because of high inflation and high interest rates, which could curtail production and lead to higher joblessness rates. Nvidia\u2019s fall from grace this week probably isn\u2019t the ultimate indicator of whether the economy will go into a recession, and it may not even last that long. But it does say something about the markets\u2019 dependency on the tech sector \u2014 and it\u2019s only the latest reminder of how much uncertainty remains about the US economy.Update, September 5, 11 am: This story was originally published on September 4 and has been updated to include Nividia\u2019s spokesperson denying the company received a subpoena.See More: AntitrustArtificial IntelligenceBig TechEmerging TechFuture of WorkInfluenceInnovationMark ZuckerbergMetaMicrosoftTech policyTechnologyTechnology & MediaTim CookMost PopularThis is why Kamala Harris really lostWhat can be done if Trump is openly defying the courts?Take a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordThe alarmingly high stakes in an easy Supreme Court voting rights caseMeasles is back \u2014 and more dangerous than you think.

For over a century, the company has solved complex challenges and advanced scientific discovery. Current projects include sending humans to Mars, returning them to the Moon, and better detecting, predicting, and fighting wildfires.\nWith 122,000 employees globally, Lockheed Martin is scaling AI enterprise-wide to drive efficiency and innovation. They currently integrate AI into hundreds of projects, enhancing customer programs and optimizing internal business operations. To further accelerate digital transformation, they established the Lockheed Martin AI Center (LAIC) in 2021 to reduce barriers for AI deployment. Their AI factory initiative is an integration of infrastructure and MLOps and generative AI tools. It empowers engineers and developers to deliver automated and repeatable AI-powered capabilities into high-assurance applications\u2014which propels AI-enabled solutions from prototype to production rapidly and at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockheed Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockheed Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Centralizing AI Infrastructure to Overcome Fragmentation and Inefficiencies\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping safe, secure, and trustworthy AI is a White House executive order to which Lockheed Martin adheres. \"Due to our strict data governance guidelines, it's crucial that our data remains on premises at Lockheed Martin or within classified environments. Access controls ensure that people only see the data they need and can secure datasets within their workspaces,\" says Greg Forrest, Director of AI Foundations at Lockheed Martin.\nForrest adds, \u201cIn addition to data governance and security, teams encountered challenges stemming from fragmented processes, limited automation, and separate compute resources, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and outdated compute resources. Duplicate work and inconsistent practices emerged from the lack of a unified AI strategy and clear vendor management.\u201d\nTo support the diverse set of use cases across the business, the LAIC sought to centralize compute resources, MLOps tools, and best practices via their own AI factory built on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD reference architecture for training and deployment, enabling them to adhere to the government\u2019s AI ethical principles while leveraging best-of-breed technology solutions across the entire technology stack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s goal was to align their infrastructure, streamline their cloud resources, and proliferate best practices across teams.\nTo achieve this, they established the Lockheed Martin AI Factory, centralizing compute resources, MLOps tools, and best practices with a customized MLOps platform built on top of DGX SuperPOD, providing solutions for teams to build and deploy trustworthy AI at scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers can now securely access GPU resources and have their environments up and running in minutes and reduce training times from weeks to days.\nCentralizing generative AI workloads on the DGX SuperPOD enables the company to leverage the full power of specialized infrastructure and reduce the scattered overhead costs of cloud environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockheed Martin is using DGX SuperPOD to train and customize models and host them on their internal AI factory. This setup supports the rapid development of AI applications, such as internal chatbots and coding assistants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockheed Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Quick Access to Secure Computing and Shared Best Practices Boost Developer Productivity\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most significant benefits we observed after implementing our AI factory was a substantial increase in developer productivity,\u201d said Bryan Donovan, Technical Lead of AI Foundations at Lockheed Martin. \u201cPreviously, setting up a development environment on local laptops or workstations was a challenging task due to stringent security constraints, often taking several weeks to complete. Now, with the AI factory powered by DGX SuperPOD, developers can request GPU resources and have their environments up and running in just a few minutes.\u201d\nAccess to GPUs with high-speed interconnects offered by the DGX SuperPOD has enabled teams to leverage capabilities that were previously unaffordable for individual programs. Training processes that once took weeks are now reduced to days. Forrest commented, \u201cAdditionally, our AI factory enables us to share best practices and expertise across Lockheed Martin. We have codified AI best practices into a set of reusable components, pipelines, and playbooks, further improving developer productivity.\u201d\nCentralizing compute via the Lockheed Martin AI Factory has led to significant cost savings. Tokens are created when a model breaks down text into smaller units like words, parts of words, or characters, and they are used in the training process to convert textual data into numerical data that the model can understand and learn from. \u201cUsing APIs via public cloud requires purchasing tokens to cover the computational costs, but with our on-prem AI factory, we handle tokenization, training, and deployment in-house,\u201d said Forrest. \u201cOur DGX SuperPOD helps us process over one billion tokens per week, enabling fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), or inference on our large language models (LLMs). This solution avoids the escalating costs and significant limitations of fees based on token usage.\u201d\nIn addition to their DGX SuperPOD, the team still leverages burst-scaling to cloud environments for temporal needs and for non-classified training and data handling. The on-premises DGX systems allow Lockheed Martin to control specific data types and telemetry in a secure environment. \u201cWith approved internal data centers, developers can immediately utilize sensitive data, ensuring security and agility across all use cases without waiting for additional approvals. This allows for greater flexibility and faster deployment of AI solutions,\u201d said Donovan.\n\u201cLockheed Martin has a tremendous amount of diverse data types being processed for various AI applications, including time series data, signal intelligence, geospatial data, text, image, and video. The DGX SuperPOD supports a wide range of use cases from data analytics to large-scale inference, on the same platform, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs,\u201d Forrest added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur DGX SuperPOD helps us process over one billion tokens per week\u2026 This solution avoids the escalating costs and significant limitations of fees based on token usage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Forrest Director of AI Foundations, Lockheed Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Empowering 7,000 Users Without Trade-Offs in Experimentation, Cost, or Data Security\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, 7,000 engineers and developers access Lockheed Martin\u2019s AI Factory, powered by DGX SuperPOD, to support programs across all of Lockheed Martin and produce thousands of automated pipelines and millions of weekly API requests. More than 1,100 trainees have enhanced their AI knowledge through NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute (DLI), while thousands of others have completed additional training programs curated by the Lockheed AI Center (LAIC). These programs have equipped participants with technical expertise and hands-on experience using industry-standard tools and frameworks.\n\"We went from having scattered GPUs on local ad hoc infrastructure, static and underutilized cloud resources, and even training directly on laptops, to a centralized platform, where we don't have to trade-off experimentation for cost or data security,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cThis shift accelerates our workflow.\" The AI factory supports various generative AI workloads, RAG, fine-tuning of LLMs and internal chatbots and coding assistants.\n\u201cFor instance, we have made proposal writing more efficient. As a government contractor, we read a lot of proposals and have a huge proposal repository,\u201d Forrest commented. \u201cWe host an open-source large language model on DGX SuperPOD and applied RAG on Lockheed Martin proposals. This allows us to rapidly generate new proposals with generative AI, summarizing past work and creating new content.\n\u201cAnother example is Lockheed Martin Text Navigator, a large language model chat interface that can summarize large bodies of text, analyze research papers, generate strategy ideas, and produce and troubleshoot code embedded in IDE\u2019s,\u201d said Forrest.\u00a0\nLockheed Martin Text Navigator is used by thousands of employees for daily productivity tasks. Hosted internally on the DGX SuperPOD and deployed securely through Lockheed Martin MLOps and generative AI platform, Text Navigator enhances efficiency and supports a wide range of functions across the business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe went from having scattered GPUs\u2026 to a centralized platform, where we don't have to trade-off experimentation for cost or data security.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBryan Donovan Technical Lead of AI Foundations, Lockheed Martin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t    \t\n                    Looking Ahead\n\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockheed Martin leverages and continues to scale out the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD within their AI factory to train and fine-tune open-source models and develop new language models for specialized applications. Training and inference are conducted on the DGX SuperPOD, utilizing NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\u2122 and NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 Framework, which are included with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, as well as CUDA\u00ae and pre-integrated NVIDIA images.\n\u201cLockheed Martin's domain expertise, combined with NVIDIA's cutting-edge infrastructure, is revolutionizing the way we approach enterprise and mission requirements through AI, enabling us to tackle complex challenges with unparalleled speed, accuracy and insight,\" said Matt Wittstock, Lockheed Martin AI Infrastructure Lead.\nThis integrated approach accelerates AI development and deployment, allowing Lockheed Martin to efficiently deliver advanced AI solutions to its customers. Currently, they have consolidated 30+ models on their on-premises infrastructure using their AI factory, and the number is growing.\nToday, Lockheed Martin experiences full utilization and occasional overutilization of their on-premises hardware. With 122,000 employees, and a growing number who now use generative AI daily, they already handle millions of API calls weekly.

Its 9.5% share price decline shaved a stunning $279 billion off the company\u2019s value, far outpacing the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta in 2022.\n    \n\n            To put that shocking decline into context, only 27 companies on the planet are worth as much as Nvidia lost in value Tuesday. That $279 billion evaporation is worth more than all the shares of some of America\u2019s biggest companies, including McDonald\u2019s, Chevron and Pepsi.\n    \n\n            CEO Jensen Huang, who is Nvidia\u2019s largest individual shareholder (and fifth-largest overall, counting institutional investors like BlackRock) personally lost $10 billion in wealth Tuesday from Nvidia\u2019s sharp tumble.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has ridden the AI hype wave to become one of the most valuable brands on the planet, achieving a $3 trillion valuation that puts it among giants like Apple and Microsoft.\n\nAnn Wang/Reuters\n\n\n\n\nRelated article\nThe thrill of AI is fading \u2014 and Wall Street is getting a little more clear-eyed about its actual value\n\n\n\n\n            The company has been in decline since June 18, when it topped $3.3 trillion in value \u2014 the highest for any public company. As the US economy begins to show some signs of stress, investors have grown skeptical of Nvidia and other AI stocks\u2019 sky-high valuations. Stock traders are worried that potential weakness in the economy could make companies think twice before investing in the promising but still risky and unproven technology.\n    \n\n            Despite blockbuster earnings last week, Nvidia\u2019s somewhat more tepid outlook disappointed investors who were looking for more upside, and the stock fell.\n    \n\n            Nvidia has tumbled more than 20% since its June 18 peak. Microsoft, which has made huge bets on AI technology, has fallen 12% from its most recent peak. And TSMC, Nvidia\u2019s chip manufacturer, has plunged 18% since mid-July.\n    \n\n            Meanwhile, Intel, once the world biggest chipmaker, has endured a 59% decline in its share price this year. That company faces its own unique challenges in its bid to remake itself and get into the AI game.\n    \n\n        Potential legal problems\n\n\n            But Nvidia may face a different set of problems: The government is reportedly investigating it over potential antitrust violations.\n    \n\n            Much of Tuesday\u2019s sharp decline was because the US Justice Department reportedly sent it a subpoena as part of an antitrust probe, according to Bloomberg. CNN could not independently verify the subpoena, and the Department of Justice declined to comment directly on a potential antitrust investigation.\n    \n\n            Nvidia on Wednesday afternoon said it has not received a subpoena from the Justice Department.\n    \n\n            \u201cWe have inquired with the US Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,\u201d an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cNonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d\n    \n\n            The Biden administration has been going hard after tech titans, launching probes and lobbing charges against Apple, Google and Amazon, among others. It\u2019s unclear whether a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump administration would continue those cases, but both have criticized tech companies for various reasons during their campaigns.\n    \n\n            Nvidia lost another 1.7% Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite, which tanked more than 3% Tuesday, fell 0.3% Wednesday.\n    \n\n            Still, AI bulls continue to believe in Nvidia. The stock remains up 118% this year and has a $2.7 trillion market valuation \u2014 a close third behind Apple and Microsoft. Huang said last week that demand for its latest \u201cBlackwell\u201d AI chips \u201cfar exceeds its supply.\u201d And even as competition grows, demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips is growing, too.\n    \n\n            And the investments are paying off \u2014 so far, at least \u2014 Huang claims.\n    \n\n            \u201cPeople who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,\u201d Huang said last week, noting that the company\u2019s new graphics processing units, the GPU chips that power AI, process data so efficiently that they end up saving clients money quickly.\n    \n\n            That\u2019s why bulls like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives believe Nvidia\u2019s stock decline presents a buying opportunity.\n    \n\n            \u201cNvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its GPUs have become the new oil and gold in the IT landscape,\u201d Ives said Tuesday in a note to investors.\n    \n\n\u2013 CNN\u2019s Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report\n\n\n  Correction: Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described TSMC's relationship with Nvidia.

He also argued that AI could be integrated into the grid to deliver power more efficiently.\n\n\nU.S. data center load is expected to grow to nearly 21 GW this year, up from 19 GW in 2023, according to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report this month. Data center electricity demand across the U.S. is expected to climb to 35 GW by the end of this decade, according to the FERC report.\u00a0Huang said this growth should be seen as a sign of prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nAI should be seen as a potential climate solution, Huang said Friday during a webinar hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\u201cUsing artificial intelligence to solve problems will use less energy than using calculation to solve problems,\u201d\u00a0Huang said.\nFor example, he said that an AI model can predict the weather a thousand times more efficiently than conventional computing. Although it will take a significant amount of energy up-front to train the AI, he said, once that model is created it could be used repeatedly all around the world, ultimately resulting in energy savings relative to conventional computing processes.\nAI could be used to upgrade the grid and enable it to \u201credirect energy in a smarter way,\u201d and could perhaps improve carbon capture and sequestration technologies, Huang said. However, he acknowledged that any efficiency gains created by AI would likely be absorbed as society assigns a greater number of tasks to AI.\n\u201cSociety will apply the energy saved to something else, and we call that prosperity and economic growth, the improvement of quality of life, which we want to see,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, on an absolute basis, I hope that the population of earth consumes more energy someday. Because it's directly related to quality of life. We want everyone to enjoy this quality of life.\u201d\nEPRI in May estimated data centers could consume 9% of the United States\u2019 electricity generation by 2030 \u2014 double the amount consumed today.\nHuang also expressed support for a recent deal between Constellation Energy and Microsoft to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, saying that the world will need all available sources of energy.\n\u201cNo one energy source will be sufficient for the world,\u201d he said.\nBut instead of trying to build new transmission to move electricity to areas of higher demand, Huang said the U.S should focus on building data centers in areas where energy is already abundant. AI could even be thought of as a form of energy storage, he said.\n\u201cInstead of transporting the energy to where we need it, let's transport the data center to where there is an energy source,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can build a data center anywhere. The computer doesn't care where it's going to school.\u201d\n\n\nRecommended Reading\n\n\n\n                        US data center electricity demand could double by 2030, driven by artificial intelligence: EPRI\n                    \n\nBy\n        \n            \n            \n                Robert Walton\n            \n        \n        \u2022\n    \nMay 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nLoad Management, Efficiency & Demand Response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Newsletter:\n\n\nDaily Dive\nM-F\n\n\n\nSelect Newsletter:\n\n\nStorage Weekly\nEvery Tuesday\n\n\n\nSelect Newsletter:\n\n\nLoad Management Weekly\nEvery Wednesday\n\n\n\nSelect Newsletter:\n\n\nRenewable Energy Weekly\nEvery Thursday\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

They can\u2019t repeat that mistake with AIFri 13 Sep 2024 11.00 BSTLast modified on Fri 13 Sep 2024 16.01 BSTShareWhen a company triples in value in just a few months, as computer chip company Nvidia has, investors take notice. But regulators do too, because they know from experience how monopolies engage in illegal anti-competitive behavior that squashes competitors and manipulates the market to expand their dominance. The US Department of Justice (as well as other competition authorities and tech observers) suspects Nvidia has used such tactics to entrench its chips monopoly, and last month it was reported that the Department of Justice was opening an antitrust investigation. It\u2019s high time.Before the pandemic, few beyond video game enthusiasts \u2013 whose top-of-the-line gaming computers and consoles are built on high-capacity Nvidia chips \u2013 had ever heard of the company. But thanks to the generative AI boom, Nvidia has become one of the fastest-growing companies ever, and its chips have powered every important AI milestone \u2013 including OpenAI\u2019s development of ChatGPT, which holds two-thirds of the AI business tools market.Because the immense calculations that underpin generative AI require tens if not hundreds of thousands of extremely powerful chips in enormous data centers \u2013 calculations that Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs) excel in \u2013 the company\u2019s market capitalization has shot up by more than 30 times in just five years, briefly making it the world\u2019s most valuable company earlier this summer, eclipsing Microsoft and Apple.This is all terrific for Nvidia investors riding the AI wave, although recent stock market volatility suggests the euphoria may be overblown. Nvidia should not be stigmatized for making the most of being in the right place at the right time, but it matters how a company like Nvidia grows. If a company is using unfair practices to push competitors out of the way, jack up prices and deepen the moat around its monopoly, that\u2019s not good for its customers, for fair competition, or for the wider public.Like other tech giants, Nvidia is laser-focused on dominating every market it enters. It sells 88% of the world\u2019s GPUs, and has elbowed its way to domination in AI, too, which according to some estimates will be a trillion-dollar market within just a few years. Some analysts estimate that Nvidia already controls 98% of the market for data center GPUs.But like the rest of big tech, albeit with less scrutiny, Nvidia has risen to the top by exploiting its market dominance to lock in customers and marginalize competitors. It bundles everything its customers need (chips, software, and networking services) as a package, and prohibits those companies from doing business with its competitors. Similar tactics, including bundling, tying and self-preferencing, have already led to ongoing and unresolved antitrust actions in multiple jurisdictions against the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Google, and Nvidia could be next; the company is already facing antitrust scrutiny in France, the European Union and the UK.From boom to burst, the AI bubble is only heading in one direction | John NaughtonRead moreWith its control over a limited supply of in-demand chips, Nvidia has become the gatekeeper of progress. It gets to decide whose AI development can proceed (mostly the tech giants), and who gets starved (smaller competitors). Huge deals with companies like Meta, which buy tens or even hundreds of thousands of chips at a time, are sidelining independent entrepreneurs and researchers that simply can\u2019t compete. And even in serving smaller customers, Nvidia favors the companies it has a stake in.Everyone benefits from healthy competition in AI chips. Fair access to advanced semiconductors will help ensure that the potential benefits from AI are widely shared, not restricted to a narrow elite. It will give smaller and nimbler companies a fair chance, ensuring that AI innovation doesn\u2019t take place on big tech\u2019s terms. And it will increase choice and lower costs for businesses, resulting in more affordable products and services for consumers. And by reducing our dependence on one all-powerful producer, it will strengthen our resilience to supply chain disruption and technological failures, such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the recent CrowdStrike/Microsoft IT outage.And there\u2019s another reason to be wary of a hyper-concentrated chip market: AI regulation, be it the EU\u2019s AI Act or the White House executive order on AI, is emerging slowly, putting Nvidia \u2013 which gets to decide who gets chips for what \u2013 in a quasi-regulatory role. That\u2019s not the way things should work; regulatory policy is a public function, and a for-profit company should not be allowed, through its sheer size, to fill the vacuum. But Nvidia likes it this way, and has stepped up lobbying to try to maintain its de facto control of global AI.Nvidia\u2019s dramatic rise has taken many by surprise. But while it may be big tech\u2019s \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d, that doesn\u2019t mean it should get a free pass from regulators to abuse its monopoly power. By engaging in practices that lock in customers and keep out competitors, Nvidia is trying to rig the AI market in a way that furthers its interests while undermining the public interest. Competition authorities around the world were too slow to stop today\u2019s tech giants from dominating Web 2.0. They can\u2019t afford to repeat the same mistake with Nvidia and AI.\n\nMax von Thun is the director of Europe and transatlantic partnerships at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly thinktank\nExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionNvidiaArtificial intelligence (AI)Law (US)ComputingWeb 2.0commentShareReuse this contentComments (\u2026)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsCartoonsOpinion videosLettersNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It allows several organizations to collaborate on the development of an AI model without sensitive data ever leaving their servers.\n\u201cDue to privacy and data management constraints, it\u2019s growing more and more complicated to share data from site to site and aggregate it in one place \u2014 and imaging AI is developing faster than research institutes can set up data-sharing contracts,\u201d said John Garrett, associate professor of radiology at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cAdopting federated learning to build and test models at multiple sites at once is the only way, practically speaking, to keep up. It\u2019s an indispensable tool.\u201d\nGarrett is part of the Society for Imaging Informatics and Medicine (SIIM) Machine Learning Tools and Research Subcommittee, a group of clinicians, researchers and engineers that aims to advance the development and application of AI for medical imaging. NVIDIA is a member of SIIM, and has been collaborating with the committee on federated learning projects since 2019.\n\u201cFederated learning techniques allow enhanced data privacy and security in compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA and others,\u201d said committee chair Khaled Younis. \u201cIn addition, we see improved model accuracy and generalization.\u201d\nTo support their latest project, the team \u2014 including collaborators from Case Western, Georgetown University, the Mayo Clinic, the University of California, San Diego, the University of Florida and Vanderbilt University \u2014 tapped NVIDIA FLARE (NVFlare), an open-source framework that includes robust security features, advanced privacy protection techniques and a flexible system architecture.\nThrough the NVIDIA Academic Grant Program, the committee received four NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPUs, which were distributed across participating research institutes to set up their workstations for federated learning. Additional collaborators used NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud and in on-premises servers, highlighting the flexibility of NVFLare.\nCracking the Code for Federated Learning\nEach of six participating medical centers provided data from around 50 medical imaging studies for the project, focused on renal cell carcinoma, a kind of kidney cancer.\n\u201cThe idea with federated learning is that during training we exchange the model rather than exchange the data,\u201d said Yuankai Huo, assistant professor of computer science and director of the Biomedical Data Representation and Learning Lab at Vanderbilt University.\nIn a federated learning framework, an initial global model broadcasts model parameters to client servers. Each server uses those parameters to set up a local version of the model that\u2019s trained on the organization\u2019s proprietary data. Then, updated parameters from each of the local models are sent back to the global model, where they\u2019re aggregated to produce a new global model. The cycle repeats until the model\u2019s predictions no longer improve with each training round.\nThe group experimented with model architectures and hyperparameters to optimize for training speed, accuracy and the number of imaging studies required to train the model to the desired level of precision.\nAI-Assisted Annotation With NVIDIA MONAI\u00a0\nIn the first phase of the project, the training data used for the model was labeled manually. For the next phase, the team is using NVIDIA MONAI for AI-assisted annotation to evaluate how model performance differs with training data segmented with the help of AI compared to traditional annotation methods.\n\u201cThe biggest struggle with federated learning activities is typically that the data at different sites is not tremendously uniform. People use different imaging equipment, have different protocols and just label their data differently,\u201d said Garrett. \u201cBy training the federated learning model a second time with the addition of MONAI, we aim to find if that improves overall annotation accuracy.\u201d\nThe team is using MONAI Label, an image-labeling tool that enables users to develop custom AI annotation apps, reducing the time and effort needed to create new datasets. Experts will validate and refine the AI-generated segmentations before they\u2019re used for model training.\nData for both the manual and AI-assisted annotation phases is hosted on Flywheel, a leading medical imaging data and AI platform that has integrated NVIDIA MONAI into its offerings.\nOnce the project is complete, the team plans to publish their methodology, annotated datasets and pretrained model to support future work.\n\u201cWe\u2019re interested in not just exploring these tools,\u201d Garrett said, \u201cbut also publishing our work so others can learn and use these tools throughout the medical field.\u201d\nApply for an NVIDIA Academic Grant\nThe NVIDIA Academic Grant Program advances academic research by providing world-class computing access and resources to researchers.

These expectations for seamless, personalized experiences extend across digital communication channels, including live chat, text and social media.\nDespite the rise of digital channels, many consumers still prefer picking up the phone for support, placing strain on call centers. As companies strive to enhance the quality of customer interactions, operational efficiency and costs remain a significant concern.\nTo address these challenges, businesses are deploying AI-powered customer service software to boost agent productivity, automate customer interactions and harvest insights to optimize operations.\nIn nearly every industry, AI systems can help improve service delivery and customer satisfaction. Retailers are using conversational AI to help manage omnichannel customer requests, telecommunications providers are enhancing network troubleshooting, financial institutions are automating routine banking tasks, and healthcare facilities are expanding their capacity for patient care.\nWhat Are the Benefits of AI for Customer Service?\nWith strategic deployment of AI, enterprises can transform customer interactions through intuitive problem-solving to build greater operational efficiencies and elevate customer satisfaction.\nBy harnessing customer data from support interactions, documented FAQs and other enterprise resources, businesses can develop AI tools that tap into their organization\u2019s unique collective knowledge and experiences to deliver personalized service, product recommendations and proactive support.\nCustomizable, open-source generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), combined with natural language processing (NLP) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), are helping industries accelerate the rollout of use-case-specific customer service AI. According to McKinsey, over 80% of customer care executives are already investing in AI or planning to do so soon.\nWith cost-efficient, customized AI solutions, businesses are automating management of help-desk support tickets, creating more effective self-service tools and supporting their customer service agents with AI assistants. This can significantly reduce operational costs and improve the customer experience.\nDeveloping Effective Customer Service AI\nFor satisfactory, real-time interactions, AI-powered customer service software must return accurate, fast and relevant responses. Some\u00a0 tricks of the trade include:\nOpen-source foundation models can fast-track AI development. Developers can flexibly adapt and enhance these pretrained machine learning models, and enterprises can use them to launch AI projects without the high costs of building models from scratch.\nRAG frameworks connect foundation or general-purpose LLMs to proprietary knowledge bases and data sources, including inventory management and customer relationship management systems and customer service protocols. Integrating RAG into conversational chatbots, AI assistants and copilots tailors responses to the context of customer queries.\nHuman-in-the-loop processes remain crucial to both AI training and live deployments. After initial training of foundation models or LLMs, human reviewers should judge the AI\u2019s responses and provide corrective feedback. This helps to guard against issues such as hallucination \u2014\u00a0 where the model generates false or misleading information, and other errors including toxicity or off-topic responses. This type of human involvement ensures fairness, accuracy and security is fully considered during AI development.\nHuman participation is even more important for AI in production. When an AI is unable to adequately resolve a customer question, the program must be able to route the call to customer support teams. This collaborative approach between AI and human agents ensures that customer engagement is efficient and empathetic.\nWhat\u2019s the ROI of Customer Service AI?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe return on investment of customer service AI should be measured primarily based on efficiency gains and cost reductions. To quantify ROI, businesses can measure key indicators such as reduced response times, decreased operational costs of contact centers, improved customer satisfaction scores and revenue growth resulting from AI-enhanced services.\nFor instance, the cost of implementing an AI chatbot using open-source models can be compared with the expenses incurred by routing customer inquiries through traditional call centers. Establishing this baseline helps assess the financial impact of AI deployments on customer service operations.\nTo solidify understanding of ROI before scaling AI deployments, companies can consider a pilot period. For example, by redirecting 20% of call center traffic to AI solutions for one or two quarters and closely monitoring the outcomes, businesses can obtain concrete data on performance improvements and cost savings. This approach helps prove ROI and informs decisions for further investment.\nBusinesses across industries are using AI for customer service and measuring their success:\nRetailers Reduce Call Center Load\u00a0\nModern shoppers expect smooth, personalized and efficient shopping experiences, whether in store or on an e-commerce site. Customers of all generations continue prioritizing live human support, while also desiring the option to use different channels. But complex customer issues coming from a diverse customer base can make it difficult for support agents to quickly comprehend and resolve incoming requests.\nTo address these challenges, many retailers are turning to conversational AI and AI-based call routing. According to NVIDIA\u2019s 2024 State of AI in Retail and CPG report, nearly 70% of retailers believe that AI has already boosted their annual revenue.\nCP All, Thailand\u2019s sole licensed operator for 7-Eleven convenience stores, has implemented conversational AI chatbots in its call centers, which rack up more than 250,000 calls per day. Training the bots presented unique challenges due to the complexities of the Thai language, which includes 21 consonants, 18 pure vowels, three diphthongs and five tones.\nTo manage this, CP All used NVIDIA NeMo, a framework designed for building, training and fine-tuning GPU-accelerated speech and natural language understanding models. With automatic speech recognition and NLP models powered by NVIDIA technologies, CP All\u2019s chatbot achieved a 97% accuracy rate in understanding spoken Thai.\nWith the conversational chatbot handling a significant number of customer conversations, the call load on human agents was reduced by 60%. This allowed customer service teams to focus on more complex tasks. The chatbot also helped reduce wait times and provided quicker, more accurate responses, leading to higher customer satisfaction levels.\nWith AI-powered support experiences, retailers can enhance customer retention, strengthen brand loyalty and boost sales.\nTelecommunications Providers Automate Network Troubleshooting\nTelecommunications providers are challenged to address complex network issues while adhering to service-level agreements with end customers for network uptime. Maintaining network performance requires rapid troubleshooting of network devices, pinpointing root causes and resolving difficulties at network operations centers.\nWith its abilities to analyze vast amounts of data, troubleshoot network problems autonomously and execute numerous tasks simultaneously, generative AI is ideal for network operations centers. According to an IDC survey, 73% of global telcos have prioritized AI and machine learning investments for operational support as their top transformation initiative, underscoring the industry\u2019s shift toward AI and advanced technologies.\nInfosys, a leader in next-generation digital services and consulting, has built AI-driven solutions to help its telco partners overcome customer service challenges. Using NVIDIA NIM microservices and RAG, Infosys developed an AI chatbot to support network troubleshooting.\nBy offering quick access to essential, vendor-agnostic router commands for diagnostics and monitoring, the generative AI-powered chatbot significantly reduces network resolution times, enhancing overall customer support experiences.\nTo ensure accuracy and contextual responses, Infosys trained the generative AI solution on telecom device-specific manuals, training documents and troubleshooting guides. Using NVIDIA NeMo Retriever to query enterprise data, Infosys achieved 90% accuracy for its LLM output. By fine-tuning and deploying models with NVIDIA technologies, Infosys achieved a latency of 0.9 seconds, a 61% reduction compared with its baseline model. The RAG-enabled chatbot powered by NeMo Retriever also attained 92% accuracy, compared with the baseline model\u2019s 85%.\nWith AI tools supporting network administrators, IT teams and customer service agents, telecom providers can more efficiently identify and resolve network issues.\nFinancial Services Institutions Pinpoint Fraud With Ease\nWhile customers expect anytime, anywhere banking and support, financial services require a heightened level of data sensitivity. And unlike other industries that may include one-off purchases, banking is typically based on ongoing transactions and long-term customer relationships.\nAt the same time, user loyalty can be fleeting, with up to 80% of banking customers willing to switch institutions for a better experience. Financial institutions must continuously improve their support experiences and update their analyses of customer needs and preferences.\nMany banks are turning to AI virtual assistants that can interact directly with customers to manage inquiries, execute transactions and escalate complex issues to human customer support agents. According to NVIDIA\u2019s 2024 State of AI in Financial Services report, more than one-fourth of survey respondents are using AI to enhance customer experiences, and 34% are exploring the use of generative AI and LLMs for customer experience and engagement.\nBunq, a European digital bank with more than 2 million customers and 8 billion euros worth of deposits, is deploying generative AI to meet user needs. With proprietary LLMs, the company built Finn, a personal AI assistant available to both customers and bank employees. Finn can answer finance-related inquiries such as \u201cHow much did I spend on groceries last month?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the name of the Indian restaurant I ate at last week?\u201d\nPlus, with a human-in-the-loop process, Finn helps employees more quickly identify fraud. By collecting and analyzing data for compliance officers to review, bunq now identifies fraud in just three to seven minutes, down from 30 minutes without Finn.\nBy deploying AI tools that can use data to protect customer transactions, execute banking requests and act on customer feedback, financial institutions can serve customers at a higher level, building the trust and satisfaction necessary for long-term relationships.\nHealthcare and Life Sciences Organizations Overcome Staffing Shortages\nIn healthcare, patients need quick access to medical expertise, precise and tailored treatment options, and empathetic interactions with healthcare professionals. But with the World Health Organization estimating a 10 million personnel shortage by 2030, access to quality care could be jeopardized.\nAI-powered digital healthcare assistants are helping medical institutions do more with less. With LLMs trained on specialized medical corpuses, AI copilots can save physicians and nurses hours of daily work by helping with clinical note-taking, automating order-placing for prescriptions and lab tests, and following up with after-visit patient notes.\nMultimodal AI that combines language and vision models can make healthcare settings safer by extracting insights and providing summaries of image data for patient monitoring. For example, such technology can alert staff of patient fall risks and other patient room hazards.\nTo support healthcare professionals, Hippocratic AI has trained a generative AI healthcare agent to perform low-risk, non-diagnostic routine tasks, like reminding patients of necessary appointment prep and following up after visits to make sure medication routines are being followed and no adverse side effects are being experienced.\nHippocratic AI trained its models on evidence-based medicine and completed rigorous testing with a large group of certified nurses and doctors. The constellation architecture of the solution comprises 20 models, one of which communicates with patients while the other 19 supervise its output. The complete system contains 1.7 trillion parameters.\nThe possibility of every doctor and patient having their own AI-powered digital healthcare assistant means reduced clinician burnout and higher-quality medical care.\nRaising the Bar for Customer Experiences With AI\u00a0\nBy integrating AI into customer service interactions, businesses can offer more personalized, efficient and prompt service, setting new standards for omnichannel support experiences across platforms. With AI virtual assistants that process vast amounts of data in seconds, enterprises can equip their support agents to deliver tailored responses to the complex needs of a diverse customer base.\nTo develop and deploy effective customer service AI, businesses can fine-tune AI models and deploy RAG solutions to meet diverse and specific needs.\nNVIDIA offers a suite of tools and technologies to help enterprises get started with customer service AI.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, accelerate generative AI deployment and support various optimized AI models for seamless, scalable inference. NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints provide developers with packaged reference examples to build innovative solutions for customer service applications.\nBy taking advantage of AI development tools, enterprises can build accurate and high-speed AI applications to transform employee and customer experiences.\nLearn more about improving customer service with generative AI.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So the two started Deltia.ai, which runs NVIDIA Metropolis vision AI on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin modules to measure and help optimize assembly line processes.\nHailing from AI backgrounds, Homoceanu had previously led self-driving software at Volkswagen, while Fischer had founded a startup that helped digitize more than 40 factories.\nDeltia, an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, estimates that today its software platform can provide as much as a 20% performance jump on production lines for its customers.\nCustomers using the Deltia platform include Viessman, a maker of heating pumps, and industrial electronics company ABB, among others. Viessman is running Deltia at 15 stations, and plans to add it to even more lines in the future. Once all lines are linked to Deltia, production managers say that they expect up to a 50% increase in overall productivity.\n\u201cWe provide our users with a dashboard that is basically the Google Analytics of manufacturing,\u201d said Homoceanu, Deltia\u2019s CTO. \u201cWe install these sensors, and two weeks later they get the keys to this dashboard, and the magic happens in the background.\u201d\nCapturing Assembly Line Insights for Digital Transformations\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce the cameras start gathering data on assembly lines, Deltia uses that information to train models on NVIDIA-accelerated computing that can monitor activities on the line. It then uses those models deployed on Jetson AGX Orin modules at the edge to gather operational insights.\nThese Jetson-based systems continuously monitor the camera streams and extract metadata. This metadata identifies the exact points in time when a product arrives at a specific station, when it is being worked on and when it leaves the station. This digital information is available to line managers and process improvement personnel via Deltia\u2019s custom dashboard, helping to identify bottlenecks and accelerate line output.\n\u201cTensorRT helps us compress complex AI models to a level where we can serve, in an economical fashion, multiple stations with a single Jetson device,\u201d said Homoceanu.\nTapping Into Jetson Orin for Edge AI-Based Customer Insights\u00a0\nBeyond identifying quick optimizations, Deltia\u2019s analytics help visualize production flows hour-by-hour. This means that Deltia can send rapid alerts when production slips away from predicted target ranges, and it can continuously track output, cycle times and other critical key performance indicators.\nIt also helps map how processes flow throughout a factory floor, and it suggests improvements for things like walking routes and shop-floor layouts. One of Deltia\u2019s customers used the platform to identify that materials shelves were too far from workers, which caused unnecessarily long cycle times and limited production. Once the shelves were moved, production went up more than 30%.\nDeltia\u2019s applications extend beyond process improvements. The platform can be used to help monitor machine states at a granular level, assisting to predict when machine parts are worn out and recommend preemptive replacements, saving time and money down the line. The platform can also suggest optimizations for energy usage, saving on operational costs and reducing maintenance expenses.\n\u201cOur vision is to empower manufacturers with the tools to achieve unprecedented efficiency,\u201d said Fischer, CEO of Deltia.ai. \u201cSeeing our customers experience as much as a 30% increase in productivity with our vision models running on NVIDIA Jetson Orin validates the transformative potential of our technology.\u201d\nDeltia is a member of the NVIDIA Inception\u00a0program for cutting-edge startups.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Metropolis and NVIDIA Jetson.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated AnalyticsTags: Inception | Metropolis | NVIDIA Jetson \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They now accelerate more than 600 AI-enabled games and applications, with more than 100 million GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs in users\u2019 hands worldwide.\n\nSince the launch of NVIDIA DLSS \u2014 the first widely deployed PC AI technology \u2014 more than five years ago, on-device AI has expanded beyond gaming to livestreaming, content creation, software development, productivity and STEM use cases.\nAccelerating AI\u00a0\nAI boils down to massive matrix multiplication \u2014 in other words, incredibly complex math. CPUs can do math, but, as serial processors, they can only perform one operation per CPU core at a time. This makes them far too slow for practical use with AI.\nGPUs, on the other hand, are parallel processors, performing multiple operations at once. With hundreds of Tensor Cores each and being optimized for AI, RTX GPUs can accelerate incredibly complex mathematical operations.\nRTX-powered systems give users a powerful GPU accelerator for demanding AI workloads in gaming, content creation, software development and STEM subjects. Some also include an NPU, a lightweight accelerator for offloading select low-power workloads.\nLocal accelerators make AI capabilities always available (even without an internet connection), offer low latency for high responsiveness and increase privacy so that users don\u2019t have to upload sensitive materials to an online database before they become usable by an AI model.\nAdvanced Processing Power\nNVIDIA powers much of the world\u2019s AI \u2014 from data center to the edge to an install base of over 100 million PCs worldwide.\nThe GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs found in laptops, desktops and workstations share the same architecture as cloud servers and provide up to 686 AI trillion operations operations per second (TOPS) across the GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPU lineup.\nRTX GPUs unlock top-tier performance and power a wider range of AI and generative AI than systems with just an integrated system-on-a-chip (SoC).\n\u201cMany projects, especially within Windows, are built for and expect to run on NVIDIA cards. In addition to the wide software support base, NVIDIA GPUs also have an advantage in terms of raw performance.\u201d \u2014 Jon Allman, industry analyst at Puget Systems\nGamers can use DLSS for AI-enhanced performance and can look forward to NVIDIA ACE digital human technology for next-generation in-game experiences. Creators can use AI-accelerated video and photo editing tools, asset generators, AI denoisers and more. Everyday users can tap RTX Video Super Resolution and RTX Video HDR for improved video quality, and NVIDIA ChatRTX and NVIDIA Broadcast for productivity improvements. And developers can use RTX-powered coding and debugging tools, as well as the NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit to build and deploy AI-enabled apps for RTX.\nLarge language models \u2014 like Google\u2019s Gemma, Meta\u2019s Llama and Microsoft\u2019s Phi \u2014 all run faster on RTX AI PCs, as systems with GPUs load LLMs into VRAM. Add in NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM acceleration and RTX GPUs can run LLMs 10-100x faster than on CPUs.\nNew RTX AI PCs Available Now\nNew systems from ASUS and MSI are now shipping with up to GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPUs \u2014 delivering up to 321 AI TOPS of performance \u2014 and power-efficient SoCs with Windows 11 AI PC capabilities. Windows 11 AI PCs will receive a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available.\n\nASUS\u2019 Zephyrus G16 comes with up to a GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU to supercharge photo and video editing, image generation and coding, while game-enhancing features like DLSS create additional high-quality frames and improve image quality. The 321 TOPS of local AI processing power available from the GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU enables multiple AI applications to run simultaneously, changing the way gamers, creators and engineers work and play.\n\nThe ASUS ProArt P16 is the first AI PC built for advanced AI workflows across creativity, gaming, productivity and more. Its GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU provides creatives with RTX AI acceleration in top 2D, 3D, video editing and streaming apps. The ASUS ProArt P13 also comes with state-of-the-art graphics and an OLED touchscreen for ease of creation. Both laptops also come NVIDIA Studio-validated, enabling and accelerating your creativity.\n\nThe MSI Stealth A16 AI+ features the latest GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs, delivering up to 321 AI TOPS with a GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. This fast and intelligent AI-powered PC is designed to excel in gaming, creation and productivity, offering access to next-level technology.\nThese laptops join hundreds of RTX AI PCs available today from top manufacturers, with support for the 600+ AI applications and games accelerated by RTX.\nGenerative AI is transforming graphics and interactive experiences of all kinds.

Novation City also hosts organized activities to drive ecosystem growth, such as hackathons and specialized training sessions. It\u2019s all brought together in this new environment conducive to AI learning, experimentation and deployment.\n\u201cNovation City has launched several key AI initiatives to strengthen the ecosystem, with NVIDIA\u2019s support being instrumental in empowering AI startups and advancing AI skills,\u201d said Anas Rochdi, chief innovation officer at Novation City. \u201cThis year, we deployed Tunisia\u2019s first NVIDIA DGX system and launched major academic initiatives in collaboration with the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, aiming to train more than 1,000 developers in one year.\u201d\nNovation City also runs several startup accelerator programs, and more than 10 participating companies are members of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that nurtures cutting-edge startups.\nTunisia Drives Innovation in STEM and AI Education\nTunisia\u2019s education system has traditionally emphasized STEM, especially mathematics and the sciences, according to Wei Xiao, who leads NVIDIA\u2019s developer relations team for startups, enterprises and universities in the Middle East and Africa.\n\u201cTunisia has a rich history of valuing knowledge and scholarship, dating back to ancient Carthage and the Islamic Golden Age,\u201d Xiao said. \u201cAnd the nation\u2019s curriculum is rigorous, creating a solid foundation for advanced studies in STEM fields.\u201d\nThis has made the country \u2014 well-situated to serve as a gateway between Europe, Africa and the Middle East (EMEA) \u2014 a thriving ecosystem for innovation, entrepreneurship and research. Novation City and NVIDIA aim to bolster the ecosystem even further through the new AI innovation hub.\nFostering collaboration between academia, industry and government, the initiative is funded by French and German development agencies, the Tunisian government, the World Bank and the European Union, as well as several enterprises.\nAnd the hub comes at a time when Tunisia has adopted a national strategy for AI and digitalization \u2014 which includes promoting AI education and research \u2014 as part of a broader vision to position the nation as a digital leader in Africa. For example, the University of Tunis this month launched the nation\u2019s first public institute specializing in AI.\nPartners Foster Sovereign AI in Tunisia and Beyond\nA key part of sovereign AI is a nation\u2019s ability to produce artificial intelligence using its own workforce \u2014 along with its own infrastructure, data and business networks. Free DLI training offered through Tunisia\u2019s AI innovation hub is poised to enable just that, helping upskill the next generation of African AI experts.\nPlus, Novation City already offers a wide range of facilities designed to support technological and scientific advancement.\nIn February, Novation City deployed an NVIDIA DGX system, among the first in Africa, that has empowered about 30 startups across the continent in climate AI, transportation, manufacturing, agtech and other industries to develop accelerated computing-based solutions.\nIn addition, ESPRIT University \u2014 a specialized university in Tunisia with more than 10,000 engineering students \u2014 boasts nine NVIDIA DLI ambassadors who are delivering training to students and contributing to the broader tech ecosystem across the country. This makes ESPRIT University one of the most active DLI organizations across EMEA.\nSince 2018, ESPRIT has been tapping into DLI to advance AI education. The university has also acquired an NVIDIA DGX system to support research and product development.\nNVIDIA has planned similar AI education initiatives in Kenya and Nigeria to further upskill and enhance African technology ecosystems.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning Institute | Education | Smart Spaces | Social Impact | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"
