A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\r\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

Reported EPS is $5.16, expectations were $4.54. NVDA isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).   Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Rob and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference. Simona Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024. With me today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.   These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, February 21, 2024, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that let me turn the call over to Colette. Colette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency.   Story Continues   At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions.   The versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy. In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems.   These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-throughs rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation of large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world many regions.   And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. Just this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated computing platform. We estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. And in fact, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly.   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.   In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained Biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection.   For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4. And we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first-quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year.   NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet, that are purpose built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter. We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities.   Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating an everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large-language models generative AI can run up to 5X faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEMs. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14 inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed-base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.   Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize work flows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers often -- offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year.   There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and proviz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis-points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us.   GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community.

All rights reserved\nNvidia recently sparked a stock market rally with a strong earnings report, largely driven by AI demand. The big question: Are we seeing the peak of Nvidia's AI play or is there more room for the stock to run in 2024?\n\n\nLet's walk through the relevant details to answer that question, including the current state of AI stocks, key NVDA metrics and longer-term expectations for the company.\n\nThe State Of AI Stocks\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a hot investing topic in 2024, but it's not a new concept. Nearly three decades ago, an AI-powered supercomputer by IBM\nIBM\n (IBM) beat chess master Garry Kasparov in a six-game chess match. That was an AI turning point. In the years since, hardware makers have made serious advancements in processing power, enabling increasingly powerful machine learning applications.\n\nIn 2022, ChatGPT emerged as the face of generative artificial intelligence\u2013AI that can create original text, media and code. Google\nGOOG\n followed with the release of Bard (now called Gemini) and Microsoft\nMSFT\n came out with Copilot. Through that rush of AI chatbot launches, the AI segment of tech became widely recognized as an emerging investment opportunity.\n\nThe opportunity in AI goes well beyond chatbots that can write essays and create videos. Enterprise organizations are increasingly exploring the use of AI for cost efficiency, data-driven decision-making, automation of repetitive tasks and product and service improvements. Those applications require specialized hardware and software, such as high-powered processors, memory chips, solid-state drives and robust AI development platforms.\nTo date, the input focus has been on GPUs (graphics processing units). In that realm, Nvidia is the clear leader. The chip designer owns an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. Other players in this space include Advanced Micro Devices\nAMD\n and Intel\nINTC\n .\n\nOutside of chip design, other tech stocks to watch include chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), memory and storage provider Micron Technology\nMU\n and cloud computing providers Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon\nAMZN\n , Microsoft and IBM.\nThe table below shows how these stocks have performed year to date and over the last three years, alongside the S&P 500 growth in the same periods.Table data source: Yahoo Finance\nAs you can see, NVDA is the growth leader, followed by Microsoft and Alphabet.\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download one of Forbes' most popular and widely anticipated reports, 12 Best Stocks To Buy for 2024.\nIs AI Still A Good Investment?\nInvestors today may have missed Nvidia's early AI gains, but the broader AI segment continues to be an interesting investment opportunity. That will be the case as long as enterprise adoption of AI tech remains strong. For context, an iShares survey concludes that 70% of business executives will increase their AI spending in 2024.\nSixty percent of respondents from the iShares survey cited cost savings as their primary goal for AI. As businesses realize AI-related cost savings, competitors will likely follow suit. That, in turn, should fuel ongoing demand for the hardware and software inputs that enable AI development.\nSo, yes, a diversified position in AI is still a good investment. Diversification is important because the beneficiaries of growing AI adoption will expand beyond Nvidia and its fellow chip designers. There could be valuable opportunities, for example, in small- and mid-cap stocks that deliver lower-cost AI solutions suitable for smaller businesses.\nNVDA Stock Key Metrics\nNvidia released its fourth quarter, 2024 earnings on February 21. Among the highlights were record revenue for the quarter and the year, plus record quarterly revenue for the Data Center division. The Data Center division includes Nvidia's AI business. Here are the specifics:\n\nFiscal Year (FY) 2024 diluted, adjusted EPS: $12.96 vs. $3.34 in the prior year\nFY 2024 GAAP diluted EPS: $11.93\nFY 2024 diluted, adjusted EPS growth: 288%\nFY 2024 revenue: $60.9 billion vs. $26.9 billion in the prior year\nFY 2024 revenue growth: 126%\nFY 2024 data center revenue growth: 217%\nFirst quarter, 2024 revenue outlook: $24 billion, plus or minus 2%\n\nKey NVDA stock metrics as of February 22 include:\n\nStock price: $785.27\nConsensus price target: $832.03\nMarket cap: $1.94 trillion\nP/E ratio: 65.8\nStock price growth YTD 2024: 58.6%\n\nStop chasing shadows in the market. Forbes' expert analysts have pinpointed the 12 superstars poised to ignite returns in 2024. Don't miss out\u2014download 12 Best Stocks To Buy For 2024 and claim your front-row seat to the coming boom.\nIs Nvidia Still A Top AI Stock?\nNvidia is still a top AI stock with a bright future. An important consideration for new investors, however, is the extent to which high growth expectations are already priced into the stock.\nNvidia's market capitalization passed the $1 trillion mark in May 2023. After reporting consensus-beating year-end results and a continued growth outlook for the next quarter, NVDA jumped 16% within 24 hours\u2014sparking a market rally in the process. The bump briefly pushed the company past the $2 trillion valuation mark.\nThat's a doubling of value in about nine months, which is unheard of for a company of that size. The same feat took two years for Apple\nAAPL\n and Microsoft.\nNVDA's current P/E ratio is 65.8. Despite the company's quick growth, that's only a bit higher than its five-year average P/E of 62.19, per Morningstar. In the table below, you can see how Nvidia's P/E compares to competitors in the AI space.Table data source: Yahoo Finance\nWith the exception of Micron Technology, none of these are undervalued stocks, and NVDA commands a premium relative to all of them.\nNo doubt, some premium is justified. Nvidia is central to the AI revolution, to the point of being almost immune to competition for now. Demand for AI chips should continue strong in the short-term, especially as corporate AI investments begin delivering quantifiable business improvements.\nStill, the stock's high price tag is a risk, as is buying a stock that's trending after a surprisingly positive earnings report. The reality is that Nvidia will have competitors eventually. Sales growth will slow from today's frenzied levels. And, the AI landscape will evolve and mature, which should create opportunities for other players. For those reasons, investors looking to capitalize on AI stocks today may want to look beyond Nvidia.\nThe Long-Term Outlook For Nvidia\nIn the immediate term, Nvidia expects to generate $24 billion in sales, plus or minus 2%, in the upcoming quarter. That equates to growth of 8.5% vs. the fourth quarter and 234% vs. the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nAnalysts largely expect the strong quarter-over-quarter growth to continue throughout the year. Comparisons will get tougher after the first quarter, but the consensus expectation is 73% sales growth for fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2026, analysts expect sales growth to slow to 21%.\nThe consensus EPS expectations for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are $23.92 and $29.26, respectively.\nLonger term, Nvidia is likely to remain at the forefront of computing even as competition ramps up in AI. The company has historically excelled at identifying trends early, innovating solutions and leveraging a first-mover advantage. Through that cycle, NVDA created GPU demand in the early 2000s and, now, practically owns the AI chip market. Outside of any big leadership or strategy changes, whatever's next for processors, Nvidia should be involved.\nBottom Line\nNvidia is a strong company with a clear advantage in AI. The stock's stronghold in an exciting growth market is driving a high price tag. That's great news for current Nvidia shareholders but it creates risk for investors who buy the stock today.\nRead Next\n\n3 Best Growth Stocks For 2024\n10 Best Stocks For 2024\n5 Best Blue-Chip Stocks For 2024\n\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024.

We also pulled past data on Nvidia (NVDA) earnings to provide some color to the upcoming earnings report on Feb. 21. View the full email here!What to expect from Nvidia earningsNVDA has been a key catalyst to the recent market highs, year to date it's up nearly 41% and over 230% over the last year. The semiconductor space has been on fire. For example, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), a semiconductor ETF, is up nearly 66% in the past year.The current implied volatility (IV) in NVDA represents the market pricing in a roughly +/- 11% move through the end of this week.A historical perspectiveWe looked at the past moves in NVDA to see where that stands.Quantifying these moves, we see that the standard deviation of the past moves has been +/- 8.6%\u2014which means current IV is pricing in greater price movement expectations. In other words, current implied volatility is priced much higher than the past\u2014meaning that options prices are inflated vs historical prices.It's not a shock that volatility has increased in many of the ETFs that hold NVDA\u2014including SMH which has a weighting to NVDA of just under 25%. If the current expected move of +/- $80 holds, we could see a 2% to 3% move in SMH.If the sector experiences a sympathy move\u2014meaning they move similarly to NVDA after earnings\u2014it wouldn't be shocking to see 3% to 5% on SMHFor more color, check out Mike Butler's NVDA Earnings Preview here!Bitcoin ETFs: Which is the most liquid?Over the last couple of weeks, volumes in the new bitcoin ETFs continued to increase. One big reason is the liquidation of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)\u2014a higher-fee trading vehicle compared to the new lower-fee products hitting the market. All else equal, moving out of GBTC saves 100 to 150 basis points in fees.As for liquidity, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has maintained the highest average volumes since launch. These ETF launches are a race for liquidity\u2014as the cost of maintaining these products is substantial. It wouldn't be a shock to see many of these ETFs discontinue in the coming years. For liquidity purposes it seems investors have chosen IBIT, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) as the market leaders.Sign up for the cherry picks report HERE!Nick Battista, tastylive director of market intelligence, has a decade of trading experience.

For the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. The numbers represent significant increases from last year's results in the same period. Earnings rose more than 486% while revenue was up more than 262%.  The company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter. Wall Street reacted with a slew of boosted price targets and overall bullish sentiment on the stock that rose double digits on Thursday following its earnings release. The median price target on the stock rose 19% following the report. Below is a collection of comments Wall Street is making about Nvidia after its fourth quarter earnings release. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.15 -2.38 (-1.99%)  As of 2:55:22 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs, Buy rating, price target $875 (from $800)  \"Nvidia delivered against what was seemingly a very high bar with Data Center once again serving as the key growth driver. Looking ahead, despite the [greater than three times year-over-year] increase in Data Center revenue in FY2024, we model another [greater than two times year-over-year] increase in FY2025 as we expect not only sustained growth in Gen AI infrastructure spending by the large [communication service providers] and consumer internet companies, but also increased development and adoption of AI across enterprise customers representing various industry verticals and, increasingly, sovereign states.\"  Vedvati Shrotre, Jefferies, Buy rating, price target $780 (from $610) \"We've observed that computing eras are typically dominated by a single ecosystem that is provided by a single, vertically integrated chip+hardware+software company, like IBM in mainframes and Apple in smartphones. NVDA's strong commentary regarding use for GPUs for inference and training workloads foots with our field checks that NVDA has become the AI ecosystem of choice. We think many investors continue to underestimate the amount of investment NVDA has poured into its ecosystem, and the lead that has given the company in the market, which has translated to a virtuous circle of software developers and platform suppliers embracing NVDA as the ecosystem of choice for AI workloads.\" Vivek Arya, Bank of America, Buy rating, price target $925 (from $800) \"Perhaps the most important new datapoint in NVDA's earnings call was that AI inference contributed nearly 40% of AI computing mix in FY24/CY23. AI inference is correlated with revenue bearing AI which is supposed to be more competitive, as opposed to AI training which NVDA already dominates. Second, we highlight the company's positive commentary around tight supply, low China dependence (only mid-single digit percent of data center sales versus 20%-25% prior to restrictions), new pipeline, rising sovereign demand for AI among others.\"   Story Continues Timothy Arcuri, UBS Investment Bank, Buy rating, price target $800 (from $800)\"There were a few items that could maybe suggest some slowing revenue growth on the horizon (mostly supply and opex) but we will have to see how these evolve. The bottom line is that we are still in such early stages of what is possible with AI (especially health care/drug discovery) and NVDA is the de-facto global AI platform, it seems too soon to take a more cautious view. We are trimming estimates a bit to reflect some potential slowing in revenue growth and price target goes from $850 to $800 but we maintain our Buy.\" Harlan Sur, JPMorgan, Overweight rating, price target $850 (from $650)\"The [Nividia] team noted that demand will continue to outstrip supply through CY24, allaying fears of an inventory build/correction in the 2H of the year. The team feels constructive on the sustained growth into CY25+ driven by transition to accelerated computing, proliferation of generative AI applications, and build-out of sovereign AI.\"The team provided examples of the strong AI monetization from their customers ( e.g. ServiceNow drove their largest ever net-new annual contract value contribution, Microsoft 365 Copilot grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite).\"Atif Malik, Citi analyst, Buy rating, price target $820\"Nvidia expects AI demand to remain strong and above supply through the year. China was down sharply due to US restrictions ... Inference sales were 40% of data center sales last year and the company expects data center infrastructure installed base of $1T to double over the next five years. While [year-over-year] data center comps could pose a headwind for the stock, long-term earnings power looks attractive based on our $200B compute TAM by 2027.\" Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson, Neutral rating, price target $620\"While FY2025 will be a terrific year for NVIDIA, we believe that FY2026 and beyond may not see continued growth. Messaging from the four largest customers suggests that they're accelerating spend this year to meet current demand but are characterizing their purchasing as demand-driven, implying the possibility of scaling down compute spend once we approach the trough of disillusionment. We believe that customers like Microsoft are not interested in indefinitely sustaining this level of Capex dedicated solely to AI compute, yet alone NVIDIA. Consequently, we believe our FY26 and FY27 estimates reflect a Street low, as we see potential for a sequential decline in NVIDIA's data center business starting sometime over the next 4-6 quarters. We are raising our target to $620 from $410 to reflect a higher cyclical peek this year than we previously estimated.\"Ruben Roy, Stifel, Buy rating, price target $910 (from $865)\"As questions regarding the sustainability of NVDA's growth increase, we found management commentary on revenue diversification notable. In addition to continued growth of Networking and Software NVDA's overall Data Center revenue is increasingly diversifying across industries and regions, including a growing contribution from demand related to sovereign AI deployments. This diversification, in our view, is likely to continue as AI-related [return on investment] for end users accelerates. NVDA continues to believe that the migration from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents a $1 trillion opportunity, longer-term ... We continue to expect NVDA to be the primary beneficiary of AI infrastructure deployments over the next several years. Despite supply improvements across NVDA\u2019s product set, management continues to see strong demand over the medium-term with expectations for demand to continue to outstrip supply of new products.\"Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital, Buy rating, price target $1,200 \"We believe NVDA could be looking at a $150B GPU opportunity in CY2024. A key difference in our view vs. Street (we believe) is our work regarding high-end Data Center GPUs where we see NVDA tracking towards 5.0M for CY2024/FY2025 and 6.5M+ for CY2025/FY2026. It is our belief that Street (through investor conversations) is positioned at 4.0M \u2013 4.5M TOTAL Enterprise & Data Center GPUs for CY2024 / FY2025.\"  The Nvidia logo is displayed on a mobile phone screen in front of a computer screen in Ankara, Turkey, on Nov, 23, 2023.

My hair is thinning. I don't wake up at 1:45 a.m. each day with the same fiery energy to obsess over markets and stocks. I am down to eating red meat three times a month \"just because\" it's what people have told me is the right thing to do at this point in life.  From what I can tell, one of the only positives of getting old is experience. And my experience in analyzing and reporting on markets and leaders for more than a decade tells me that investors have become fully engulfed in an AI-fueled tech bubble. To be fair, this feels like a much different bubble than the cannabis and crypto stock bubbles of years gone by, as tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) have real money-minting business models. Their leaders also aren't inexperienced dopes (see the cryptosphere's bad actors of the last two years). But make no mistake: We are in a bubble, and it could end badly at some point. Here are some of the elements I see to support this view.   Everything rallies, but should it? Nvidia shares ripped 15% higher last Thursday after earnings. The report sent the broader market ripping higher too. Nvidia rivals AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM) saw strong bids. New hot Yahoo Finance ticker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) exploded by 36%. Even Intel (INTC) caught some Nvidia tailwinds. And shares of Meta (META), which has been out in front in buying Nvidia chips, shot higher as well. Doesn't this all look insane and feel akin to blind buying by FOMO traders? In a normal functioning market, Nvidia doing amazingly is bad news for competitors such as AMD and Intel. Nvidia is selling more of its chips, meaning fewer sales opportunities for rivals. Shouldn't their stocks drop?  Just because Meta owns and uses some new Nvidia chips, how is that going to positively impact its earnings and cash flow over the next four quarters? Will it at all? The point is that investors are acting irrationally as Nvidia serves up eye-popping financial figures and the hype machine descends on social media. It makes sense until it doesn't, and that is classic bubble action. Justifying inflated valuations Still not convinced this is an AI-fueled tech bubble? Then cast your eyes on the typical Wall Street action of justifying ever-higher valuation multiples on stocks.   Story Continues   Tech price-to-earnings multiples are rich. Is this the making of an AI-fueled bubble?  \"At 29x our calendar year 2024 estimated [earnings per share], Nvidia trades at a lower multiple vs. peers Intel and AMD,\" one analyst wrote in a note following the Nvidia earnings stampede. \"We view the valuation as compelling. Nvidia remains a top pick.\"I am not saying Nvidia shouldn't be valued at a premium to the market \u2014 not saying that at all, so don't shred me via email.What I am asking you to do is to deconstruct the above commentary, which is creeping more and more into tech coverage.The analyst, in this case, has rationalized that 1) high price multiples for slower growers Intel and AMD are OK because AI is so hot, or so it seems, and 2) Nvidia's stock deserves to trade at about a 33% premium to an already rich P/E multiple on the S&P 500.Nvidia's valuation isn't mind-blowingly compelling considering earnings estimates have been jacked up to the ceiling! This is a priced-for-absolute-perfection tech stock.But hey, inside a tech bubble, anything goes, right? Thinking you can't be stoppedNothing says \"investing bubble\" like unbridled confidence. It's that feeling that whatever stock you buy \u2014 at whatever price and at whatever time \u2014 will only go up forever. This makes you feel like an investing genius and inclined to take on more risk.Here's a dose of insight that shows a ton of overconfidence sweeping through markets.Traders\u2019 confidence in their own decision making, consistent with bullishness, just hit the highest level since Charles Schwab began its Trader Sentiment survey, the financial services firm said this week. From a sector perspective, traders are most bullish on information technology (shocker). They are very upbeat on AI stocks in particular (shocker).News flash: You aren't an investing genius. The best thing you can do right now to grow your wealth is realize it's time to lay the groundwork to begin protecting your wealth that has been created by the tech bubble.Lean on your investing experience and all its wrinkles.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on what to look for in Nvidia\u2019s earnings and stock.\u00a0\nWhat to Watch for in Nvidia\u2019s Q4 Earnings\u00a0\nThe Data Centre Segment Remains in Focus\u00a0\nThis business dominates Nvidia\u2019s revenue, earnings, and valuation. The company has continued to smash through its prior guidance and lift its estimates for the coming quarter. We anticipate more of the same.\u00a0\nThe biggest factors putting a ceiling on Nvidia\u2019s earnings are supply constraints, and we\u2019ll be interested in any commentary about whether (or how rapidly) the firm\u2019s manufacturing partners are expanding to satisfy demand for its AI graphics processing units.\u00a0\nArtificial Intelligence Will be Top of Mind\u00a0\nWe see many moving pieces within the AI market for Nvidia and its peers. Some questions we have:\u00a0\nWhat impact have US restrictions on AI accelerator sales into China had? What progress has Nvidia made in ensuring its new products are compliant? In the meantime, will the restrictions make a dent in the firm\u2019s growth trajectory?\u00a0\nWhat is the demand from nation-states? It appears sovereign governments are buying Nvidia GPUs to build supercomputers. How much will this contribute to revenue growth?\u00a0\nWhat is the size of the AI accelerator market? Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\u00a0stunningly lifted its forecast for the 2027 industry total addressable market to $400 billion from $150 billion. This includes other types of chips besides GPUs but still implies massive GPU growth, and Nvidia still dominates the AI GPU space.\u00a0\nWhat capital expenditure is Nvidia seeing in the data centre? Mega-cap tech companies have lifted their spending plans for AI in 2024, and cloud leaders might buy many more GPUs than what the market anticipates over the next few years.\u00a0\nReuters recently reported that Nvidia is building a custom chip design unit that might help build specialized AI chips for others. We\u2019ll be interested in any insight around this initiative, and the opportunities it might open for Nvidia.\u00a0\nAll these items will help us inform our estimates for future data centre revenue growth, and in turn free cash flow generation and our fair value estimate.\u00a0\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $480.00\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating: 2 stars\u00a0 \u2022 Morningstar\u00a0Economic Moat Rating: Wide\u00a0 \u2022 Morningstar\u00a0Uncertainty Rating: Very High\u00a0\n\n\n\nFair Value Estimate for Nvidia\u00a0\nWith its 2-star rating, we believe Nvidia\u2019s stock is overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $480 per share, which implies an equity value of over $1.1 trillion, a fiscal 2024 price/adjusted earnings multiple of 45 times, and a fiscal 2025 forward price/adjusted earnings multiple of 31 times.\u00a0\nOur fair value estimate (and Nvidia\u2019s stock price) will be driven by its prospects in the data\u00a0centre\u00a0segment and AI GPUs, for better or worse. We\u00a0anticipate\u00a0a massive expansion in the AI processor market in the decade ahead, and we see room for tremendous revenue growth both at Nvidia and for competing solutions from either external chipmakers (like AMD or Intel (INTC) or in-house solutions developed by\u00a0hyperscalers\u00a0(such as chips from Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), or others).\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s data centre business has already achieved exponential growth, rising from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in fiscal 2023. The firm should see an even higher inflection point in fiscal 2024, as we expect data centre revenue to more than double to $41 billion.\u00a0We don\u2019t view this spike as coming from frontloaded orders or a buildup of excess capacity, as we model 46% growth in fiscal 2025 data centre revenue to over $60 billion. We model growth of 23%, 20%, and 13% in the following three years, driving the segment\u2019s revenue to $100 billion in fiscal 2028.\u00a0We doubt that any enterprise wants to be left behind, nor does any cloud computing provider want to be shorthanded when providing AI GPUs to customers.\u00a0\nNVDA Bulls Say\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs offer industry-leading parallel processing, which was historically needed in PC gaming applications but has expanded into crypto mining, AI, and perhaps other future applications.\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s data centre GPUs and Cuda software platform have established the company as the dominant vendor for AI model training, which is a use case that should rise exponentially in the years ahead.\u00a0\nThe firm has a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving market that could lead to widespread adoption of its Drive PX self-driving platform.\u00a0\nNVDA Bears Say\u00a0\nNvidia is a leading AI chip vendor today, but other powerful chipmakers and tech titans are focused on in-house chip development.\u00a0\nAlthough Cuda is preeminent in AI training software and tools, leading cloud vendors would likely prefer to see greater competition in this space and may shift to alternative open-source tools if they were to arise.\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s gaming GPU business has often seen boom-or-bust cycles based on PC demand, and more recently cryptocurrency mining as well.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the Latest Market Insights in Your Inbox\nSubscribe Here for Our Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nAI\nMAGNIFICENT SEVEN\nNVIDIA\nSEMICONDUCTORS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

But Nvidia Is Investing in 5 Other AI Stocks.      Jon Quast, The Motley Fool   February 19, 2024 5 min read        10   In This Article:  NVDA       RXRX         Over any meaningful time span, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a blockbuster investment. It's up almost 1,800% over the last five years, and it has more than tripled in the past year alone, fueled by investors' excitement for artificial intelligence (AI). There's good reason to believe Nvidia is a top AI stock. Management attributes its surging revenue to AI-related products and services. To illustrate how strong demand is, the company expects to report revenue of $20 billion in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. That would be a 231% year-over-year increase -- simply astounding for a company of this size.  AI is the top investment trend right now, and Nvidia stock is one of the most popular ways to ride the trend higher. However, for its part, the company is buying shares of five other AI companies. This interesting development made the news on Feb. 14 with Nvidia's first 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This form is for institutional investment managers to report their stock holdings. According to its 13F, Nvidia has a stock portfolio worth $230 million, and these are the AI stocks it's been buying. A glimpse inside Nvidia's stock portfolio Nvidia's 13F shows it owns only five stocks, but all five have a connection to AI in some capacity. Here's a quick overview of each company, from the largest investment down to the smallest. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) licenses its AI semiconductor chip designs to other companies, and this business is in high demand right now. Nvidia tried to acquire Arm back in 2020 but finally called it off in 2022 after pushback from regulators. Now, it will look to benefit as an investor. This is Nvidia's largest stock position, valued at $147 million as of the SEC filing. Next in Nvidia's portfolio is Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX). This early-stage biotechnology company is using AI models to process genetic data and find new drugs. It's an idea that could be game-changing for the medical field, which is why the stock has also caught the attention of growth investor Cathie Wood. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) offers an AI voice assistant that's similar to what's already offered by major tech companies. However, SoundHound AI believes its AI is more capable of understanding normal language. And based on its growing customer list, there seems to be support for management's claim. Of Nvidia's stocks, investors might want to disregard TuSimple Holdings, considering it's delisting from the Nasdaq. That said, this company has an AI angle as well -- it's working to enable autonomous driving for trucking companies. Finally, Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX) -- or just Nanox -- is Nvidia's smallest stock position. This company hopes to transition the world to a new digital X-ray technology. It intends to use AI to go through these digital images and find patterns that doctors might overlook, leading to better outcomes for patients.    Story Continues When it comes to AI stocks, I personally believe the trend, as a whole, is overhyped. And stock market history is littered with past trends that eventually fizzled out. Therefore, investors need to be discerning.That said, I believe AI can unlock a lot of possibilities when it comes to the medical field. This is why I'm particularly intrigued with Nvidia's investments in Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox.These two stocks are particularly high-risk and high-rewardFull disclaimer before I go any further: I am not a medical expert in the slightest. I'm just a regular investor on the outside looking in. Investing great Warren Buffett says to stay inside of your circle of competence. And fellow great Peter Lynch says to invest in what you know. Medical stocks aren't that for me.However, I do know enough to understand datasets are enormous in this field, and processing large amounts of data is where AI really shines.Consider one of Recursion Pharmaceutical's newest partnerships as an example. In the third quarter of 2023, it partnered with Tempus to gain access to 20 additional petabytes (over 20,000,000 gigabytes) of oncology data. It now has a staggering 50 petabytes at its disposal for cancer research. And to process this much information, the company will keep working with Nvidia to make its BioHive-1 supercomputer more powerful.Nanox only has a limited number of medical devices in operation right now. But when it went public in 2020, the company hoped to eventually deploy 15,000 machines, which would make more than 150 monthly digital scans each.Nanox is still a long way from that goal, and it may never get there. But hitting its goals would represent nearly 2.3 million medical images per month. This could quickly become the largest medical-imaging dataset in the world, and the company will need to use AI to make any sort of discovery.Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are looking to use AI to unlock important medical breakthroughs by using enormous medical datasets. This is why I say these two stocks have enticing upside.That said, both Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox have meager revenue streams and enormous losses, as the chart below shows.  Data by YCharts.  Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are very high-risk stocks, and investing in them should not be taken lightly. Both have an elevated chance of failing, and Nvidia's investment in them shouldn't be viewed as something that guarantees success.It's exciting to think about what could happen if things go right, and AI leads these two companies to major breakthroughs. Investors just need to keep their emotions in check, fully recognizing the risks that come with these stocks.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Short sellers are those who essentially bet that a stock will go down. They will borrow shares and then sell them on the open market \u2013 this is what it means to be \u201cshort\u201d the stock. And if the stock falls, the short seller will then buy the stock to \u201ccover\u201d their position \u2013 hopefully at a lower price, making a tidy profit in the process.  When there are a lot of short sellers shorting a stock, it can cause the stock to pull back sharply. I should also add that some have no problem playing dirty by spreading nasty rumors to scare everyday investors out of a stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This is exactly what happened to NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). NVDA had been on a tear for much of the year \u2013 up more than 46% by February 16. However, on Tuesday, February 20, the day before NVIDIA\u2019s all-important fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, the stock dropped as much as 6.7% on above-average volume on no major news. But the reality is that over the weekend, rumors of NVIDIA \u201cround-tripping\u201d resurfaced. Round-tripping is when a company pads its numbers by selling an asset to another company, only to buy it back at a similar price later on. That is a serious accusation because it is considered to be unethical and even illegal. In the case of NVIDIA, it invested $872 million in 38 startups through the first nine months of 2023. This compares to $83 million invested in the first nine months in 2022. \u00a0But it was believed that NVIDIA invested to ultimately benefit itself, according to The Information: These deals help Nvidia earn loyalty from leading AI companies, and, because most of them are Nvidia customers, the company stands to earn back the capital. Critics have described the way firms like Nvidia account for revenue from these startups as \u201cround tripping.\u201d  Now, during a CNBC International interview last Tuesday, I was asked if there was any truth to the rumors.    This was my response\u2026 [NVIDIA] is a real company. It keeps guiding higher. Their backlog for chips keeps getting bigger. I have no evidence of them padding anything\u2026 These short sellers are scum. If you really want to get your ratings up, I\u2019ll have to be in studio with a short seller, and we\u2019ll be on the ground when we\u2019re done with that session. These are scummy, nasty people, and I don\u2019t appreciate them taking great stocks and ruining the party.    Story Continues Well, as we now know following NVIDIA\u2019s phenomenal earnings results, its growth is quite real:Fourth-quarter revenue soared 265% year-over-year to a record $22.1 billion. Fourth-quarter earnings jumped 486.4% year-over-year to $5.16 per share. Total revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, or 126% annual revenue growth. Fiscal year 2024 earnings came in at $12.96 per share, or 288% annual earnings growth. Ahead of NVIDIA\u2019s earnings report, short interest stood at a whopping $18.3 billion, making the AI chip manufacturer the most heavily shorted stock in the semiconductor sector.But the short sellers couldn\u2019t have been more wrong \u2013 and that triggered a major short squeeze in the stock. So, in today\u2019s Market 360, I\u2019ll review what a short squeeze is and how it impacted NVIDIA\u2019s share price. I\u2019ll also explain why short sellers should never bet against a fundamentally superior stock, and where you can find the most superior stocks.What Is a Short Squeeze?A short squeeze is essentially when traders who were betting that a stock was going to drop are \u201csqueezed out\u201d of the trade if the stock moves higher. In order to short the stock, they had to essentially borrow the shares on margin, and then sell them to someone else. If the stock goes too far up \u2013 and their positions go too far in the red \u2013 their brokers will come knocking to collect on this \u201cloan.\u201dAs a result, the short sellers are forced to close out of their positions and buy the stock, which drives the stock price even higher. Think of it like shaking a can of soda and then opening it \u2013 the soda practically spurts out and makes a huge mess!Short squeezes tend to be triggered by good news, like a strong earnings report, which is what we saw with NVIDIA. Thanks to the results, short sellers had to cover their positions and take a beating in the process. They lost nearly $3 billion when shares of NVIDIA swung up 15% on Thursday, according to S3 Partners.I\u2019ll admit, there is nothing more pleasurable in life for me other than squeezing shorts. Not to be too dramatic, but I want to destroy every single one of them, and I hope they go out of business.The reason why is simple. Other than a few risk-taking individual investors, short sellers are often well-heeled hedge funds. And sometimes an easy way for them to make money is to scare regular investors out of a stock. However, earnings season can throw a wrench in their plans, because this is when a company \u2013 like NVIDIA \u2013 can prove that it does have the numbers to justify its rapid growth. Investors then know that there was no truth to the rumors and may jump back into the stock.Where to Park Your Hard-Earned MoneyThe bottom line: Never bet against a fundamentally superior stock\u2026 especially during earnings season. Earnings will come out and bury all the short sellers.It\u2019s why I only invest in healthy companies with strong underlying fundamentals, sales and earnings that will drive them higher over time.And that\u2019s exactly what I do in Growth Investor.My Growth Investor companies are all fundamentally superior, and when they report earnings, they usually jump because there is significant future upside and not because short sellers are simply running for cover.It\u2019s why my Growth Investor stocks continue to dramatically outpace the S&P 500. In the past three months, my average Growth Investor stock has surged 29.7%, while the S&P 500 has gained 14.6%. I should also add that my average Growth Investor stock posted an average earnings surprise of 8.9% after posting 17.9% average sales growth and 147.5% earnings growth. And yet, my Growth Investor stocks trade at only 18.3 times median forecasted earnings. So, they are not overvalued, which means they should continue to appreciate in value.Institutional investors are now aggressively accumulating my Growth Investor stocks, which is why my stocks beat the S&P 500 by over 2-to-1 in the past three months.To further position my Growth Investor Buy Lists for profits, I am adding four new stocks \u2013 three high-growth companies and one dividend play \u2013 in tomorrow\u2019s Growth Investor Monthly Issue for March.Join me at Growth Investor today so you can receive my newest recommendations as soon as they\u2019re published.

Should You?      Keith Speights, The Motley Fool   February 19, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          MSFT            Aswath Damodaran deserves his nickname of the \"Dean of Valuation.\" He teaches corporate finance and valuation at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Damodaran has written multiple papers and books on valuation, including The Little Book of Valuation targeted for a general audience. He also regularly provides data on corporate valuations on his website.  Any list of the world's most prominent stock valuation experts will include Damodaran. When he thinks a stock is overvalued or undervalued, it's usually a good idea to pay attention. That's why it caught my eye when the \"Dean of Valuation\" recently revealed that he's selling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock hand over fist.   Image source: Nvidia.   Damodaran's assessment of the \"Seven Samurai\" Damodaran likes to refer to Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla as the \"Seven Samurai.\" They're more popularly known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Damadoran, though, thinks these stocks are akin to the characters in Akira Kurosawa's classic movie The Seven Samurai who save a village from bandits. In his view, the seven stocks \"saved investors from having back-to-back disastrous years in the stock market.\" In a blog post earlier this month, Damodaran noted that investors who haven't owned at least some of these stocks over the last decade would have had a difficult task in beating the market. In 2012, the combined market caps of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks totaled $1.1 trillion. By the end of 2023, their combined market cap had soared to $12 trillion -- greater than all of the publicly traded stocks in China.  Nvidia has delivered the biggest gains of the \"Magnificent Seven\" by far. Over the last 10 years, the chipmaker's shares have skyrocketed by more than 165x. The stock has more than tripled in value over the last 12 months. Damodaran wrote that all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies \"qualify as very good to awesome, as businesses.\" However, he believes that only Meta and Tesla are close to being fairly valued while the rest are overvalued. What Damodaran thinks about Nvidia With Nvidia's sizzling-hot returns, it's not surprising that Damodaran views the stock as the most overvalued of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" He recently posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that Nvidia \"is a bridge too far for me.\" Damodaran stated that he planned to sell half of his position in the stock.   Story Continues The NYU professor isn't pessimistic about Nvidia's growth prospects, though. His valuation model assumed that the company will be able to increase its revenue by a compound annual growth rate of more than 32% over the next five years. Damodaran also projected that Nvidia will achieve an exceptional operating margin of 40%. He noted that he \"built in substantial value\" from artificial intelligence (AI) in his valuation of Nvidia.But even with great expectations for Nvidia, Damodaran still thinks the stock is way overvalued. His model calculated a fair value for the stock of around $436. That's 40% below Nvidia's current share price.Should you sell Nvidia stock, too?I don't think that all investors should rush to the sidelines with Nvidia just because a prominent valuation expert is aggressively selling his shares. Damodaran acknowledged that his valuation analysis of Nvidia could be off if AI provides a significantly greater tailwind than he expects. I think that's a possibility.He performed a similar valuation analysis of Nvidia last summer. Damodaran sold half of his position in the stock then, too. He left a lot of money on the table as a result.However, investors should take heed that Nvidia probably is priced for perfection. Any interruption in the company's remarkable growth would likely cause a major sell-off. In my view, though, a sharp decline in Nvidia's share price could also present a great buying opportunity.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company scores an F in the MarketMasterAI stock-picking system, and my most recent February algorithm update only gives NVDA stock 3.5% upside over the next six months. Companies historically sell off after enormous run-ups, and Nvidia\u2019s 400% rise since 2021 lands it squarely in that camp. Super-normal profits, after all, tend to attract unwanted competition.\nBut Nvidia is not a normal company. The company has a commanding first-mover advantage in AI accelerator chips, a product that\u2019s seen insatiable demand from cloud computing providers. The Silicon Valley-based firm has been lucky; Nvidia\u2019s decision to remain a fabless producer (i.e. outsourcing production to others) only worked because its primary partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) proved to be so capable. And Nvidia\u2019s management had the uncommon foresight to keep its GPU software proprietary, essentially locking in developers.\nTogether, that\u2019s created a computing behemoth that even the best quantitative algorithms cannot fully comprehend. A bull case for a $1,600 price target for Nvidia is emerging. And here\u2019s why it can realistically happen.\nNvidia\u2019s Path to $1,600 Per Share: CUDA Software\nIn the mid-2000s, Nvidia began developing CUDA, a software platform designed to run multiple processors in parallel. The goal was to create a solution for general computing on graphic processing units (GPUs) \u2014 essentially a way for ordinary programs to interact with these new chips.\nThese efforts were wildly successful.\nSince then, CUDA has become the standard software for everything from computer games to AI training. The ecosystem includes entire libraries, optimizing tools, a compiler, and a runtime library to deploy applications. MarketMasterAI uses these tools to run on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs.\nMeanwhile, the business side of CUDA has been even more notable. The system remains a closed-source platform, creating a lock-in effect to Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Any code optimized for Nvidia\u2019s products must be rewritten to run on other systems.\nThat\u2019s created a formidable barrier to entry. Data centers running on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs have high switching costs to move systems. Even if Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) develops a strong competitor to Nvidia\u2019s H100, the costs of moving to AMD\u2019s ROCm platform will dissuade many from making the switch. In other words, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will remain the gold standard for AI model training for the foreseeable future.\nThese facts are virtually impossible for quantitative systems to detect. All an algorithm sees is a company whose growth is expected to slow in the coming years; Wall Street expects Nvidia\u2019s net profit growth to slow to 70% in 2025 and then decline to 17.5% in 2026.\nBut the economics are clear: Nvidia\u2019s fabless business model and high lock-in effects create immense profits from a tiny capital base. Analysts estimate the chipmaker\u2019s returns on capital invested (ROIC) will expand from 100% today to 185% by 2026, helping Nvidia generate $66 billion of annual free cash flow. Even if Nvidia\u2019s ROIC falls a third by 2046, a 3-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model still values Nvidia at $1,600 a share, 140% upside. As analysts at Morningstar note, \u201cNvidia dominates AI today and the sky is the limit for the company\u2019s profitability if it can maintain this lead over the next decade.\u201d\nThe Risks to Nvidia\nHowever, Nvidia\u2019s $1,600 price target comes with significant risks.\n\nCompetition. The greatest concern is that one (or more) competitor releases a solid alternative to Nvidia and its CUDA software. We\u2019re already seeing some strong contenders. In December, AMD launched the MI300, a 3D chip that supposedly runs 20%-40% faster than Nvidia\u2019s flagship H100s. Intel could soon launch rival systems of its own.\nGrowth. Nvidia has faced unexpectedly stiff challengers in autonomous driving from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and others. Automakers have also been wary of locking themselves into a single computing standard. That means most of Nvidia\u2019s growth will come from AI training \u2014 leaving all its eggs in a single basket.\nCyclical Demand. Data centers and gaming are historically boom-bust industries, with years of super-normal growth punctuated by sudden slowdowns. Though Nvidia\u2019s asset-light model protects the company from financial issues, the sudden evaporation of demand will set the firm\u2019s profits back several years.\n\nTogether, that means Nvidia\u2019s free cash flow could decline from 2027 onwards. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plan to launch in-house GPUs in the coming years, and merely the threat of these new entrants could force Nvidia to reduce prices and accept lower margins. Re-running a 3-stage DCF model with more conservative assumptions reduces its fair value to $320. (This assumes ROIC drops to 28% and growth to 3.3% by 2047).\nNvidia\u2019s $1,600 price target also assumes that the company will be able to achieve 21% average growth through 2046 and maintain high returns on capital. This will become increasingly difficult as cloud computing demand shifts from building new AI capacity to replacing existing servers.\nWe\u2019re already seeing the limits to Nvidia\u2019s growth. In 2023, the firm returned $9.6 billion of its cash to investors after finding nowhere else to invest it. And only time will tell whether this is the start of a more worrying trend.\nShould You Buy Nvidia Stock?\nThe problem with valuing a company like Nvidia is that most of its cash flows are far into the future. Only 8% of Nvidia\u2019s current market capitalization is explained by cash flow over the next three years, while the next 20 years explain 33% of Nvidia\u2019s value. The remaining 63% of Nvdia\u2019s value sits beyond 2046. By comparison, cash-generating Qualcomm will justify almost 20% of its value in the next 3 years.\n\nThat means tiny changes in today\u2019s assumptions will have outsized impacts on Nvidia\u2019s justified value. Increasing growth rates by just 1% annually from 2027 onwards raises Nvidia\u2019s fair value by 14.5%, all else equal. Shrinking growth by 1% cuts 12.2% from its market capitalization\u2026 more than the entire market capitalization of Intel. That makes an investment in Nvidia riskier than people might expect\u2026 which is why MarketMasterAI could be right about the company\u2019s chances over the next six months.\nNevertheless, Nvidia has surprised investors before. The company remains the only notable player in AI training. And if its competitors fail to launch compelling alternatives, investors can expect Nvidia to keep rising from here. After all, the sky\u2019s the limit when it comes to AI.\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held a LONG position in GOOG and GOOGL.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.1%, or almost 50 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.3% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.  Stocks are lagging, with the focus fixed on looming results from Nvidia, whose shares fell almost 3% on Tuesday for their worst day since Oct. 17 as investors positioned for the release. The stock extended that loss on Wednesday, falling more than 3% heading into its earnings release. Expectations are running high for the chipmaker's fourth quarter results, seen both as a barometer for the AI trade and as a potential turning point for stocks more broadly. The market is on edge for any disappointment in the report, expected after the bell. Nvidia is one of a small group of megacaps behind a big chunk of recent gains for stock indexes. Mixed prospects for growth among those \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have prompted hedge funds to cut holdings, according to Goldman Sachs. In corporates, shares of Palo Alto Networks (PANW) tumbled over 28% after the cybersecurity provider cut its annual revenue forecast, igniting concerns about a potential pullback in tech spending. Meanwhile, Walgreens shares (WBA) slid as much as 3% after the pharmacy giant lost its spot on the blue-chip Dow index to Amazon (AMZN).  Minutes from the Fed's January meeting released on Wednesday showed most Fed officials \"noted the risks of moving too quickly\" in easing interest rates during the most recent meeting. Recent discouraging data has prompted a wavering in conviction that the central bank will cut rates in June, seen as the most probable timing. After the closing bell, Nvida reported fourth quarter earnings, and first quarter revenue guidance, that exceeded Wall Street's lofty expectations. The company guided for first quarter revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%, above Wall Street's projections for $21.9 billion. Shares rose as much as 7% in after hours trading.

Advanced Chart     Thu, February 22, 2024 at 5:04 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Stocks rally late in day, S&P 500 closes in the green US stocks rallied late in the day on Wednesday as investors counted down to high-stakes earnings from AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) and digested the release of Federal Reserve minutes that reiterated the central bank's focus on not cutting interest rates too soon.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.1%, or almost 50 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.3% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.  Thu, February 22, 2024 at 4:23 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Don't panic over the 'short-term story' of Nvidia earnings, strategist says Earnings results from the AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) are set to hit the tape after the close on Wednesday. As we've covered extensively over the last few days, these results are expected to be a litmus test for the AI narrative, and perhaps the current market rally as whole. Given the stock's more than 200% rise over the past year, even if the company tops its massive expectations, the attractiveness of the stock trading near all-time highs will serve as a signal of investors' risk appetite.But Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni cautioned that investors shouldn't read too far into Wednesday's report, even if it proves to be a market moving event.\"It's a very short-term story,\" Yardeni said.Yardeni, who has a 5,400 year-end target on the S&P 500 for 2024 and sees the benchmark index reaching 6,500 by the end of 2026, believes AI will play a role in that rise. But it's not the whole story.\"[Nvidia's report] is obviously viewed as a big deal,\" Yardeni said. \"But overall there's more going on in this economy than just Nvidia or artificial intelligence. The reality is that the economy proves to be remarkably resilient. It continues to grow at a good pace. Inflation's come down despite the fact that the unemployment rate remains below 4%.\"So it's been a great economy and the stock market reflects that. I don't think the AI story is the entire story here.\"   Thu, February 22, 2024 at 4:04 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Trending tickers Wednesday afternoon Palo Alto Networks (PANW) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday afternoon as shares tumbled more than 28% after the company's latest quarterly results were released on Tuesday afternoon. The cybersecurity company, whose stock had risen more than 100% over the past year, missed Wall Street's expectations for current year revenue guidance. Palo Alto guided for full-year revenue in a range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion, below analyst expectations for $8.18 billion.Shares of fellow cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Zscaler (ZS) also sold off on the news, falling more than 10% after Palo Alto's report.Meanwhile, Teladoc Health (TDOC) shares fell more than 25% following the company's latest quarterly results release. Teladoc's earnings per share and revenue guidance for 2024 fell short of Wall Street's estimates as CEO Jason Gorevic described the telehealth market as \"fairly well-penetrated.\"  Thu, February 22, 2024 at 3:25 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Fed minutes show 'most' officials acknowledge 'risks of moving too quickly' on rate cuts The minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting, released on Wednesday, showed officials remain cautious on cutting interest rates too soon.\"Most participants noted the risks of moving too quickly to ease the stance of policy,\" the minutes said.Meanwhile, only a \"couple\" officials highlighted the downside risks of holding policy in a restrictive stance.The major stock averages ticked down slightly after the minutes reiterated many of the same talking points Fed officials have recently been touting, including that further confidence is needed that inflation will continue on its path downward.Markets are continuing to price in the first interest rate cut in June. As of Wednesday afternoon, investor bets placed a 73% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates in June, per the CME FedWatch Tool.   Thu, February 22, 2024 at 2:45 AM GMT+8 Seana Smith  No dip-buying in Palo Alto Networks It\u2019s a brutal day for Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and its cast of cybersecurity rivals.In fact, there has been very little dip-buying in the stock judging by the action all day. The ticker has also remained tops on Yahoo Finance since this morning.Shares of the cybersecurity play \u2014 and AI investor favorite \u2014 are selling off by close to 30% amid a shift in growth strategy towards free incentives that has sparked concern on the Street.But, Advisors Capital Management Partner JoAnne Feeney\u00a0cautioned, the steep sell-off isn\u2019t a sign of weakening AI demand. And in fact, investors should use the dip in share price as an opportunity to \"get in.\"Bold, and indeed contrarian on a day like this for Palo Alto.\u201cYou have a lot of short-term holders that recognize the next few months could be bumpy. ... There's questions about how much growth they can generate because of this shift in strategy,\u201d Feeney told me on Yahoo Finance Live. \u201cBut when you look into that shift, and what it portends for the future, it's a lot more potential to take market share.\u201dUltimately, the stock is on track for its biggest intraday drop on record. Rivals CrowdStrike (CRWD), Fortinet (FTNT), and Zscaler (ZS) also declined on the results as investors brace for Palo Alto-like warnings.   Thu, February 22, 2024 at 2:15 AM GMT+8 Alexandra Canal  A new era of the streaming bundle has arrived Media companies like Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) used to compete for subscribers to their streaming services. Now, they are looking to team up too.Disney's ESPN, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox (FOXA) announced they would launch a sports streaming service this upcoming fall. Meanwhile, Paramount (PARA) and Peacock owner Comcast (CMCSA) have held discussions about a potential joint streaming venture, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.The developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\"Big Tech is now in this game,\" Jon Christian, executive vice president of digital media supply chain at entertainment consulting firm Qvest, told Yahoo Finance. \"These are highly diversified businesses that have a lot of money. It's a much different set of competitors for these legacy networks and studios.\"As a result, consolidation through mergers and acquisitions or partnerships is the only way for these traditional players to compete, according to Christian.\"At the end of the day, you have to look at the consumer and ask, 'What is the least amount of friction for the end user to be able to view my content?'\" he said.The concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services. The move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, represents a clear strategy shift.\"It's more of an evolution as the industry matures, and the focus has become on maximizing profits,\" Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin told Yahoo Finance.Read more here.   Thu, February 22, 2024 at 1:30 AM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  The dust settles on Roku\u2026 Ugly.Brutal 32% sell-off in Roku (ROKU) over the past week (Nasdaq off by 2% roughly \u2026 before those Nvidia earnings) on fears Walmart\u2019s (WMT) Vizio (VZIO) deal will hammer Roku\u2019s account numbers and bottom line. Roku founder Anthony Wood \u2014 who owns 14% of the company \u2014 has seen his net worth tank about $400 million year to date.Tough being a wealthy person, ain\u2019t it?The question some on the Street are asking is what in the world do you do with Roku\u2019s damaged stock? Digging through equity research on the company, I don\u2019t think anyone has the answer yet!But I believe JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter (who downgraded his rating \u2026 today) has a solid view on where things stand:\u201cThe Walmart & Vizio tie-up makes Vizio a stronger competitor, and we\u2019d expect Walmart to switch its house TV brand (onn.) from Roku\u2019s operating system to SmartCast. We believe onn. is likely one of Roku\u2019s bigger TV partners after TCL, and for reference Roku has 30+ TV partners globally. However, we\u2019d be surprised to see any material Roku active account impact until perhaps early 2025, with the VZIO acquisition not expected to close until 2Q, after which onn. TVs need to be integrated with VZIO\u2019s SmartCast operating system. We are less worried about Roku Device revenue impact, despite Walmart historically accounting for ~30% of Roku Device revenue (Amazon + Walmart = 59% of 2022 Device revenue; we assume a roughly equal split).We expect Walmart to continue carrying Roku products, and while shelf space could be compromised, in our view other retailers (i.e., Target, Best Buy) are likely to be less keen to promote Walmart-owned Vizio TVs, potentially resulting in improved Roku shelf space at their locations. Said succinctly, we see minimal risk to our 2024 Roku estimates from the Walmart & Vizio tie-up, but we recognize the combination of Roku guiding to decelerating Platform growth and overhangs from Amazon Prime AVOD + Walmart/Vizio integration could limit share upside in the near-term. However, we remain bullish on the secular growth of connected TV and Roku\u2019s longer-term monetization opportunity as ad dollars increasingly shift from linear to streaming, and in our view Roku\u2019s recent pull-back presents a compelling entry point for longer-term investors.\u201d  Thu, February 22, 2024 at 12:52 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  The waiting is the hardest part  The story in markets on Wednesday won't come until after the closing bell.Nvidia, the leader of the AI hype cycle, is slated to report quarterly results after the market close and the company has sky-high expectations to meet.Consensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of about $20.4 billion. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.Those lofty projections come after Nvidia has consistently topped expectations by a wide margin since its blowout report last May. Nvidia's stock itself has run up more than 200% in the past year and the story behind it has sent the stock market into an AI-driven frenzy.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.18 -2.35 (-1.97%)  As of 2:55:39 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart   The company's influence has been wide ranging. Its investments in smaller AI plays have caught attention and recently sent shares of SoundHound (SOUN) up nearly 60% in a day. Its overall talk of AI demand has had investors betting on what could be the next AI winner and sent shares of company's like SuperMicro Computer (SMCI) and Palantir (PLTR) roaring.But this could come at a cost, too, if the company fails to meet expectations. And that's what Wall Street will be watching for on Wednesday night.Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills that the report could be \"very difficult\" for markets.\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Sosnick said.   Thu, February 22, 2024 at 12:00 AM GMT+8 Brooke DiPalma  Big Food pitches investors down in Florida Big Food is itching to hit the reset button on its narrative with investors, who have soured on the group amid the spread of the Ozempic craze, and consumers balking at still inflationary prices.Enter CAGNY, more formally known as the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.The event is well underway in Boca Raton, Fla., where major packaged food brands with juicy dividend payouts such as PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), Hershey's (HSY), Conagra Brands (CAG), and Molson Coors (TAP), among others, are presenting.While the conference is set to run through Friday, I have spotted a few early themes from being here on the ground chatting up sources and sitting in on presentations:Eyes on volume: As Americans pull back on just how much they're buying because of high prices (see chocolate), the volume recovery is in focus. Execs at both General Mills (GIS) and Conagra were \"hesitant to comment on whether fiscal 2025 (beginning in June) could be a return to growth in line with long-term targets,\" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients from the event.Hershey and Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) called on \"price pack architecture\" with different size and price point offerings, as another potential growth lever. \"We've always capitalized on having different price points, different pack sizes so that there's accessibility for everyone,\"Hershey CEO Michele Buck said.Innovation, as well as marketing with new partners, are other key tactics to re-engage consumers. Hershey's, for example, excited the crowd with NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal in attendance to announce a tie-up to \u201cwin\u201d in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment. Conagra Brands shared that Dolly Parton's baking line is expanding into frozen shelves.The Potential for deals: M&A chatter is alive and well, not too far removed from Campbell Soup's (CPB) big deal for pasta sauce maker Sovos Brands and J.M. Smucker (SJM) buying Twinkie king Hostess Brands.While no major announcements were made (yet), many companies are teasing that they're open to the idea of deals, but are waiting for the right company to come along at the right price.It may not be a traditional acquisition one would think, though. Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told me that similar to Walmart's acquisition of Vizio this week, perhaps you could see \"food staples companies acquiring differentiated tech companies\" to gain a deeper understanding of consumers.  Wed, February 21, 2024 at 11:28 PM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Addition of Amazon helps Dow Jones stay 'relevant' The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got more relevant.On Tuesday night S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets and Amazon was a natural selection at this point,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.He added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"The swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence exposure, healthcare, and e-commerce shopping for everyday products far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt said, was crucial in influencing the switch.\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields where we would\u2019ve wanted to increase on it,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you\u2019re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that\u2019s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"Silverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120-year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.But one reason a company can be swapped out of the index is a deterioration in its stock price. Walgreens has seen that recently with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Amazon.com, Inc.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way lower, down 0.5% on the heels of Tuesday's declines.   Wed, February 21, 2024 at 9:42 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  TrendWatch: Here Comes Talk of Deflation From inflation to the opposite of inflation.Deflation is starting to creep up into the conference calls and presentations of consumer companies. It\u2019s also starting to impact top-line sales trends as prices, well, deflate.Where we have heard deflation used already this week:Tuesday's Home Depot Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned six times on the conference call.\u201cDeflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket by 35 basis points during the fourth quarter, driven by deflation in lumber and copper wire. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see, on average, a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago.\u201d -Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising at Home Depot (HD) Tuesday's Walmart Earnings Call: Deflation was mentioned two times on the conference call:\u201cDuring our Q3 call, I mentioned that we might find ourselves in a deflationary position early in calendar 2024. In Walmart US, we're there in general merchandise, but the slope of the decline softened during Q4, meaning the prices are lower than a year ago, but not as much as the trend line would have suggested at the end of Q3. We saw the trend line for food and consumables in Walmart US soften too, resulting in our retail prices in food and consumables being slightly higher than a year ago.\u201d Doug McMillon, Walmart (WMT) CEO This is a topic I plan to dive into at 10:40 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance Live in a chat with the CEO of Mondelez (MDLZ), Dirk Van de Put. The Oreo maker's sales outlook at the CAGNY conference (where Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has been stationed this week, firing off these interesting insights) yesterday suggests it's poised to overcome deflation in 2024, but more to come from our interview soon.  Wed, February 21, 2024 at 8:49 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  Palo Alto Networks gets pummeled If you could only hear the chatter very early in the morning in the Yahoo Finance newsroom on one of the more favorite tickers on our platform, lightning-hot tech play Palo Alto Networks (PANW)...The a.m. team seems to be of the view that Palo Alto Networks is unstoppable (which is probably in line with a lot of you who have traded this name in the past two years). I get it: The stock gained 377% in the past five years before the 22% premarket, post-earnings drubbing today. Palo Alto\u2019s meteoric stock price has been supported by strong rates of growth amid demand for cybersecurity products.But I reminded the team that several things appeared to change fundamentally around Palo Alto Networks last night. And if you put them together, the steep sell-off looks warranted, and the stock may stay capped in the near term until investors get more comfortable.For one, the company\u2019s billings outlook was 10% below consensus expectations. Palo Alto Networks said it\u2019s seeing some federal demand softness. I fancy there is more here, though \u2014 specifically around demand softness from big companies \u2014 akin to what we heard from Cisco (CSCO) last week (it\u2019s also in the cybersecurity business).And two, Palo Alto Networks surprised the Street via a new pricing strategy. It\u2019s one that could impact profit margins this year and perhaps into 2025.The strategy shift reflects Palo Alto Networks more aggressively trying to gain market share by giving customers short-term access to solutions for \"free.\"\"This pricing/bundling/consolidation strategy can weigh on results over the next 12-18 months,\" warned Stifel analyst Adam Borg in a client note this morning.Welcome to the show-me story zone, PANW.

The semiconductor giant overtook the likes of Amazon and Alphabet and now sports a market cap of nearly $2 trillion.\nNvidia benefits from the fast-growing demand for AI chips. Its revenue and earnings have grown at a stellar pace in the past few quarters as customers have been queuing up to get their hands on the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for training large language models -- the foundation for popular generative AI applications such as ChatGPT.\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nThe good part is that the demand for AI chips is expected to clock a terrific annual growth rate of 38% through 2032, generating a whopping $383 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period. Given that Nvidia is the leader in this space with an estimated market share of 85%, according to investment bank Raymond James, the chipmaker should continue to record solid growth in 2024 and beyond.\nBut will that be enough to help Nvidia increase its market cap to $3 trillion? Let's find out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's stellar growth is here to stay\nThe robust demand for AI chips supercharged Nvidia's data center business. The company's data center revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year 2024 jumped to $47.5 billion from $15 billion in fiscal 2023. It is worth noting that Nvidia's data center revenue was up 41% in fiscal 2023, which means that this segment grew at a much faster pace last year thanks to AI chip demand.\nMorningstar estimates that Nvidia's data center revenue could increase to $60 billion in the current fiscal year, followed by a 23% jump in the next fiscal year. However, Nvidia's consensus revenue estimates for the current and the next fiscal year have been heading higher.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nThat's not surprising, as recent results from cloud service providers who have been buying Nvidia's graphics cards indicate that its customers are set to increase their AI-related spending. Nvidia should deliver stronger growth over the next couple of fiscal years. Another reason Nvidia could outpace analysts' expectations is because of its move into the market for custom AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company reportedly held discussions with its cloud customers to develop application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). A move into this fast-growing custom chip market could unlock a revenue opportunity worth $55 billion for Nvidia and help accelerate its already impressive growth. That could lead to even more stock upside over the next couple of years and boost Nvidia's market cap further.\nCan it become a $3 trillion company?\nJust like Nvidia's revenue estimates have been raised by analysts, its earnings per share estimates are also getting a boost.\n\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nNvidia's earnings could jump to $29.24 per share in fiscal 2026 (which mostly coincides with calendar year 2025). That's a nice jump from the earnings of around $20 per share the company was anticipated to deliver earlier. With Nvidia's potential move into a new area such as custom AI chips, the company could end fiscal 2026 with a higher earnings figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming Nvidia's earnings jump to $30 per share in the next fiscal year and the company trades at 42 times earnings at that time -- in line with its five-year average forward earnings multiple -- its stock price could increase to $1,260 per share within the next couple of years. That would be a 60% increase from the current level.\nBased on Nvidia's current market cap of $1.97 trillion, a 60% jump from here would send its market cap to $3.15 trillion. So there is a solid possibility of Nvidia becoming a $3 trillion company by the end of next year. Investors should consider buying Nvidia right away because it is trading at 38 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average forward earnings multiple.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This would amount to an astounding 426% from a year ago and is the reason why Nvidia stock has gained 230% in just the last year.\u00a0\nRevenue is projected to rise 240% YoY to just shy of $20.6 billion as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) related server chips grows exponentially. Nvidia is the company at the heart of the supposed \u201cAI revolution,\u201d\u00a0and competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are simply picking up the scraps.\nFor the quarter at hand, Nvidia has received more than 30 upward revisions to both earnings and revenue and not one lower revision. Goldman Sachs surprised the market earlier this month, when it upgraded its NVDA stock price target from $620 to $800 per share as the investment bank\u2019s analyst said demand for AI chips would not let up in 2024.\nNvidia\u2019s stock price will likely gyrate based on CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s guidance for the 2024 calendar year (fiscal 2025). The current consensus calls for $21.51 in adjusted EPS on revenue of $91.3 billion for the full year.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nNvidia FAQs\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia known for?\nNvidia is the leading fabless designer of graphics processing units or GPUs. These sophisticated devices allow computers to better process graphics for display interfaces by accelerating computer memory and RAM. This is especially true in the world of video games, where Nvidia graphics cards became a mainstay of the industry. Additionally, Nvidia is well-known as the creator of its CUDA API that allows developers to create software for a number of industries using its parallel computing platform. Nvidia chips are leading products in the data center, supercomputing and artificial intelligence industries. The company is also viewed as one of the inventors of the system-on-a-chip design.\n\n\nWhat is the history of Nvidia?\nCurrent CEO Jensen Huang founded Nvidia with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993. All three founders were semiconductor engineers, who had previously worked at AMD, Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. The team set out to build more proficient GPUs than currently existed in the market and largely succeeded by late 1990s. The company was founded with $40,000 but secured $20 million in funding from Sequoia Capital venture fund early on. Nvidia went public in 1999 under the ticker NVDA. Nvidia became a leading designer of chips to the data center, PC, automotive and mobile markets through its close relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\n\nWhat is Nvidia\u2019s relationship to artificial intelligence?\nIn 2022, Nvidia released its ninth-generation data center GPU called the H100. This GPU is specifically designed with the needs of artificial intelligence applications in mind. For instance, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and GPT-4 large language models (LLMs) rely on the H100\u2019s high efficiency in parallel processing to execute a high number of commands quickly. The chip is said to speed up networks by six times Nvidia\u2019s previous A100 chip and is based on the new Hopper architecture. The H100 chip contains 80 billion transistors. Nvidia\u2019s market cap reached $1 trillion in May 2023 largely on the promise of its H100 chip becoming the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d of the coming AI revolution.\n\n\nWhy does Jensen Huang have a cult following?\nLong-time CEO Jense Huang has a cult following in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street due to his strict loyalty and determination to build Nvidia into one of the world\u2019s leading companies. Nvidia neary fell apart on several occasions, but each time Huang bet everything on a new technology that turned out to be the ticket to the company\u2019s success. Huang is seen as a visionary in Silicon Valley, and his company is at the forefront of most major breakthroughs in computer processing. Huang is known for his enthusiastic keynote addresses at annual Nvidia GTC conferences, as well as his love of black leather jackets and Denny\u2019s, the fast food chain where the company was founded.\n\n\n\nNvidia stock forecast\nThe worry among traders in the lead up to earnings is that Nvidia stock is showing signs of a bearish Evening Doji Star pattern on the weekly chart. This is when a Doji candlestick is perched above the previous candle\u2019s long rising candle\u00a0and followed by a bearish candlestick that closes below the midpoint of the first candlestick in the pattern.\u00a0\nAdding to the worries, the Doji candlestick from last week sits right on top of the long-term top trendline that has been creating a ceiling on NVDA stock since August\u00a02020.\nIf Nvidia stock does miss on the earnings result, then expect NVDA to crater back toward the former resistance level of $500. The 21-week Simple Moving Average is also not far above that price level.\n\nNVDA weekly stock chart\n\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow AuthorFeb 23, 2024, 03:56pm ESTShareSaveCommentFuture expected AI market growth likely outweighs present valuation concerns\n\nBy Oliver Rodzianko\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia is a leader in GPUs and SoCs, with products and services fundamental to the proliferation of AI, including deep learning abilities.\nNvidia stock is likely moderately overvalued, but the high growth expected in the AI market over the next decade justifies holding the investment.\nCurrent geopolitical risks as a result of US-China relations make investing too heavily in Nvidia riskier than usual. However, the downside potential would affect all high-technology companies.\n\n\nNvidia Corp.'s (NVDA, Financial) valuation may look unappealing to some, but my peer analysis reveals only a moderate overvaluation at most. However, this needs to be monitored closely as the technology industry is prone to speculative prices. High growth is indicated by long-term artificial intelligence market expansion forecasts and, as such, I consider the stock worth holding long term.\n\nCompany overview\nFounded in 1993, the company is a global leader in the design and manufacture of graphics processing units for the professional and gaming markets and system-on-a-chip (SoCs) units for the mobile computing and automotive markets.Nvidia's historical operating revenue by segment.GuruFocus.com\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\n\nIt is best known for its GeForce GPUs, used for gaming, professional visualization and in data centers for high-performance computation. Nvidia's GPUs are also fundamental to the development and running of artificial intelligence models and it is accelerating machine and deep learning capabilities. It has also developed a platform called Drive, which is designed for autonomous vehicles, providing the computing power necessary for self-driving technology.\n\nIts Quadro GPUs are tailored for professionals needing design, visualization and simulation, aiding high precision and performance. Additionally, Nvidia's GeForce NOW platform and service is a cloud gaming infrastructure that allows users to stream games on various devices without requiring high-end hardware.\n\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia develops software. For example, CUDA harnesses the power of GPUs for higher computing performance.\nThe company acquired Mellanox Technologies in 2020, adding networking and interconnect technology to its portfolio.\nFuture growth drivers and market outlook\nNvidia is a critical investment in long-term AI growth and major cutting-edge technologies. As such, understanding the broader market demands and growth outlook for its industry is crucial to assessing its valuation. My research proposes that Nvidia's growth may continue as the AI market expands and, as such, investors would be wise to hold the stock throughout present overvaluation concerns.\nBloomberg reported that the AI industry could grow at a compound annual rate of 42% over the next 10 years, with demand for generative AI products adding about $280 billion of new software revenue. The research estimates a $1.30 trillion AI market by 2032. Here is a breakdown of what AI segments could be worth in 2032, as outlined by Bloomberg Intelligence:\n\n\nAI infrastructure as a service - $247 billion\nDigital ads driven by AI - $192 billion\nAI servers - $132 billion\nSpecialized generative AI assistant software - $89 billion\nConversational AI devices - $108 billion\nAI storage - $93 billion\nComputer vision AI products - $61 billion\n\n\nFinancial analysis\nConsidering the high CAGR anticipated for the AI market over the next decade, it is important to put Nvidia's historical growth in perspective to understand if the stock is rationally valued at this time.\nOver the past year, Nvidia has grown its earnings per share without non-recurring items at a rate of 173.20%, which is unprecedented historically considering its 10-year average of 34.30%.Nvidia's annual EPS without NRI history with estimate.GuruFocus.com\nAlso consider free cash flow growth of 269.10% over the past year and 28.50% on average annually over the past 10 years.Nvidia's annual free cash flow data.GuruFocus.com\nConsidering the broader trend in Nvidia's industry, arguably the fastest-growing market in the world, it may be possible for the company to maintain 20% or higher earnings per share growth over the next decade. Some reduction to past results is necessary to consider due to an already established business, even considering future market CAGR expectations. My earnings growth estimate is also roughly in line with the common consensus.\nValue analysis\nMy future growth estimate leads me to my analysis of the stock valuation. I consider Nvidia's price the most significant risk when investing in it at this time. The stock has a price-earnings ratio of around 96, which comes down to around 36 based on future earnings estimates. Its forward price-earnings ratio is in the bottom 30% of companies in the semiconductors industry.\nNvidia is evidently overvalued by traditional discounted cash flow analysis, but this method is unlikely to fully account for the premium that is usually attributed to high-tech stocks. Looking for leading advanced technology companies trading below fair value is often impossible. As such, I believe a peer analysis is the better way to gauge technology company valuations.\nI think Nvidia can correctly be compared to AMD (AMD, Financial), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financial) and Broadcom (AVGO, Financial).\n\n\nAMD \u2013 forward price-earnings ratio of 52\nTaiwan Semiconductor \u2013 forward price-earnings ratio of 18\nBroadcom \u2013 forward price-earnings ratio of 27\n\n\nAs such, Nvidia does not seem unreasonably valued based on the stock price of its peers. However, it is likely there is a moderate overvaluation to consider, as indicated by the GF Value Line.Nvidia's GF Value Line.GuruFocus.com\nConsidering future earnings estimates for the next three years, including 44 analysts on consensus expecting 72.32% year-over-year growth reported in January 2025 and 30 analysts expecting on consensus 24.24% growth in January 2026, the future for Nvidia looks like it might have the most upside potential in the next few years. However, investors may want to consider how the market will react when earnings growth comes down to more reasonable levels. It could continue to price the company at a premium, or more likely, the valuation will drop to a more reasonable level, creating some short-term volatility before the stock price begins to grow more conservatively.\nIt is also important to understand Nvidia's forward price-earnings ratio of around 36 at this time is considerably lower than its median price-earnings ratio of 43.50 over the last 10 years. That could present a reasonable buying opportunity right now as long as investors are willing to tolerate some future volatility. The medium-term potential instability in the price of the stock seems worth it, considering the large long-term expected market growth of AI and Nvidia's crucial function in this area. If the market presents a moderate price drop in the stock soon, that is when I will be looking to take my first proper stake in the company.\nGeopolitical risk\nNvidia is very closely related to Taiwan Semiconductor and, as such, remains significantly exposed to geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. surrounding Taiwan at this time. While an invasion of the country seems unlikely to me based on my ongoing analysis of international relations, investors must be cautious not to allocate too heavily to technology at this time. If a larger war breaks out, I believe technology stocks will be the most significantly negatively impacted, although the broader economic effects will reach all industries.\nConclusion\nOverall, Nvidia still looks appealing to me. I would be cautious of allocating to the stock at this time too heavily, but even if bought at the present valuation, I believe long-term growth can still be expected over the next decade even if the stock experiences some volatility. My rating for the stock is a hold.\nDisclosures\nI/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and have no plans to buy any new positions in the stocks mentioned within the next 72 hours.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Significant expansion in the Data Center segment, with a 217% increase in revenue. Operational excellence reflected in increased gross margins and comprehensive income. Strategic positioning in key markets: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.   Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.  On February 21, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), a trailblazer in graphics processing units and a vanguard of artificial intelligence technology, released its 10-K filing, revealing a transformative year. The company's financials underscore its robust performance, with a staggering 126% increase in revenue to $60.9 billion, compared to the previous year. NVIDIA's strategic pivot towards data centers and AI has paid dividends, as evidenced by the 217% surge in Data Center revenue. The company's gross profit soared to $44.3 billion, reflecting operational efficiency and market demand for its innovative products. With a comprehensive income of $29.83 billion and a diluted net income per share of $11.93, NVIDIA's financial health is formidable, setting the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis.   Decoding NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): A Strategic SWOT Insight   Strengths Market Leadership in Data Center and AI: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has cemented its position as a leader in the Data Center and AI markets. The company's revenue from this segment skyrocketed by 217% in FY 2024, reaching $47.5 billion. This growth is driven by the launch of AI inference platforms and the introduction of NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations, which cater to the burgeoning demand for generative AI and large language models. NVIDIA's dominance is further evidenced by its GPUs and networking solutions powering over 75% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 24 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list. This strength not only showcases NVIDIA's technological prowess but also its ability to capture and lead high-growth markets.  Financial Robustness: NVIDIA's financial performance in FY 2024 is a testament to its strength. The company's revenue growth to $60.9 billion, coupled with a gross profit of $44.3 billion, reflects its ability to scale and capitalize on market opportunities effectively. NVIDIA's net income of $29.76 billion and a diluted net income per share of $11.93 underscore its profitability and financial stability. This financial robustness provides NVIDIA with the capital necessary to invest in research and development, expand its product offerings, and pursue strategic acquisitions, further solidifying its market position.   Story Continues WeaknessesSupply Chain Concentration: Despite its financial success, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces potential risks associated with its supply chain. The company's manufacturing operations are heavily concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, relying on foundries such as TSMC and Samsung. This concentration could expose NVIDIA to geopolitical risks, trade tensions, and supply chain disruptions, which could impact its ability to deliver products consistently and at competitive prices. Diversifying its supply chain could mitigate these risks and ensure more stable operations.Dependence on Third-Party Suppliers: NVIDIA's fabless manufacturing strategy means it depends on third-party suppliers for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. While this allows NVIDIA to focus on design and innovation, it also reduces control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules. Any disruptions or defects from suppliers could harm NVIDIA's business and reputation. Strengthening relationships with suppliers and building redundancy in the supply chain are crucial to minimizing these weaknesses.OpportunitiesExpansion into New Markets: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the opportunity to leverage its AI and GPU technologies to expand into new markets. The company's expertise in AI is applicable to a wide range of industries, including healthcare for drug discovery, automotive for self-driving technologies, and financial services for fraud detection. By tailoring its offerings to these verticals, NVIDIA can tap into new revenue streams and diversify its customer base.Generative AI and Large Language Models: The rise of generative AI and large language models presents a significant opportunity for NVIDIA. The company's AI inference platforms and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. By continuing to innovate and provide cutting-edge solutions for AI model development and training, NVIDIA can maintain its leadership and drive growth in this rapidly evolving field.ThreatsIntensifying Competition: The market for GPUs and AI computing is highly competitive, with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces competition from companies that provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, and other accelerated computing processor products. Some competitors may have greater marketing, financial, and manufacturing resources, which could challenge NVIDIA's market share. Staying ahead of the competition through continuous innovation and strategic partnerships is critical for NVIDIA's sustained success.Regulatory and Geopolitical Risks: NVIDIA's operations are subject to complex laws, rules, and regulations, which could adversely impact its business. Changes in export control rules, particularly with the strategic importance of AI, could limit NVIDIA's ability to sell its products in key markets like China and the Middle East. Additionally, geopolitical tensions could disrupt the supply chain and manufacturing operations. Proactively managing these risks and advocating for favorable regulatory environments are essential for NVIDIA's future growth.In conclusion, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) exhibits formidable strengths with its market leadership in data centers and AI, as well as its robust financial performance. However, it must navigate weaknesses related to its supply chain concentration and dependence on third-party suppliers. Opportunities for expansion into new markets and capitalizing on generative AI areThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.23% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.37%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.07%. The maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's shares have seen an increase of 32.69% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 11.06% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.3%.  Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on February 21, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $4.49, indicating a 410.23% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $20.1 billion, up 232.16% from the year-ago period. Additionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Nvidia. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits. Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.  Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With respect to valuation, Nvidia is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 34.55. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 25.15 for its industry. Also, we should mention that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 2.56. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 235, finds itself in the bottom 7% echelons of all 250+ industries.

A year ago today, Nvidia was trading around $210 per share. Today, the stock sits just under $700 per share as a result of the technological transformation we've witnessed in Artificial Intelligence, with many AI developers adopting Nvidia products to bring their ideas into the AI landscape.Nvidia has big expectations this week, as they report quarterly earnings tomorrow after the market closes at 3:20 p.m. CST. In the first earnings report after surpassing the market cap of household names like Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia has a stock price expected move of +-$77.54 based on current implied volatility. This is well above 10% of the current stock price which is right around $700 per share, putting it near the top of expected moves relative to stock price for other popular tech stocks this earnings season.Similar to the previous few quarters, we're expecting massive growth across all business sectors for Nvidia. We'll just have to see how the market digests the forecast for 2024 and whether or not Nvidia exceeds expectations in a big way, meets already heightened expectations or misses the mark this week. Is this explosive growth sustainable? And if not, how long will it last?To put more context around this week's earnings report, we can look at the expected stock price move for later-dated options expiration cycles. The higher the expected move this week relative to options cycles farther out in time, the more weight the market is putting on this quarterly earnings announcement. This week, we're looking at a +-$77.54 expected stock price move for the next three days, compared to a +-$117.72 expected stock price move for the next 59 days. This goes to show just how much movement the market is expecting from Nvidia's earnings announcement this week.Bullish on Nvidia for earnings this weekNVDA has had nothing short of an amazing year. It's hard to forget about the historic earnings rally from $300 to $400 less than a year ago, and the stock hasn't looked back since. The bullish case for Nvidia could be an explosive quarter exceeding expectations and positive sentiment for the rest of this year.It's pretty staggering to see the revenue growth in Nvidia over a year's time. In Q3 \u201923, revenue came in at $5.9 billion. A year later, Nvidia reported a quarterly revenue of $18.1 billion. We will see tomorrow whether Nvidia can post another huge number and if the market sees the earnings report in a positive way.Bearish on Nvidia for earnings this weekIt's hard to imagine AI going away, but a lot of Nvidia's recent success is directly tied to AI demand. If this changes, or if demand stalls, this could impact NVDA stock in a negative way. Most of the big companies buying into Nvidia products have stated they will continue to expand their AI efforts, which is good for NVDA's bottom line and 2024 guidance.With that said, if Nvidia misses on any earnings expectations, or if the company's supply and demand structure shifts in a negative way, we could see a bearish move in the stock price. Is the today\u2019s selloff a prequel to what's to come this week after earnings?

The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased, with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.  Following the upgrade, the current consensus from NVIDIA's 53 analysts is for revenues of US$105b in 2025 which - if met - would reflect a huge 133% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 190% to US$22.21. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$94b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$18.32 in 2025. So we can see there's been a pretty clear increase in analyst sentiment in recent times, with both revenues and earnings per share receiving a decent lift in the latest estimates.  Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth February 22nd 2024   It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for NVIDIA 14% to US$802 on the back of these upgrades. Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that NVIDIA's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 133% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 28% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 17% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that NVIDIA is expected to grow much faster than its industry. The Bottom Line The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Fortunately, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates sales are expected to perform better than the wider market. Given that the consensus looks almost universally bullish, with a substantial increase to forecasts and a higher price target, NVIDIA could be worth investigating further. With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

[+] this multiple exposure illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on February 25, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has rallied by almost 3.3x over the past 12 months to about $790 per share, taking Nvidia\u2019s market cap near the vaunted $2 trillion mark. There\u2019s a lot of reason for the optimism with Nvidia stock. As the artificial intelligence arms race gathers pace, technology companies and developers scramble to buy high-end graphics units to deploy generative AI into their applications and software. Nvidia currently dominates the market for AI silicon with chips including the A100 and H100 tailor-made for AI applications. Nvidia\u2019s earnings have also soared accordingly. The company saw revenue for Q4 FY\u201924 grow by 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, while net income surged to $12.3 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. Nvidia\u2019s chips are also meaningfully ahead of rivals such as AMD and Google\u2019s\nGOOG\n Tensor processing units in terms of performance at the moment. The company has also built an ecosystem around its AI tools, with its programming languages, and software, which are helping the company drive incremental sales and lock in customers. These software tools, coupled with higher economies of scale, are enabling the company to post record-high margins. Gross margins stood at a lofty 76% in the most recent quarter, up from about 63% in the year-ago period. Net margins stood at an incredible 55% in Q4.\n\n\nLooking at a slightly longer period, NVDA stock has seen extremely strong gains of 510% from levels of $130 in early January 2021 to around $790 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in NVDA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that NVDA underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, AAPL, and AVGO, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?\n\nLooking at Nvidia\u2019s valuation, the stock now trades at about 36x consensus 2025 earnings and 29x 2026 earnings. This is not an unreasonable multiple, considering Nvidia\u2019s heady growth. That said, there are risks as well. Firstly, the big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs.\n\n\nMoreover, competition in the market could also mount with players such as AMD investing considerably to catch up in this space given the high stakes. Additionally, big tech players such as Google, Microsoft\nMSFT\n, and Amazon\nAMZN\n are also doubling down on developing their own AI and machine learning-related silicon. This could also pose a risk for Nvidia, as the big tech players remain the company\u2019s largest customers. Over FY\u201924, the company indicated that a single customer (which was not named) accounted for 13% of its overall revenue. Big tech players could eventually slow their capex on AI-related infrastructure, as they move toward a phase of figuring out how to monetize their new capabilities.\n\nNvidia is also not immune to the geopolitics of the chip business. Given the strategic importance of AI, the U.S. government has been regulating the sales of some key products in markets such as China and the Middle East. While Nvidia has designed chips that work around these rules, further regulations could adversely impact the company\u2019s business. Moreover, geopolitical issues could also disrupt the company\u2019s supply chain. At the moment the supply of Nvidia GPUs is almost entirely reliant on Taiwan-based TSMC. Taiwan has faced mounting tensions in recent years with China, which has been asserting that Taiwan is part of its territory. We value NVDA at about $731 per share, about 7% below the market price.

On February 21, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) released its 8-K filing, revealing a record-breaking performance for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2024. The company, a leading developer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, has seen its products and services become increasingly vital in a variety of sectors, including gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.   NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Shatters Records with Q4 and Fiscal 2024 Earnings   Financial Highlights and Company Growth NVIDIA's remarkable quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion represents a 22% increase from the third quarter and a 265% increase from the same period last year. This growth was propelled by a record quarterly Data Center revenue of $18.4 billion, which is up 27% from Q3 and up 409% from the previous year. The company's full-year revenue also saw a significant uptick, reaching $60.9 billion, a 126% increase from the previous fiscal year. The company's gross margin improved notably, reaching 76.0% in the fourth quarter, up from 74.0% in the third quarter and 63.3% from the previous year. This expansion in gross margin underscores NVIDIA's ability to not only increase sales but also to do so profitably, a key indicator of financial health for value investors. Income Statement and Earnings Per Share Operating income for Q4 stood at $13.6 billion, a 31% increase from Q3 and a significant 983% increase year-over-year. Net income saw a similar trajectory, with Q4 net income reaching $12.3 billion, up 33% from the previous quarter and up 769% from the same quarter last year. The GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was $4.93, which is a 33% increase from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from the previous year. The non-GAAP diluted EPS was even higher at $5.16, marking a 28% increase from Q3 and a 486% increase year-over-year.   Story Continues These earnings figures are particularly important for NVIDIA, a company at the forefront of the semiconductor industry, as they reflect the successful adoption of its AI and GPU technologies across various sectors. The substantial increase in EPS indicates robust profitability and may signal strong future potential for the company.Challenges and Future OutlookDespite the impressive financial achievements, NVIDIA faces challenges inherent in the fast-paced and competitive semiconductor industry. Rapid technological advancements and intense competition require continuous innovation and investment in research and development. Additionally, the company's forward-looking statements suggest a focus on new product cycles and innovations, which are crucial for maintaining its market-leading position.NVIDIA's outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 anticipates revenue to be around $24.0 billion, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins expected to be approximately 76.3% and 77.0%, respectively. Operating expenses are projected to be around $3.5 billion on a GAAP basis and $2.5 billion on a non-GAAP basis.Conclusion and Investor PerspectiveNVIDIA's record-breaking earnings report for Q4 and fiscal 2024 highlights the company's strong position in the semiconductor industry, driven by its innovative AI and GPU technologies. With significant year-over-year growth in revenue, net income, and EPS, NVIDIA demonstrates its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for accelerated computing and AI.

Download here. The NVIDIA app beta is a first step in our journey to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience, and RTX Experience apps.\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest NVIDIA drivers, and enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nFeaturing a unified GPU control center, NVIDIA app allows fine-tuning of game and driver settings from a single place, while introducing a redesigned in-game overlay for convenient access to powerful gameplay recording tools, performance monitoring overlays, and game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for GeForce RTX users.\nThis initial beta release incorporates many of the top features from our existing apps, optimizes the user experience, includes an optional login to redeem bundles and rewards, and introduces new RTX capabilities to elevate your gaming and creative experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the NVIDIA app beta today and send us feedback via the NVIDIA app. During the NVIDIA app beta, GeForce Experience and the NVIDIA Control Panel will continue to be available. Read below to learn more about what to expect from the NVIDIA app today and in the coming months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnified GPU Control Center\nThe NVIDIA app integrates GeForce Experience's Optimal Game Settings and NVIDIA Control Panel's 3D Settings into a unified interface. This becomes a centralized place to review or modify optimizations while adjusting driver settings. You can customize it on a per-applications basis, or use a global profile across all games and applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new unified GPU control center with in-game settings and driver settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved Driver Information\nWhen it comes to your favorite games or applications, Game Ready Drivers and Studio Drivers ensure the ultimate experience for gamers and creators. A popular request from GeForce Experience users is for a quicker, more straightforward way to understand what's included in the latest driver updates.\nIn the new Driver page, we've introduced easy-to-scan bullet points of \u201cwhat\u2019s new\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s fixed,\u201d alongside quick callouts on game support. All driver related articles are accessible on a single carousel so you can read about game announcements or technologies associated with the driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved driver page with easy-to-scan bullets and and related articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesigned In-Game Overlay\nOur In-Game Overlay has undergone a comprehensive redesign. As before, use the convenient \"Alt+Z\" hotkey to swiftly access Shadowplay recording tools, Freestyle Game Filters, NVIDIA Highlights, photo mode, and performance monitoring tools.\nIn the NVIDIA app, we've improved the user interface, enabling quick access to features while playing your favorite game or using an application. And your captured content is now readily available in the gallery through user-friendly thumbnails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedesigned overlay to quickly access Shadowplay, Freestyle, Highlights, and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve also enhanced performance monitoring with a new statistics overlay. Gamers can now customize how the performance overlay is displayed during their gaming session with options to minimize the footprint of the HUD.\nAdditionally, gamers can now customize which performance metrics they would like to see during their gaming session. Simply hit Alt + R to toggle performance monitoring statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew performance overlays with custom statistics can be configured and enabled via Alt+R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA app also introduces Shadowplay 120 FPS video capture which enables a new level of smoothness in recorded content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew AI Freestyle Filters\nNVIDIA Freestyle empowers you to personalize the visual aesthetics of your favorite games through real-time post-processing filters. This feature boasts compatibility with a vast library of more than 1,200 games, and now NVIDIA app offers AI-powered filters, accelerated by Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs.\nRTX Dynamic Vibrance is an AI-powered Freestyle filter that improves upon the beloved Digital Vibrance feature in the NVIDIA Control Panel. RTX Dynamic Vibrance enhances visual clarity on a per app basis, providing players with a flexible and convenient way to tune their visual settings for each game. Colors pop more on screen, with perfect balance to minimize color crushing, preserving image quality and immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced visual clarity with RTX Dynamic Vibrance (click here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX HDR, a new AI-powered Freestyle filter seamlessly brings the vibrant world of High Dynamic Range (HDR) to games that were not originally equipped with HDR support. Remarkably, only 10 of the top 50 most-played GeForce games offer HDR support and there are thousands of games that only support SDR. However, with the RTX HDR filter, you can now take advantage of your HDR-compatible monitor for a broad spectrum of games running on DX12, DX11, DX9, and Vulkan platforms. Check out the NVIDIA Consumer Support Knowledge Base for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock HDR gaming with RTX HDR (image simulated for SDR displays; click here to load a fullscreen 4K comparison). Download the HDR source image for comparison on HDR displays here, and the SDR image here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedeem GeForce Bundles & Rewards\nNVIDIA app users get access to rewards, such as in-game content, exclusive GeForce NOW premium membership offers, and more.

Additionally, we'll be adding several attributes from GeForce Experience and RTX Experience, such as GPU overclocking and driver roll-back. During the NVIDIA app beta, GeForce Experience and the NVIDIA Control Panel will continue to be available.\nNot all features will be making the transition, though. Our primary goal with the NVIDIA app is to enhance the user experience, boost client performance, and pioneer RTX innovations. To achieve this, we've made the decision to discontinue a few features that were underutilized, especially where good alternatives exist.\nThis discontinuation encompasses Broadcast to Twitch and YouTube, Share Images and Video to Facebook and YouTube, and Photo Mode 360 & Stereo captures. Streamlining features helps the NVIDIA app install in half the time, deliver a 50% more responsive UI, and occupy 17% less disk space than GeForce Experience.\nWe invite you to download the new NVIDIA app beta today. On our beta roadmap, we plan to offer AV1 support for Shadowplay, additional DLSS controls, extra overclocking options, and more. Let us know what other features you\u2019d like to see. We're eager to hear your feedback so let us know through the app. Stay tuned for more updates about the NVIDIA app on GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This includes several model checkpoints of Gemma and the FP8-quantized version of the model, all optimized with TensorRT-LLM.\nExperience Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B directly from your browser on the NVIDIA AI Playground.\nGemma Coming to Chat With RTX\nAdding support for Gemma soon is Chat with RTX, an NVIDIA tech demo that uses retrieval-augmented generation and TensorRT-LLM software to give users generative AI capabilities on their local, RTX-powered Windows PCs.\n\nThe Chat with RTX lets users personalize a chatbot with their own data by easily connecting local files on an RTX PC to a large language model.\nSince the model runs locally, it provides results fast, and user data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: AI Decoded | Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | GPU | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA RTX | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Coming off the heel of the increased prices of NVIDIA 30 series graphics cards during the pandemic, we have entered into what I call the \u201csecond wave\u201d or \u201crefresh\u201d of the 40 series generation. With a ton of people questioning the validity of their product within the market for the first time in a long time, NVIDIA is facing solid criticism for their ability to deliver a product that delivers proper price for power.\nWith Intel coming into the ring again with their Arc series cards, proving to be a valid platform for cost-conscious players and AMD coming in with a little bit of a higher price-to-performance value, it is easy to look at what NVIDIA is bringing to the table and walk away from it entirely. While it might seem strange, folks are opting for AMD 6600 XT graphics cards over some of the newer options from NVIDIA.\n\nAs we begin the year of 2024, people have been asking me for advice on what they should consider when upgrading their current system or building a new one. Perhaps the biggest question I get asked: \u201cIs AMD as bad as folks are making it out to be?\u201d\n\nWell, after a couple of months playing around with an ASUS TUF RX 7800 XT, I have some very interesting results. Although, I don\u2019t want to just show you a graph focusing on the rasterization performance, as those could be found in any video review out there. Instead, I want to tell you what I found with words and a brief explanation.\n\nRealistic Expectations\nNVIDIA has always been a huge name in the market, if not, the most popular brand out there almost by default. Over the last few years they have put a huge emphasis on technologies like Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), Ray Tracing, Reflex, and more. But, it comes at a rather steep price- especially coming off the pandemic with exuberant pricing structures. I don\u2019t blame anyone for wanting to upgrade but not wanting to spend almost $800 for a decent experience.\nThere is a caveat there as PC gaming is a whole different beast. Chances are, if you are a PC gamer and tech enthusiast, you are already aware of what I am going to say. A \u201cdecent experience\u201d is relative to your expectations as a gamer. Folks wanting a 4K gaming experience on a 27\u201d monitor with 240 Hz refresh rate will spend way more money than someone who is absolutely fine with a 1080p 120 Hz experience. Hell, some folks are fine with a 60 Hz refresh rate- something that is borderline heretical to say.\n\nWhen looking at rasterizations performance, it\u2019s nice to know that a graphics card will give you 240 Hz performance, but how important is that to you? How important is DLSS- a technology that only works on a handful of games at the moment? What about Ray Tracing? These are all equally important questions, and they aren\u2019t designed to pre-load my experience with the AMD RX 7800 XT.\n\u2026but it also kinda is\u2026\n\nSwapping Over\nGoing from an RTX 3070 Ti to the RX 7800 XT is a rather interesting experience as the changes are both immense in terms of software. NVIDIA has their GeForce Experience while AMD has the Adrenaline software, both designed to manage your system\u2019s settings. While the GeForce Experience mainly focuses on the installed graphics card, AMD\u2019s Adrenaline software allows you to manage your GPU as well as your AMD-based CPU. After some time with the baseline software, getting used to AMD\u2019s approach is useful.\nThe only problem is how AMD manages their software. When I tried to play Enshrouded, the display flickered uncontrollably. This lead me to believe that my drivers needed updating, but the software didn\u2019t allow me to update. Something felt a bit odd and I discovered that this old build didn\u2019t have the \u201cupdate drivers\u201d option. After re-downloading the necessary software again, my drivers were up to snuff. Enshrouded looked absolutely great with max settings.\n\nAnother aspect to get used to is the terminology between both NVIDA and AMD. For example, NVIDIA has DLSS and AMD\u2019s has FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), both at the core are designed to do the same thing but there is a caveat. NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS is a closed-platform concept while AMD\u2019s FSR is open source, allowing others to toy around with the technology and deliver their own solutions.\nWhile FSR has had its own growing pains, thanks to the open source concept, the technology has grown. Plenty of games have started to support it. Much like DLSS, FSR can only support select titles. It doesn\u2019t mean your games will look worse, but it does mean that as both of these technologies evolve, so will your games.\nAside from the driver issue, jumping over to team red is rather seamless. Aside from making sure the GPU will fit in your case, all you need to do is remove your old drivers and just reinstall AMD\u2019s. One huge plus side is that AMD\u2019s GPUs utilize standard PCIe connectors. Sure, you might need to run three cables from the power supply, but it has been much easier to use over NVIDIA\u2019s proprietary 16-pin (12+4) connector which has caused it\u2019s own brand of discourse, setting entire computer systems on fire and leading multiple companies blaming each other (as well as the user) for the flames.\n\n\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to rasterization performance, the 7800 XT provides a really smooth experience. I have seen refresh rates up to 144 Hz, the maximum my display can handle, with a wide range of games. Granted, the 3070 Ti was also able to handle a lot of the games I threw at it. The only major difference came to some titles where I was pushing the resolution while keeping up with the enhanced graphical fidelity.\nMy current build that I tested these games features an AMD Ryzen 7 5700G, 32GB of DDR4 RAM, a 2TB Samsung EVO 980 PRO SSD, all on an ASUS TUF X570-Pro motherboard with a 750W power supply. The monitor I am using is the BenQ MOBIUZ EX3410R, which features a nice ultra-wide 34\u201d 3440 x 1440 1000R curved panel with 144 Hz refresh rate, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and 1ms response time. I also have a secondary ASUS 15\u201d USB-C 1080p portable display that is plugged directly into the motherboard and using AMD\u2019s integrated graphics engine.\n\nNow that my system has all its specs put on the floor, let\u2019s take a look at the games that I tested on the 7800 XT. I have played a handful of low- and high-demanding titles which include World of Warcraft, Forza Horizon 5, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Elden Ring, Armored Core 6, Halo Master Chief Collection, Balder\u2019s Gate 3, and Cyberpunk 2077. What I have found in each game is rather interesting but I\u2019d like to really focus on a couple of titles to keep this whole thing a bit more condensed.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\nI\u2019m actually massively surprised by how well the 7800 XT was able to handle this game at max graphics. With smooth fidelity, I found myself having to take occasional breaks because the game just ran too smooth. In some instances I did find a fair share of jagged lines and stair casing, but after playing around with some of the internal anti-aliasing effects, I was able to get a much deeper and cleaner view.\nA common theme with most games running on AMD hardware is toying around with the settings as a lot of the games I did play suffered from this slight stair casing effect. Call of Duty\u2019s guns looked smooth and the amount of blurring effects were minimal. I got a nice, clear picture on my display, but some of the backgrounds just really stood out with the jagged edges. That was until I fixed a core issue caused by AMD\u2019s drivers.\n\nPrior to that fix, I found myself having a blast while maintaining a really high frame rate around 120 fps. Smooth frame rates during first person shooters are so incredibly important, and I am glad to see that the PC optimization team really did a great job ensuring this game ran smooth even if the drivers weren\u2019t fully up to date.\nAfter I had everything properly updated, Call of Duty ran even smoother. The jagged edges were gone and the details started to really pop. If you have anything remotely shiny, that really showed off well here. The enhanced smoothness and visual effects really popped off the screen with high-quality details. Rocks looked rocky, blood looked bloody, and enemies looked pretty good while they blasted me in the face.\nIn one of the best rounds I have ever played in the franchise, I ran around this Greek-themed seaside village and was able to make out the extreme details found even with my camera whipping around trying to aim at the two dudes who happened to walk into my peripheral vision.\n\nAiming down sights and taking one out with an SMG and quickly swapping to my pistol to finish off the other in a rare double-kill scenario did something to my brain that made me forget all about my core focus here- which was assessing the game on a visual standpoint to a point that gamers would care about. Funny enough\u2014when you have some great moments in games like this, quality begins to slip into the back of your mind. In that instance, I was happier knowing that I performed a bit above my own abilities. This happened a handful of times within the round, coming close to a triple kill. I was quickly ego-checked by my inevitable death, which is just a part of the cycle, but I digress.\nWhat Call of Duty did suffer from was the amount of shader loading that would occur within the menus. As the saying goes, \u201cwith great resolutions comes great loading sequences,\u201d as I found myself staring at a packed screen, waiting for a percentage tracker to finish clocking down. Downloading these shaders also caused a performance hit, and while I appreciate them loading in the background, it can easily cause stuttering or other performance hits. For a twitch shooter, this is absolutely not a great side-effect of playing this game on PC.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3\nI don\u2019t think I could go much further without gladly mentioning my favorite game of 2023- Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. On the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, the game looked amazing. It took some tweaking, but the 7800 XT absolutely knocked the performance aspect out of the park- for the most part. I was actually quite impressed with the performance here speaking that Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 could run a bit rough even on consoles.\n\nFrame rates stuck around the 60 fps mark which is fine for most people as this isn\u2019t a twitch shooter. It is a tactical, slower paced game that focuses on character design and development, so it is key that the finer details within clothing and other artifacts maintains a smooth look. I can gladly say, it works well. Armor and shadows have a fine, smooth edge with realistic color reflections that look incredibly spectacular.\n\u00a0\nIn busy areas such as the city of Baldur\u2019s Gate, the 7800 XT was able to keep up with the events occurring around it. I didn\u2019t have to turn down the graphics to make Astarion\u2019s hair look like a cotton ball on a tip, something I had to do on the Steam Deck. I was able to turn everything up to the max, which made everything stand out. I rarely experienced any sort of slow-down that I didn\u2019t experience with the 3070 Ti.\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077\nCyberpunk 2077 is a massive game to say the least. I\u2019m honestly surprised it even made it on the Xbox One and PS4 generation of consoles. With max settings, Cyberpunk is one of the most demanding games ever released. NVIDIA uses this game to measure the performance of all their graphics cards, but AMD is also able to squeeze ample performance out of this title.\nEven on NVIDA graphics cards, I was pushing 60 fps smoothly. When I tried to raise the refresh rate, I started running into a few performance issues, which is understandable for the type of game this is. Other than that, I didn\u2019t experience the same issues I had with Call of Duty when it comes to stair-casing objects.\n\nI did notice at first without FSR, the quality of the lighting effects was rather low. Overhanging streetlights in particular showed the weakness in stock performance. After playing around with plenty of the settings, I was able to obtain a clearer picture. It took a while, but I was able to capture some of the best screenshots ever when I fine-tuned the GPU\u2019s overclock settings from a global default \u201cpower save\u201d mode to a full-out \u201chyper\u201d mode which optimized every game I loaded up. Once again, cities are not the easiest thing to render and somehow Cyberpunk 2077 was able to graphically perform up to my own personal bar.\n\nHalo Infinite\nI decided to jump into this game because it is one of Microsoft\u2019s flagship titles that seems to work incredibly well and is designed around AMD architecture. While it is nice and convenient, it does suffer from the one persistent issue that I have seen with a handful of games, which I will talk about later. Aside from that issue, Halo Infinite ran surprisingly smooth. It maintained a 60+ frame rate and was able to handle light illuminating effects rather well. Shadows seemed fine, and most of all, it provided a crisp detail.\nMuch like Call of Duty, I found myself running around these highly-detailed maps and taking in each environment. The more advanced looking facilities mixed with the rough exterior terrain didn\u2019t present any issue when running between the two. Some larger arenas didn\u2019t suffer from the type of texture pop-in as I expected, usually an effect of low draw distance. Halo Infinite looked real solid and performed well above my expectations once I got around that one persistent issue.\n\nAfter a few rounds, I once again let my mind shut-down as I fully engrossed myself in the gameplay of Halo Infinite. Once again, after I was able to wrap up the technical issues I was experiencing, I fully embraced what 343 Studios was able to deliver on a technical level. Granted, I didn\u2019t get a chance to try out the forge mode, I am interesting in leveraging the various effects and capabilities of that engine and manipulate lighting to create darker and more dreadful looking environments. For now, death-match and firefight would have to do.\n\nRundown\nThere are a few games I wanted tot talk about in greater detail but there is no real reason to. Games like Final Fantasy 14 and World of Warcraft are designed to run on any sort of machine. While Final Fantasy 14 can get a bit rough when you get into major cities on really low-end systems, it still maintains ample performance when you get away from the clutter. World of Warcraft runs so well on anything that I am surprised we haven\u2019t seen it run on a mobile device natively.\nForza Horizon 5 is a rough game to test because it ran so well on Xbox Series X to me that it is almost a 1:1 experience. Aside from the ultra-wide monitor, I didn\u2019t see much difference in performance with the 7800 XT with high to ultra settings. The thing with Forza is how the detail really comes out when you\u2019re sitting still. In the race, it all comes down to your immediate surroundings which looked great. The only issue rises when you have a graphics card with 8GB of VRAM as Forza really maximizes all that memory and warns you that you\u2019re reaching maximum utilization.\n\nWhen it comes to FROMSOFTWARE and their PC support, it could be better. Both Armored Core 6 and Elden Ring both look good. Details in Armored Core 6 look great and it offers a real smooth experience, and while Elden Ring does look good too it does suffer from an odd dip in frame rates which happen randomly and has caused several deaths in my latest runs. Also, Elden Ring only supports a 16:9 aspect ratio, giving me the dreaded black bars on my monitor. Not ideal, but it runs smooth.\n\nThe Issues\nNow, I\u2019ll admit, the grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side of the technological fence. While AMD is great, there is an odd situation I discovered when starting up some graphically demanding games for the first time and that is the initial poor performance.\nI know that the 7800 XT can handle almost everything I have thrown at it, as proven, but in some cases the game fails to load above 30 fps or even 10 fps. After changing settings and restarting my games, it finally evens out. Halo Infinite and Palworld are both titles that were affected by this. Call of Duty also takes a huge in-menu performance hit for some reason while the in-game performance is great, which is a real head-scratcher for me. People want to slam on titles for having \u201cbad UI\u201d haven\u2019t seen how archaic Call of Duty\u2019s can get\u2014 an article for another time.\n\nI\u2019ll also reiterate the fact that AI-infused resolution scaling with FSR isn\u2019t perfect nor is the ray tracing. They don\u2019t really come close to what NVIDIA is able to provide on their platform, but when you have a graphics card that is as powerful as the 7800 XT or anything above a 4080, you don\u2019t really need to use those technologies all that much as these cards can support these games natively. As for ray tracing as a stand-alone tech, I don\u2019t personally use it, even on the NVIDIA graphics cards as it can reduce general performance of your games.\n\nConclusion\nBuying the right graphics card is a difficult decision because there is so much to consider and the more information you absorb, the more difficult it is to make a choice. Folks could easily feel like they are choosing the wrong card and experience a type of buyers remorse.\n\nAs of January 2024, the Steam Hardware Survey results have NVIDIA taking up the first ten spots with the most powerful card being a 4060 Ti Laptop Graphics sitting at 2.5%, which should already tell you everything you need about the way games are going. Pair this with the 1080p resolution result sitting at 59%, it should start to make sense, or get the gears turning at the very least. You don\u2019t need the latest or greatest to enjoy PC gaming, but if you want some extra power behind your setup or plan on leveraging 1440p gaming, with ample VRAM, you can grab yourself an AMD RX 7800 XT for around $520 USD, right around the price of a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X when it isn\u2019t on sale. If you want to laugh, there are more people using Intel and AMD integrated graphics then there are folks using any high-end graphics card currently out in the market.\nPC gaming can get fickle at times but that is what makes PC gaming fun to me. I like tuning my games and playing around with settings. Some folks do not enjoy it and that is fine. Knowing that most games can easily handle high and ultra graphics settings is a joy to me, and if you are looking to jump into the world of PC gaming, hopefully tinkering around will be a joy to you too.\nShare:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading... \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBy Steve Esposito\nSteve Esposito is a dedicated content creator with a focus on his love for technology, video games, and the very industry that oversees it all.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Boston-based writer, speaker, and advisor on innovation and change.Follow AuthorFeb 21, 2024, 11:44am ESTShareSaveCommentI am a great admirer of Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, since I first spoke with him eight or nine years ago. In that call, he described how he was placing a long-term bet on 5 distinct end-markets that he believed needed his firms capabilities to reach their full potential. I described this approach in my book Corporate Explorer as a classic case of defining \u201chunting zones,\u201d to set boundaries for exploratory innovation.\n\nI was doing the call for a project on the future of the semiconductor industry. On the call was my client\u2019s strategy team and its chief financial officer . I vividly remember that as we closed the call, the CFO made a sarcastic comment about how Jensen talked a good game, but that the stock was in the toilet. He dismissed Jensen\u2019s decision to spend 30% of revenue on R&D as ill-disciplined innovation. At the time, Nvidia\u2019s stock was in the low $20 range, today it is close to $700, a 1500% increase over ten years.\n\n\nNvidia has been around for thirty years and Huang is quick to point out that it has transformed itself several times. This latest, defining transformation was from being the world\u2019s best maker of graphic processing chips for computer gamers. As Intel moved to incorporate graphic capabilities into its core processors, so Nvidia shifted tack and Huang defined his hunting zones. At the core of many was Artificial Intelligence and his conviction that his company\u2019s GPUs offered a tremendous advantage over alternatives.\n\nThe brilliance of Huang\u2019s approach is that he did not simply rush off and start developing new products. He understood that if he was going to displace Intel and the CPU from its dominance, he needed to build an ecosystem of developers that would adopt GPUs for AI applications. He motivated his engineers to go out and learn about scientific applications of AI, so that they could identify early adopters. Here Nvidia could leverage the brand relationships they had from computer gaming because so many of the people writing software for scientific discovery were gamers.\n\n\nNow, Nvidia is riding high on the boom in Artificial Intelligence. It has reached a new moment in its transformation. As it prepares for its 4Q earnings call it is the dominant player. It is no longer demonstrating progress on the route to becoming a major player in an emerging market. Nvidia is now the poster child for THE growth topic of the century so far.\nI am eager to see where Jensen Huang will go next. This last transformation was from a position of weakness, he was being pulled into an \u201cIntel Blackhole.\u201d Now, he is at a place of extraordinary strength can he reinvent Nvidia again to lead a new wave of growth? Will Nvidia meeting the notoriously short-term expectations of the market or will it start to creak under the weight of its own success?\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes Accolades\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The chipmaker has been seeing soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence, or AI applications. The company\u2019s revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. It\u2019s the latest sign that the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence likely won\u2019t subside anytime soon. Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here\u2019s a look:$273 billionThe amount Nvidia Corp.\u2019s market value increased on Thursday alone, according to FactSet. The previous record one-day jump was Meta Platform\u2019s gain of $205 billion on Feb. 2 of this year. In other words, Nvidia\u2019s one-day gain is more than the total market values of market stalwarts Bank of America ($265 billion) and Coca-Cola ($263 billion). In all, just 26 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 have market caps above $273 billion, including Nvidia. \n\n$1.915 TrillionNvidia\u2019s total market value as of the close of trading Thursday. It recently passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.051 trillion) and Apple ($2.845 trillion). The company was valued at around $580 billion a year ago.\n$60.9 billionRevenue for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28, more than double Nvidia\u2019s revenue for 2022 and about 6 times what it was five years ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia\u2019s revenue to top $100 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48.8%That\u2019s Nvidia\u2019s net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, almost 50 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple\u2019s net margin is 25.3% and Microsoft\u2019s is 34.1%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration guts board of US Institute of Peace.

Up an incredible 239% in 2023, it has continued to climb more than 45% so far in 2024 already. Investors aren't averse to paying a high premium for the stock given the potential that the company possesses.\nFor long-term investors, it's hard not to like Nvidia's growth prospects. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a huge opportunity for the business and its chips, which could prove to be essential for companies developing their own AI models and chatbots.\nBut there's a big concern that I see as the stock continues to rise, and one that could derail its progress: The expectations may be far too high.\nNvidia's PEG ratio suggests the stock is cheap\nNvidia's stock trades at nearly 100 times its trailing earnings. Even if you base it on the company's estimated future profits, the multiple is still a bit high at around 36. What investors can turn to in order to help normalize the company's earnings multiple is the price-to-earnings-growth ratio, or PEG.\nThe PEG multiple takes the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and divides it by the expected earnings growth for the business over the next five years. Nvidia's PEG ratio is less than 1, which implies that it's a good deal. If the PEG multiple is below 1, that indicates the company is expanding at a fast rate and the current P/E multiple may be justified, and that the stock is even cheap given the company's future growth prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow bullish is too bullish for Nvidia?\nThe problem with this conclusion, however, is that it depends heavily on analyst earnings estimates. According to analysts' expectations and data collected from Yahoo! Finance, Nvidia's growth rate will average 95% annually for five years. What this means is that if you believe Nvidia can double its revenue for five consecutive years, then yes, it's a good buy even at a P/E multiple of close to 100. The problem with that is it can create an extremely high bar for the company to have to hit.\nNvidia's growth rate has been more than doubling, however, and so it isn't outlandish to believe that it could maintain that high of a rate next year.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\nBut how Nvidia will do in three or four years is more debatable. Previously, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned that people were effectively \"begging to be disappointed\" with AI's capabilities. If that turns out to be true, the risk is that the level of investment in AI that analysts and investors expect could way off base. And any drop in demand could make Nvidia's expensive stock vulnerable to a sell-off.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you invest in Nvidia's stock despite its high price?\nNvidia is a promising stock to own because it is a leading supplier of AI chips. But at its extremely elevated price tag, it's not a stock I would buy today. If you're willing to hang on for several years, it could still be a good buy. But with expectations set so high, there's a fair amount of risk starting to creep into the stock, which could set it up for a correction in the future.\nInvestors may want to consider buying other AI stocks that can provide them with potentially more upside.\n\n\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The two companies developed architecture to accelerate the model\u2019s performance running in Nvidia data centers, in cloud and on GPU-enhanced PCs,\u00a0the announcement said.\nInitial stock of Nvidia\u2019s H200 processors are set to ship later this year, Kress confirmed, but the company expects supply won\u2019t satisfy demand for the new chips.\n\u201cWith all of the new products, demand is greater than supply,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThat's just kind of the nature of new products.

These household names were among the top gainers in the Nasdaq Composite in 2023, pulling the tech-heavy index out of its slump and generating gains of 43% last year. The storied index now sits less than 1% below a new all-time high, which will check the final box signaling the onset of a new bull market.  Here's how the collective performed in 2023: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 239% Meta Platforms: Up 194% Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): Up 102% Amazon: Up 81% Alphabet: Up 58% Microsoft: Up 57% Apple: Up 48%  Despite these market-beating performances, some market watchers believe there's more to come. In fact, a duo of Wall Street analysts suggest that two of these stocks still have upside potential of 78% and 80% over the coming year.   Image source: Getty Images.   Magnificent Seven buy No. 1: Nvidia 78% implied upside There's a strong argument that 2023 was the year generative artificial intelligence (AI) came of age, and strong adoption of these next-generation algorithms helped fuel last year's market recovery. Of all the Magnificent Seven companies, one has demonstrated its ability to profit most from this secular tailwind: Nvidia. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that create lifelike images in video games, revolutionizing the industry. The innovation that made this possible was parallel processing. Simply put, these chips have the ability to process a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking up the job into smaller, more manageable pieces. Parallel processing solved the workload problem for machine learning, an established branch of AI, and Nvidia quickly became the gold standard for AI applications. When generative AI burst on the scene last year, Nvidia adapted its processors for the next generation of AI.  The company just delivered its third consecutive record quarter and expects its triple-digit growth to continue. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ending April 30), Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $24 billion, an increase of 234% year over year. The company was clear this runaway train is being driven by the rapid and accelerating adoption of generative AI. Despite a stock price surge of 441% since the beginning of last year, some believe there's more to come. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann is the self-professed \"most bullish analyst on Nvidia.\" The analyst recently reiterated his buy rating on the stock while boosting his price target of $1,400, suggesting Nvidia could soar another 78% from here. The analyst justified the move by saying \"We are in the very early innings of what we call the Mother of All Cycles.\"   Story Continues The analyst has previously echoed CEO Jensen Huang's assertion that AI will be the catalyst for a long-awaited upgrade cycle in data centers. With an installed base worth $1 trillion, this represents a massive opportunity for Nvidia, which controls an estimated 95% share of the market for GPUs deployed in data centers.While the bears suggest Nvidia is expensive, I'd respectfully say that view is myopic, as the most commonly used valuation metrics don't factor in the company's triple-digit growth. Nvidia trades at a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock. By that metric, it's the least expensive of all the Magnificent Seven stocks.Magnificent Seven buy No. 2: Tesla80% implied upsideAfter a banner year in 2023, some investors have soured on Tesla. Yet the company achieved a number of remarkable milestones last year that suggest there's more to come. For example, the Model Y -- the company's most popular vehicle -- drove circles around the competition, becoming the world's best-selling car, according to online industry publication Motor1. In fact, Tesla was the first electric vehicle to ever top the list.Tesla has consistently stated that its long-term goal is to increase vehicle production by a compound annual growth rate of 50%, but astute investors realize there will be ups and downs. Tesla's outlook for 2024 suggests it's in the down part of a cycle.Management suggested that growth in 2024 \"may be notably lower\" than last year, saying that car sales are \"currently between two major growth waves.\" The resulting shareholder defections sent the stock tumbling.Despite the company's near-term prospects, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas continues to be Tesla's biggest cheerleader, assigning a Street-high price target of $345 while maintaining an overweight (buy) rating on the stock. This suggests potential gains for investors of 80%, compared to Friday's closing price. He wrote that Tesla's forecast included \"almost no\" new information and management wasn't clear concerning what \"notably lower\" implies.In a separate note, Jonas cited a survey suggesting that Tesla bears outnumber bulls by two to one, which highlights the \"seemingly overwhelming bearish institutional investor sentiment.\" He argues investors shouldn't view Tesla merely as a car company but as one with exposure to energy, AI, robotics, and more.Given the company's success at revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry and track record of confounding critics, I think it would be foolhardy to count Tesla out now.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, it is also worth noting that Nvidia has a Street-high price target of $1,100, which points toward a 61% upside from current levels within the next year. But can Nvidia get close to that mark and hit a stock price of $1,000, which would be a gain of only 47%? And if it can, then how fast? Let's find out.\nBig tech results point toward hot demand for Nvidia's AI chips\nMajor technology companies have been lining up to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train large language models (LLMs). The company's flagship H100 data center GPU is being scooped up by multiple customers ranging from Meta Platforms to Amazon to Microsoft to Alphabet, creating a shortage of these chips that may take between 36 weeks and 52 weeks to deliver.\n\nThese tech giants are looking to ramp up their spending on AI hardware, as their latest earnings calls and reports indicate. Meta Platforms, for instance, increased its 2024 capital expenditure forecast by $2 billion to a range of $30 billion to $37 billion. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the increased investment \"will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware.\"\nMeta's 2023 capital expenditure stood at $28 billion. And, there is a good chance that a nice chunk of the increased capex will be directed toward Nvidia's H100 processors, as per CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft management also remarked on the latest earnings call that it expects \"capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure.\" Meanwhile, Amazon management also remarked that it sees capital expenditure levels increasing in 2024, \"driven by increased infrastructure capex, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models.\"\nHowever, these tech giants aren't the only ones after Nvidia's AI chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang remarked in an interview with Bloomberg Television that many countries, such as Japan, Canada, France, and India, are looking to invest in AI infrastructure.\nMeanwhile, the company is also looking for ways to supply its chips in China and remain on the right side of the U.S. government's restrictions at the same time. The company is reportedly taking preorders for the H20 AI processor and other chips, which have been specially designed for the Chinese market.\nIn all, there are indications that the demand for Nvidia's AI processors could continue to improve in 2024. Not surprisingly, Nvidia has been looking to significantly improve the supply of its flagship processor in 2024, as a result of which it could generate $50 billion in revenue from the sales of this chip this year. That's why it is not surprising to see analysts anticipating a solid jump in Nvidia's revenue in fiscal 2025 (which has just begun).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow soon is $1,000 coming up?\nAnalysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to increase 58% in fiscal 2025 to $93.4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings are anticipated to jump from $12.30 per share in the previous fiscal year to $20.80 in the current one. The company is expected to sustain its healthy growth in fiscal 2026 as well.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead data by YCharts\nNvidia is currently trading at 37 times sales and 90 times trailing earnings. However, if we assume that it trades at a discounted 25 times sales at the end of fiscal 2026 thanks to its solid top-line growth and achieves $109 billion in revenue, its market cap could increase to $2.72 trillion. That would be a 67% jump from current levels.\nSo, based on Nvidia's current stock price of around $660 and the potential upside that it could deliver on the back of its impressive growth, its shares could be worth $1,000 apiece in the next couple of years. That's why investors should consider buying this AI stock right now, especially considering the cheap forward multiples it is trading at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Thurs post NVDA results,\" the analysts wrote.\u00a0\n\n\nNvidia sent investors into a frenzy with its earnings last Thursday, adding $267 billion in market cap, good for the biggest-ever addition to market value in a single trading session.\u00a0\n\"Despite the 'good vibes' last week and strong NVDA earnings on Wed, the NDX has traded lower 4 of the last 5 sessions, as price action and activity levels have started to show some more 2-way action to it, raising some tension about the sustainability of momentum from here,\" Peter Callahan, tech, media, and telecom sector specialist, wrote in the note.\u00a0\nHedge fund investors have shifted their focus to other high-quality stocks, with cash redirected from the tech trade to real estate, consumer staples, and materials, the note said.\u00a0\n\n\nThe analysts said that as the Magnificent Seven wrapped up their earnings season, their performance should begin to yield to broader economic indicators such as inflation data, as well as shifts in the Fed's rate-cutting timelines.\nThat said, market confidence in tech stocks remains robust, with Nvidia alone driving 22% of the S&P 500's weekly gain last week. The put-call skew, a key measure of investor fear, was down, while retail trading in Nvidia also surged to the 99.96th percentile in the one-week average notional amount traded over the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks\n\n\nTech stocks\n\n\nHedge Funds\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Nvidia\u2019s market cap has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2023, with its stock rising by 239% in 2023 and an additional 41% in 2024.\nSee Also: Surging Against The Odds \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s Astounding 41% Growth In 2024 Amidst Global Challenges\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s economic struggles have led to a significant drop in stock prices. The Hang Seng index, a key indicator for Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, has fallen by 26% over the past year and 8% year-to-date.\nWhy It Matters: Despite its remarkable growth, some experts have expressed concerns about Nvidia\u2019s valuation. Aswath Damodaran, often referred to as the \u201cDean of Valuation,\u201d earlier stated that Nvidia\u2019s stock is \u201cpriced to the point of insanity.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, other analysts have a more optimistic view of Nvidia\u2019s future. Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, previously reiterated an Overweight rating on Nvidia and increased his price target to $750, citing the company\u2019s strong near-term results and unique valuation.\nMoreover, Nvidia\u2019s recent partnership with Cisco Systems to expand AI technology in the corporate sector has further bolstered its position as the most valuable chipmaker globally.\nAnalysts are optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s future growth potential, with Vivek Arya of Bank of America predicting a significant upside in the company\u2019s quarterly earnings, driven by AI innovations and the upcoming B100 accelerator launch.\nRead Next: Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4090 Graphics Card Frenzy: Supply Crisis Hits Hard Amid Global Demand Surge and US Sanctions\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto via Shutterstock.NVDANVIDIA Corp$116.63-2.43%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.  So far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves. Shares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter. Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud. And while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market\u2019s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech\u2019s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons. AI is still king If you need more proof that Wall Street\u2019s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off. UBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company\u2019s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI\u2019s growth is proof Azure is seeing a \u201cflow-through of AI demand\u201d\u2019 and a return on capital expenditures.   China troubles: Apple CEO Tim Cook in New York City, (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)  \u00b7 REUTERS / Reuters Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft\u2019s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers. \u201cCopilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,\u201d Ives wrote in a note. Microsoft wasn\u2019t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.   Story Continues Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company\u2019s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company\u2019s AI moves and investments.\u201cIf we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,\u201d Zuckerberg said during his company\u2019s earnings call.  World-class AI assistants? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Photo: REUTERS/Carlos Barria)  \u00b7 Reuters / ReutersIntel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they\u2019re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,\u201d Cook said during the call.\"I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,\" he later added in response to an analyst's question.We\u2019ll likely learn more about Apple\u2019s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.There\u2019s no replacement for fundamentalsWhile AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.Alphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.While both companies beat analysts\u2019 expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.  Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo FinanceApple, meanwhile, reported better-than-anticipated earnings and revenue, as well as iPhone sales, but the company\u2019s stock took a hit on news that sales in China not only missed expectations but also fell year over year as well.While analysts didn\u2019t seem too concerned about the slowdown in sales in Apple\u2019s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, investors clearly were, as shares went south after the report.Nvidia will be the last of the Big Tech companies to report its earnings, on Feb. 21. Expectations for the company are sky-high after it posted better-than-anticipated earnings in the prior quarter. And if it manages to beat with strong AI sales, it\u2019ll prove both of this earnings season\u2019s lessons true.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

It's safe to say that the semiconductor bellwether passed with flying colors as the demand for its graphics cards and processors remains robust.\nThe stakes were high as Nvidia's shares have shot up an enormous 240% in the past year, so it needed to convincingly beat Wall Street's expectations and prove that AI is more than just hype. A closer look at the results of other big tech companies leading up to Nvidia's quarterly report indicated that it was well placed to crush analysts' expectations.\nLet's see how Nvidia fared last quarter and check how much upside investors can expect from this AI stock over the next three years.\nNvidia's stunning AI-driven growth is here to stay\nNvidia reported record fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $22.1 billion, a massive increase of 265% from the prior-year period and well ahead of the company's original guidance of $20 billion. What's more, the company's Q4 revenue accelerated at a faster pace than the 206% year-over-year jump it recorded in the fiscal third quarter, indicating that the demand for its chips is increasing. Meanwhile, the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up a whopping 486% year over year to $5.16 per share.\n\nConsensus estimates were anticipating Nvidia would deliver $4.60 per share in adjusted earnings on revenue of $20.4 billion. The company exceeded expectations by a mile. Also, the company's full-year revenue was up an impressive 126% year over year to $61 billion, while earnings shot up 288% to $12.96 per share. Nvidia witnessed a substantial jump in its non-GAAP gross margin to 73.8% last fiscal year as compared to 59.2% in fiscal 2023, which is a testament to the outstanding pricing power Nvidia enjoys in AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven better, the company's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 suggests that its tremendous growth is here to stay. Nvidia anticipates $24 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range, which means that it expects its top line to more than triple from the prior-year period's figure of $7.2 billion. Wall Street would have been satisfied with fiscal Q1 revenue of $21.9 billion.\nIt predicts that the non-GAAP gross margin will land between 76.3% and 77%. That would be a big jump as compared to the year-ago period's reading of 66.8%, suggesting that Nvidia's bottom line is set for robust growth once again.\nThe reason why Nvidia is all set to sustain its stunning growth is simple -- the booming demand for its AI chips that are deployed in data centers. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang pointed out in the company's earnings release that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" Third-party estimates indicate the same, with Future Market Insights predicting that the AI chip market could grow tenfold in revenue over the next decade and generate $287 billion in revenue in 2034.\nNvidia is already making the most of this opportunity. Its data center revenue shot up 409% year over year last quarter to $18.4 billion as the demand for its flagship H100 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) remained solid. For the full year, Nvidia's data center revenue reached a record $47.5 billion, an increase of 217% over the prior year. This segment produced 79% of the company's top line last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Gartner's estimate that the AI chip market generated $53 billion in revenue last year, Nvidia's full-year data center revenue indicates that it controlled nearly 90% of this space in 2023. The research firm estimates that global AI chip revenue could hit almost $120 billion in 2027. Assuming Nvidia can maintain its dominance in this market -- which it seems capable of thanks to an aggressive product roadmap -- its data center revenue could increase to $108 billion in the next three years.\nThrow in the other catalysts that Nvidia is sitting on, such as the adoption of generative AI in personal computers (PCs) that is fueling the growth of its gaming business, and it is easy to see why analysts have significantly raised their growth forecasts and are expecting it to sustain its elevated levels of growth going forward.\nHow much upside can investors expect over the next three years?\nAnalysts are forecasting Nvidia's revenue to increase 80% in fiscal 2025 to almost $110 billion, followed by further gains in the next two fiscal years.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's revenue is expected to touch almost $150 billion in fiscal 2027. That would be nearly 2.5 times the company's revenue in the previous fiscal year. Nvidia is currently trading at 32 times sales, which is significantly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 18. The premium valuation is justified, considering the company's terrific growth. The company's forward sales multiple of 18, however, is in line with the five-year average.\nAssuming Nvidia trades at 18 times sales after three years and hits $150 billion in revenue, its market cap could jump to $2.7 trillion, a jump of 37% from current levels. However, this AI stock is likely to deliver much stronger gains if the market continues to reward it with a premium valuation. So, a sales multiple of 30 could elevate its market cap to $4.5 trillion in three years, which would be more than double the current levels.\nThat's why investors would do well to continue holding Nvidia stock since it could keep heading higher over the next three years.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Since the start of 2023, shares of Supermicro (as it is commonly known) have vaulted 709% while Nvidia stock has jumped 374%.  Up until a recent surge by Supermicro, the two stocks have followed a similar path.\n\n^SPX data by YCharts\nBoth Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have been great stocks to own so far, but it's worth asking which is the better one to own today. To answer that question, we asked two of our contributors to pitch their pick of the two. First, we hear the Nvidia case.\nNvidia is an AI leader at an affordable valuation\nParkev Tatevosian (Nvidia): Arguably, no company benefits as much from the rising effectiveness of artificial intelligence as Nvidia. Revenue and profits are soaring for the maker of graphic processing units (GPUs). Unsurprisingly, the stock price has followed suit, but even though the market price has increased, Nvidia's valuation is still attractive for investors looking to capitalize on the AI wave.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia's revenue jumped by 102% and 206% in its two most recent quarters from the respective quarters of the prior year. That can be primarily attributed to increased demand from enterprises and institutions looking to implement AI technology in their processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, the increase in sales has fueled a similar increase in profit for Nvidia. Operating income exploded to $6.8 billion and $10.4 billion in the two most recent quarters. Of course, a profit surge of this magnitude will attract competitors, but Nvidia is arguably at least one, perhaps two, steps ahead of its rivals. \n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\nTo make the investment case more compelling, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27, a relatively low price for a business with such excellent prospects. Investors can do worse than adding Nvidia stocks to their buying list.\nThe \"next Nvidia\" could be a better choice\nJeremy Bowman (Super Micro Computer): In many ways, Super Micro Computer is shaping up to be the next Nvidia. The company makes advanced servers and storage equipment that are well-suited to handle the kind of intense workloads that AI applications like ChatGPT demand. Supermicro works closely with Nvidia, and its hardware is built using Nvidia chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between the two stocks was reinforced again on Monday, when both stocks rose as Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Nvidia. While there wasn't a comment on Supermicro specifically, the analyst did note signs that AI server demand was strong and GPU supply was improving, which is good news for Supermicro. \nNvidia stock rose 5% on the news, but Supermicro jumped 14%. Those comments also indicate that Supermicro's business could be starting to experience the kind of breakout Nvidia saw last year. Improving GPU supply could also mean that Supermicro will beat its guidance for the year, as that was based in part on supply chain constraints.\n\nFinally, Supermicro also has the advantage of being significantly smaller than Nvidia, meaning it's easier for the stock to be a multi-bagger from here. Nvidia currently trades at a market cap of $1.7 trillion, compared with $37 billion for Supermicro. It's not unreasonable for a $37 billion stock to double, but for Nvidia to double would mean it would become the most valuable company in the world. That's not an impossible task, but it's not as easy as going from $37 billion to $74 billion in size.\nBoth stocks look like great choices in the AI revolution, but Super Micro Computer has more long-term upside potential than Nvidia and looks like a good bet to surge later in the year as GPU supply loosens up and it can fulfill more demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Bowman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

But it's not a new act. The stock is up an even more impressive 87,000% over its lifetime.\nA true millionaire maker.\nToday, at a humungous $1.5 trillion market cap, it probably won't continue multiplying in size. After all, America's entire annual economic output is worth $28 trillion. But that doesn't mean Nvidia still can't help you retire a millionaire.\nInvestors can confidently buy and hold Nvidia in a diversified portfolio and enjoy the compounding returns that are likely on the way.\nI'll discuss how Nvidia can still change your financial fortunes below.\nAI is here to stay, but keep expectations realistic\nNvidia built a tremendous company by specializing in dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs). These are computer chips designed for intense workloads like high-end gaming. As technology advanced over time and demanded higher-performing hardware, Nvidia's chips began spreading to new end markets like cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving, and, yes, artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has become the dominant AI chip supplier in short order. Nvidia built a software ecosystem that made it easy for customers to implement and develop AI models on Nvidia chips. Today, Nvidia has an estimated 90% market share, and it's believed the AI chip market could grow to sizes ranging from $120 billion to $400 billion by 2027 (and could keep growing beyond that).\nRegardless of where the numbers ultimately land, AI is clearly a tremendous opportunity. As the dominant chip company, Nvidia could technically capture much of that growth, but investors may want to pump the brakes. There is no doubt Nvidia will remain a significant factor in AI, but competition will aggressively chase it. Additionally, some more prominent AI chip users could design in-house hardware; some are already working on it.\nThe bottom line is that Nvidia will continue growing, but it's unlikely that Nvidia will maintain its recent pace.\nA cash cow is born\nThe good news is that's OK. Nvidia doesn't need to become some $10 trillion company to make you extremely wealthy over the long term. It's just going to happen differently than investors are used to. You see, Nvidia is already highly profitable, and its tremendous revenue growth is making it a cash cow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nNvidia has converted 39% of its revenue to free cash flow over the past four quarters, totaling $17.5 billion. Analysts currently estimate $109 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2026. Cash flow margins could improve as Nvidia grows, but that's still about $40 billion in cash flow even if they don't.\nPutting that cash to work will make millionaires\nWhere am I going with this? There's a good chance that Nvidia's massive cash flow and what it does with that money will drive investment returns over the next decade and beyond. Shareholders could see Nvidia's profits trickle down to them as dividends and share repurchases. The company already pays a dividend, though its yield is hilariously low at 0.03% because of how much shares have risen.\nShareholders will be too giddy to laugh if management raises the dividend faster. The dividend only costs Nvidia about $394 million, a rounding error to the company today. I'm more optimistic that Nvidia will turn into a cannibal, repurchasing staggeringly large amounts of stock to boost its earnings-per-share (EPS) as revenue growth eventually slows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nYou can see that management recently began pressing this button, so investors could be at the beginning of a long stretch where repurchases lower the share count, making yours worth more.\nNvidia is too big to be the lottery ticket it once was. But is Nvidia capable of helping you retire a millionaire? Absolutely.\n\n\n\nJustin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Industries can use AI to quickly analyze vast bodies of data, allowing them to derive meaningful insights, make predictions and automate processes for greater efficiency.\nIn the public sector, government agencies are achieving superior disaster preparedness. Biomedical researchers are bringing novel drugs to market faster. Telecommunications providers are building more energy-efficient networks. Manufacturers are trimming emissions from product design, development and manufacturing processes. Hollywood studios are creating impressive visual effects at a fraction of the cost and time. Robots are being deployed on important missions to help preserve the Earth. And investment advisors are running more trade scenarios to optimize portfolios.\nEighty-two percent of companies surveyed are already using or exploring AI, and 84% report that they\u2019re increasing investments in data and AI initiatives. Any organization that delays AI implementation risks missing out on new efficiency gains and becoming obsolete.\nHowever, AI workloads are computationally demanding, and legacy computing systems are ill-equipped for the development and deployment of AI. CPU-based compute requires linear growth in power input to meet the increased processing needs of AI and data-heavy workloads. If data centers are using carbon-based energy, it\u2019s impossible for enterprises to innovate using AI while controlling greenhouse gas emissions and meeting sustainability commitments. Plus, many countries are introducing tougher regulations to enforce data center carbon reporting.\nAccelerated computing \u2014 the use of GPUs and special hardware, software and parallel computing techniques \u2014 has exponentially improved the performance and energy efficiency of data centers.\nBelow, read more on how industries are using energy-efficient computing to scale AI, improve products and services, and reduce emissions and operational costs.\nThe Public Sector Drives Research, Delivers Improved Citizen Services\u00a0\nData is playing an increasingly important role in government services, including for public health and disease surveillance, scientific research, social security administration, and extreme-weather monitoring and management. These operations require platforms and systems that can handle large volumes of data, provide real-time data access, and ensure data quality and accuracy.\nBut many government agencies rely on legacy systems that are difficult to maintain, don\u2019t efficiently integrate with modern technologies and consume excessive energy. To handle increasingly demanding workloads while sticking to sustainability goals, government agencies and public organizations must adopt more efficient computing solutions.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is making inroads in this endeavor. The department runs the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center for open science. NERSC develops simulations, data analytics and machine learning solutions to accelerate scientific discovery through computation. Seeking new computing efficiencies, the center measured results across four of its key high performance computing and AI applications. It clocked how fast the applications ran, as well as how much energy they consumed using CPU-only versus GPU-accelerated nodes on Perlmutter, one of the world\u2019s largest supercomputers.\nAt performance parity, a GPU-accelerated cluster consumes 588 less megawatt hours per month, representing a 5x improvement in energy efficiency. By running the same workload on GPUs rather than CPU-only instances, researchers could save millions of dollars per month. These gains mean that the 8,000+ researchers using NERSC computing infrastructure can perform more experiments on important use cases, like studying subatomic interactions to uncover new green energy sources, developing 3D maps of the universe and bolstering a broad range of innovations in materials science and quantum physics.\nGovernments help protect citizens from adverse weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, blizzards and heat waves. With GPU deployments, climate models, like the IFS model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, can run up to 24x faster while reducing annual energy usage by up to 127 gigawatt hours compared to CPU-only systems. As extreme-weather events occur with greater frequency and, often, with little warning, meteorology centers can use accelerated computing to generate more accurate, timely forecasts that improve readiness and response.\nBy adopting more efficient computing systems, governments can save costs while equipping researchers with the tools they need for scientific discoveries to improve climate modeling and forecasting, as well as deliver superior services in public health, disaster relief and more.\nDrug Discovery Researchers Conduct Virtual Screenings, Generate New Proteins at Light Speed\nDrug development has always been a time-consuming process that involves innumerable calculations and thousands of experiments to screen new compounds. To develop novel medications, the binding properties of small molecules must be tested against protein targets, a cumbersome task required for up to billions of compounds \u2014 which translates to billions of CPU hours and hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\nHighly accurate AI models can now predict protein structures, generate small molecules, predict protein-ligand binding and perform virtual screening.\nResearchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Scripps Research have shown that screening a dataset of billions of compounds against a protein, which has traditionally taken years, can now be completed in just hours with accelerated computing. By running AutoDock, a molecular-modeling simulation software, on a supercomputer with more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs, ORNL screened more than 25,000 molecules per second and evaluated the docking of 1 billion compounds in less than 12 hours. This is a speedup of more than 50x compared with running AutoDock on CPUs.\nIambic, an AI platform for drug discovery, has developed an approach combining quantum chemistry and AI that calculates quantum-accurate molecular-binding energies and forces at a fraction of the computational expense of traditional methods. These energies and forces can power molecular-dynamics simulations at unprecedented speed and accuracy. With its OrbNet model, Iambic uses a graph transformer to power quantum-mechanical operators that represent chemical structures. The company is using the technology to identify drug molecules that could deactivate proteins linked to certain cancer types.\nAs the number of new drug approvals declines and research and development and computing costs rise, optimizing drug discovery with accelerated computing can help control energy expenditures while creating a far-reaching impact on medical research, treatments and patient outcomes.\nTelcos Scale Network Capacity\nTo connect their subscribers, telecommunications companies send data across sprawling networks of cell towers, fiber-optic cables and wireless signals. In the U.S., AT&T\u2019s network connects more than 100 million users from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Florida Keys, processing 500 petabytes of data per day. As telcos add compute-intensive workloads like AI and user plane function (UPF) to process and route data over 5G networks, power consumption costs are skyrocketing.\nAT&T processes trillions of data rows to support field technician dispatch operations, generate performance reports and power mobile connectivity. To process data faster, AT&T tested the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark. By spreading work across nodes in a cluster, the software processed 2.8 trillion rows of information \u2014 a month\u2019s worth of mobile data \u2014 in just five hours. That\u2019s 3.3x faster at 60% lower cost than any prior test.\nOther telcos are saving energy by offloading networking and security tasks to SmartNICs and data processing units (DPUs) to reduce server power consumption. Ericsson, a leading telecommunications equipment manufacturer, tested a 5G UPF on servers with and without network offload to an NVIDIA ConnectX-6 Dx NIC. At maximum network traffic, the network offloading provided 23% power savings. The study also found that CPU micro-sleeps and frequency scaling \u2014 allowing CPUs to sleep and slow their clock frequencies during low workload levels \u2014 saved more than 10% of power per CPU.\nHardware-accelerated networking offloads like these allow telco operators to increase network capacity without a proportional increase in energy consumption, ensuring that networks can scale to handle increased demand and conserve energy during times of low use. By adopting energy-efficient accelerated computing, telco operators can reduce their carbon footprint, improve scalability and lower operational costs.\nManufacturing and Product Design Teams Achieve Faster, Cleaner Simulations\nMany industries rely on computational fluid dynamics during design and engineering processes to model fluid flows, combustion, heat transfer and aeroacoustics. The aerospace and automotive industries use CFD to model vehicle aerodynamics, and the energy and environmental industries use it to optimize fluid-particle refining systems and model reactions, wind-farm air flow and hydro-plant water flow.\nTraditional CFD methods are compute-intensive, using nearly 25 billion CPU core hours annually, and consume massive amounts of energy. This is a major obstacle for industrial companies looking to reduce carbon emissions and achieve net zero. Parallel computing with GPUs is making a difference.\nAnsys, an engineering simulation company, is speeding up CFD physics models with GPUs to help customers drastically reduce emissions while improving the aerodynamics of vehicles. To measure computing efficiency, the company ran the benchmark DrivAer model, used for optimizing vehicle geometry, on different CPU and GPU configurations using its Fluent fluid-simulation software. Results showed that a single GPU achieved more than 5x greater performance than a cluster with 80 CPU cores. With eight GPUs, the simulation experienced more than a 30x speedup. And a server with six GPUs reduced power consumption 4x compared with a high performance computing CPU cluster delivering the same performance.\nCPFD offers GPU parallelization for Barracuda Virtual Reactor, a physics-based engineering software package capable of predicting fluid, particulate-solid, thermal and chemically reacting behavior in fluidized bed reactors and other fluid-particle systems.\nUsing CPFD\u2019s Barracuda software, green energy supplier ThermoChem Recovery International (TRI) developed technology that converts municipal solid waste and woody biomass into jet fuel. Since its partnership with CPFD began 14 years ago, TRI has benefitted from 1,500x model speedups as CPFD moved its code from CPU hardware to full GPU parallelization. With these exponential speedups, models that would\u2019ve previously taken years to run can now be completed in a day or less, saving millions of dollars in data center infrastructure and energy costs.\nWith GPU parallelization and energy-efficient architectures, industrial design processes that rely on CFD can benefit from dramatically faster simulations while achieving significant energy savings.\nMedia and Entertainment Boost Rendering\nRendering visual effects (VFX) and stylized animations consumes nearly 10 billion CPU core hours per year in the media and entertainment industry. A single animated film can require over 50,000 CPU cores working for more than 300 million hours. Enabling this necessitates a large space for data centers, climate control and computing \u2014 all of which result in substantial expenditures and a sizable carbon footprint.\nAccelerated computing offers a more energy-efficient way to produce VFX and animation, enabling studios to iterate faster and compress production times.\nStudios like Wylie Co., known for visuals in the Oscar-winning film Dune and in HBO and Netflix features, are adopting GPU-powered rendering to improve performance and save energy. After migrating to GPU rendering, Wylie Co. realized a 24x performance boost over CPUs.\nImage Engine, a VFX company involved in creating Marvel Entertainment movies and Star Wars-based television shows, observed a 25x performance improvement by using GPUs for rendering.\nGPUs can increase performance up to 46x while reducing energy consumption by 10x and capital expenses by 6x. With accelerated computing, the media and entertainment industry has the potential to save a staggering $900 million in hardware acquisition costs worldwide and conserve 215 gigawatt hours of energy that would have been consumed by CPU-based render farms. Such a shift would lead to substantial cost savings and significant reductions in the industry\u2019s environmental impact.\nRobotics Developers Extend Battery Life for Important Missions\u00a0\nWith edge AI and supercomputing now available using compact modules, demand for robots is surging for use in factory logistics, sales showrooms, urban delivery services and even ocean exploration. Mobile robot shipments are expected to climb from 549,000 units last year to 3 million by 2030, with revenue forecast to jump from more than $24 billion to $111 billion in the same period, according to ABI Research.\nMost robots are battery-operated and rely on an array of lidar sensors and cameras for navigation. Robots communicate with edge servers or clouds for mission dispatch and require high throughput due to diverse sets of camera sensors as well as low latency for real-time decision-making. These factors necessitate energy-efficient onboard computing.\nAccelerated edge computing can be optimized to decode images, process video and analyze lidar data to enable robot navigation of unstructured environments. This allows developers to build and deploy more energy-efficient machines that can remain in service for longer without needing to charge.\nThe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Autonomous Robotics and Perception Laboratory (WARPLab) and MIT are using the NVIDIA Jetson Orin platform for energy-efficient edge AI and robotics to power an autonomous underwater vehicle to study coral reefs.\nThe AUV, named CUREE, for Curious Underwater Robot for Ecosystem Exploration, gathers visual, audio and other environmental data to help understand the human impact on reefs and sea life. With 25% of the vehicle\u2019s power needed for data collection, energy efficiency is a must. With Jetson Orin, CUREE constructs 3D models of reefs, tracks marine organisms and plant life, and autonomously navigates and gathers data. The AUV\u2019s onboard energy-efficient computing also powers convolutional neural networks that enhance underwater vision by reducing backscatter and correcting colors. This enables CUREE to transmit clear images to scientists, facilitating fish detection and reef analysis.\nDriverless smart tractors with energy-efficient edge computing are now available to help farmers with automation and data analysis. The Founder Series MK-V tractors, designed by NVIDIA Inception member Monarch Tractor, combine electrification, automation and data analysis to help farmers reduce their carbon footprint, improve field safety and streamline farming operations. Using onboard AI video analytics, the tractor can traverse rows of crops, enabling it to navigate even in remote areas without connectivity or GPS.\nThe MK-V tractor produces zero emissions and is estimated to save farmers $2,600 annually compared to diesel tractors. The tractor\u2019s AI data analysis advises farmers on how to reduce the use of expensive, harmful herbicides that deplete the soil. Decreasing the volume of chemicals is a win all around, empowering farmers to protect the quality of soil, reduce herbicide expenditures and deliver more naturally cultivated produce to consumers.\nAs energy-efficient edge computing becomes more accessible to enable AI, expect to see growing use cases for mobile robots that can navigate complex environments, make split-second decisions, interact with humans and safely perform difficult tasks with precision.\nFinancial Services Use Data to Inform Investment Decisions\u00a0\nFinancial services is an incredibly data-intensive industry. Bankers and asset managers pursuing the best results for investors rely on AI algorithms to churn through terabytes of unstructured data from economic indicators, earnings reports, news articles, and disparate environmental, social and governance metrics to generate market insight that inform investments. Plus, financial services companies must comb through network data and transactions to prevent fraud and protect accounts.\nNVIDIA and Dell Technologies are optimizing computing for financial workloads to achieve higher throughput, speed and capacity with greater energy efficiency. The Strategic Technology Analysis Center, an organization dedicated to technology discovery and assessment in the finance industry, recently tested the STAC-A2 benchmark tests on several computing stacks comprising CPU-only infrastructure and GPU-based infrastructure. The STAC-A2 benchmark is designed by quants and technologists to measure the performance, scalability, quality and resource efficiency of technology stacks running market-risk analysis for derivatives.\nWhen testing the STAC-A2 options pricing benchmark, the Dell PowerEdge server with NVIDIA GPUs performed 16x faster and 3x more energy efficiently than a CPU-only system for the same workload. This enables investment advisors to integrate larger bodies of data into derivatives risk-analysis calculations, enabling more data-driven decisions without increasing computing time or energy requirements.\nPayPal, which was looking to deploy a new fraud-detection system to operate 24/7, worldwide and in real time to protect customer transactions, realized CPU-only servers couldn\u2019t meet such computing requirements. Using NVIDIA GPUs for inference, PayPal improved real-time fraud detection by 10% and lowered server energy consumption by nearly 8x.\nWith accelerated computing, financial services organizations can run more iterations of investment scenarios, improve risk assessments and make more informed decisions for better investment results. Accelerated computing is the foundation for improving data throughput, reducing latency and optimizing energy usage to lower operating costs and achieve emissions goals.\nAn AI Future With Energy-Efficient Computing\nWith energy-efficient computing, enterprises can reduce data center costs and their carbon footprint while scaling AI initiatives and data workloads to stay competitive.\nThe NVIDIA accelerated computing platform offers a comprehensive suite of energy-efficient hardware and software to help enterprises use AI to drive innovation and efficiency without the need for equivalent growth in energy consumption.\nWith more than 100 frameworks, pretrained models and development tools optimized for GPUs, NVIDIA AI Enterprise accelerates the entire AI journey, from data preparation and model training to inference and scalable deployment. By getting their AI into production faster, businesses can significantly reduce overall power consumption.\nWith the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark, which is included with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, data analytics workloads can be completed 6x faster, translating to 5x savings on infrastructure and 6x less power used for the same amount of work. For a typical enterprise, this means 10 gigawatt hours less energy consumed compared with running jobs without GPU acceleration.\nNVIDIA BlueField DPUs bring greater energy efficiency to data centers by offloading and accelerating data processing, networking and security tasks from the main CPU infrastructure. By maximizing performance per watt, they can help enterprises slash server power consumption by up to 30%, saving millions in data center costs.\nAs businesses shift to a new paradigm of AI-driven results, energy-efficient accelerated computing is helping organizations deliver on the promise of AI while controlling costs, maintaining sustainable practices and ensuring they can keep up with the pace of innovation.\nLearn how accelerated computing can help organizations achieve both AI goals and carbon-footprint objectives. \n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Data Center | Hardware | Networking | Robotics | Software | SupercomputingTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Embedded Computing | Energy | Financial Services | GPU | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Industrial and Manufacturing | Inference | Jetson | Machine Learning | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA BlueField | RAPIDS | Social Impact | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Those who bought and held shares many years back are very wealthy today.\nBut thinking that you've missed the boat because you were late can be a costly mistake. You could have invested $10,000 in Nvidia just five years ago and still be sitting on $195,000 in gains today.\nNobody knew five years ago that artificial intelligence (AI) would impact Nvidia as it has, but that's the thing with great companies -- fortune tends to find them.\u00a0The cycle repeats. There are investors right now thinking they've missed out on Nvidia. But as you'll see below, that's not necessarily true.\nHere is why.\nNvidia is cornering the AI chip market\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market. It's become widely known how the company jumped out to a quick lead, illustrated by exploding growth that began several quarters ago. Industry analysts estimate that Nvidia's early market share is between 80% and 95%. The technology sector's most prominent companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta Platforms, flocked to the company's flagship H100 and H200 series AI chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts. YoY = year over year. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nNaturally, these companies, which are buying tens and hundreds of thousands of chips, may try to develop their own chips to save money and optimize their hardware for their own use. It looks like Nvidia is staying proactive here, which should be music to investors' ears.\nAccording to a report by Reuters, Nvidia will establish a new business unit for custom AI chips. As companies look for alternatives to Nvidia's standardized AI chips, it potentially opens the door for competitors that can help create these custom chip designs. Nvidia's custom chip unit will try to prevent market share leakage by working with customers looking for alternatives to Nvidia's standardized chip products. Custom chips are predicted to be a $30 billion niche in the AI chip space.\nCould Nvidia still be cheap?\nThings can move fast in the stock market. Nvidia, which trades at over $720 per share, was only $200 a year ago. As you saw in the graph above, the company's growth spurt justified Nvidia's meteoric rise. However, investors must carefully weigh Nvidia stock's future potential versus its price tag.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the calendar turns over, Nvidia's stock is pricing in the next fiscal year's earnings. Shares trade roughly 35 times its estimated earnings for the year ending January 2025. Remarkably, analysts' long-term growth estimates signal the stock is still arguably cheap on a forward-looking basis. That's a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio under 1.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. PE = price to earnings. EPS LT = earnings per share long term.\nOn the other hand, analysts have set a very high bar, and coming up short could cause a painful contraction in the stock price. In other words, the stock is a riskier investment today than a year ago because expectations are higher.\nHow investors should approach Nvidia stock\n\nTime is a superpower for individual investors who don't need to meet quarterly performance quotas for their clients like hedge fund managers do. Naturally, a stock that has risen as much as Nvidia could easily see a pullback. But given the overwhelming evidence of Nvidia's AI dominance, now and moving forward, it may be unwise to avoid the stock altogether, holding out for a price that may never come.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why investors should dollar-cost average into Nvidia stock. Buying a little at a time will help investors build a position at various price points, automatically averaging down if the stock does take a fall. Plus, holding Nvidia with a multiyear time frame in mind will increase the odds that investors realize the company's long-term growth as investment returns.\nIt's much easier to imagine Nvidia being a much bigger company 10 years from now than to guess Nvidia's quarterly results and the market's reaction to them. Playing the long game will help investors get more out of the stock, especially as Nvidia's new-found growth opens up potential share repurchases and dividend growth over the coming years.\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The startup, which counts Nvidia as an investor, is seeking to enable a new era of high-performance chips with silicon photonics technology that uses light to move data faster through chips than what\u2019s possible with electricity.\n\u201cWhile I remain extremely optimistic about the future of Ayar Labs, I couldn't be more excited about this rare opportunity at Nvidia,\u201d Wuischpard wrote in a LinkedIn post. \u201cThe company is playing a profound role at the intersection of AI, cloud, graphics, robotics, and automotive, with all the necessary pieces to truly transform the world as we know it.\u201d\nWuischpard is joining Nvidia as the company experiences astronomical growth due to high demand for its GPUs, which has been driven by a surge of interest in generative AI applications. For its third quarter, Nvidia reported that revenue had tripled from a year ago, and it expects to finish its 2024 fiscal year strong with even higher sales in the final three months.\nWhile Nvidia has dominated the AI computing space through an ever-expanding set of tightly integrated chips, systems, software and services, the company is facing a field of competitors who are eager to whittle away at its influence.\nNvidia\u2019s competition includes pure-play rivals like AMD, Intel and several startups as well as cloud service providers designing their own AI chips, such as Amazon Web Services.\nEven OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that has been a major Nvidia customer, has reportedly been interested in making its own AI chips.\nPrior to leading Ayar Labs, Wuischpard was an executive for more than four years at Intel, where he served as general manager of the Scalable Datacenter Solutions Group, which was sold to MiTAC, the Taiwan-based parent company of server vendor Tyan.\nPreviously, he was president and CEO of Fremont, Calif.-based high-performance computing systems integrator Penguin Computing for seven years.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) shot up nearly 3% on the heels of the chipmaker's results, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped about 2.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped almost 1.2%, or more than 400 points.  Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones closed at record highs on Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite closed just shy of a record high while the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose more than 3% to an all-time high. The last time the Nasdaq 100 moved more than 3% and hit a record high on the same day was in March of 2000, per Bespoke Investment Group. Stocks powered higher as Wall Street celebrated Nvidia's blowout quarterly results, which beat sky-high expectations. That reassured investors about the strength of the AI mania that has lifted US stock gauges to record highs. The chipmaker's CEO said generative AI has \"hit the tipping point\" as it reported a 265% rise in revenue and laid out very upbeat guidance, a sign demand for AI hardware is booming. Nvidia shares climbed about 16% to hit a record high. The stock added $277 billion to its market cap on Thursday, the largest single day increase ever. The bullish mood spread worldwide, with chip stock gains helping Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) index to finally beat a record that had stood since 1989. Similarly, techs boosted the pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) to a fresh all-time intraday high. Amid the ebullience, an assessment of the Fed's next move appeared to be on the back burner. The central bank's latest minutes showed most officials want to tread carefully on rate cuts, seeing risks in moving too quickly.

Fri, February 23, 2024 at 4:00 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Mortgage rates continue to climb in February Mortgage rates continued to press higher, according to new data released on Thursday.Yahoo Finance's Rebecca Chen reports:Mortgage rates climbed further above 7% this week, complicating the housing market with mixed signals on where home affordability will head next.The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan reached 7.16% on Thursday and has remained over the 7% threshold every day over the past seven days, according to Mortgage News Daily tracking. The latest average is the highest in two months, matching the highest level since late November.A separate index tracking the weekly average on a 30-year loan showed a similar story \u2014 the weekly average increased 12 basis points to 6.90% from 6.77% a week prior, according to Freddie Mac\u2019s latest release.So far in 2024, housing market activity remains slow but is expected to accelerate when rates drop. However, resilient economic data \u2014 strong labor market and consumer spending \u2014 will likely delay the rate cut that many were expecting earlier in the year. That would have a dampening effect on the normally busy spring homebuying season.\"The economy is creating jobs, but this mortgage rate is really hitting affordability limits for many households,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR), said Thursday. \"Certainly, they cannot get a mortgage outside of their budget. So it's not good news.\"    Fri, February 23, 2024 at 3:28 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Trending tickers on Thursday afternoon Rivian (RIVN) Automotive led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Thursday as shares fell more than 26%.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) touched new intraday record highs less than 30 minutes after the opening bell on Thursday. A slew of other companies that aren't AI focused, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Waste Management (WM), also touched fresh highs during the session.All of these moves higher come just a week after a hotter-than-expected inflation report spawned a mini-market sell-off and as Federal Reserve officials continue to indicate interest rate cuts are likely to come later than many hoped. Normally, those two headwinds are large enough to drive the market action. Not on Thursday.To Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel this resilience shown by the market amid major macro headwinds and high stock valuations has been simply \"impressive.\"\"FOMO operates on its own timetable, stocks can get more expensive, and the Momentum ends when it ends, which is often without warning,\" Emanuel said. \"FOMO, for now, Stays Bid.\"  Fri, February 23, 2024 at 1:43 AM GMT+8  Josh Schafer  Stocks at record highs amid Nvidia rally Stocks are poised for another record day as Nvidia euphoria proliferates through the broader markets.As of 12:40 p.m. ET, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) was up over 2.5% on the heels of the chipmaker's results, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 1.8%.

We right-sized manufacturing, took a big write-off, mostly non-cash, in the fall, and now I think we're off to the races. The objective this year ... is to increase vaccination rates,\" Bancel told Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani.Read more here.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Moderna, Inc.

Advanced Chart     Thu, February 22, 2024 at 9:07 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  It\u2019s pretty clear where Wall Street stands on Nvidia My Wednesday night of Nvidia analysis ended by seeing this comment on X, formerly known as Twitter, from my former boss Jim Cramer on one of his favorite all-time stocks Nvidia. (We would constantly talk about Nvidia in the TheStreet\u2019s office, going back to 2018.)\u201coh and if you bet against Nvidia please don't forget to send me an invitation to your funeral....,\u201d Cramer posted.Jim reminded me this morning via email that he named his dog Nvidia in 2017!I think this upbeat vibe is nicely captured in the actions by sell-side analysts on Nvidia this morning.There were price target raises across the board as Nvidia\u2019s quarter and guidance pushed the stock closer to the $800 mark. Interesting to see DA Davidson at a $620 price target, which is about 20% below current levels. Conversely, Bernstein\u2019s new $1,000 price target estimates a 30% upside for Nvidia\u2019s stock from current levels.Hat tip to @DeItaone on X for this helpful roundup:UBS cuts price target to $800 from $850 KeyBanc raises price target to $1,100 from $740 HSBC raises price target to $880 from $835 JPMorgan raises price target to $850 from $650 Stifel raises price target to $910 from $865 Deutsche Bank raises price target to $720 from $560 DA Davidson raises price target to $620 from $410 Cantor Fitzgerald raises price target to $900 from $775 Bernstein raises price target to $1,000 from $700 Wolfe Research raises price target to $900 from $630 Morgan Stanley raises price target to $795 from $750 BofA Securities raises price target to $925 from $800 Truist Securities raises price target to $911 from $691 Goldman Sachs raises price target to $875 from $800   Thu, February 22, 2024 at 8:32 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  Looking for other stories inside Nvidia At first glance, the story following Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) latest eye-popping earnings day is the financials themselves.To see this kind of growth at Nvidia\u2019s scale is crazy:Total sales: +265% vs last year Data Center: +409% vs last year Visualization: +105% vs last year The company\u2019s guidance was equally impressive.But once the shock and awe wears off, I think you will see the Street dig in on Nvidia and really try to determine how this company is growing in 2025 and 2026. There has been some chatter on the Street this morning that Nvidia may start to see a sharp growth slowdown next year as Big Tech companies such as Microsoft rein in their AI spending after two heavy years of investment.To that emerging debate, I offer up this key point from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy.Roy didn\u2019t shoot down the notion of Nvidia\u2019s growth miracle cooling next year but contended they won\u2019t fall off a cliff because of the work the company is doing to diversify its revenue base.Says Roy:\u201cAs questions regarding the sustainability of Nvidia\u2019s growth increase, we found management commentary on revenue diversification notable. In addition to continued growth of Networking and Software, Nvidia\u2019s overall Data Center revenue is increasingly diversifying across industries and regions, including a growing contribution from demand related to sovereign AI deployments. This diversification, in our view, is likely to continue as AI-related ROI for end users accelerates. \"Nvidia continues to believe that the migration from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents a $1 trillion opportunity, longer term. As the AI Factory concept materializes, management believes that another $1 trillion opportunity could follow.Back to marveling at Nvidia\u2019s numbers\u2026 for now.

Jim Cramer recently said in his program \"Mad Money\" on CNBC that people are asking him which stock would be the next NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Cramer said people believe Nvidia has \"made it\" since the stock has gained 236% over the past one year. Cramer acknowledged that it's really \"hard\" to find another such company that can post such an \"unbelievable\" revenue growth. Cramer reiterated that AI could be the \"gamer changer\" for \"everything\" that is digital. \u00a0Cramer said NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the \"freak of nature\" and the stock's dramatic rise in value has been difficult to digest for many because in the past companies like Apple and Microsoft rose to dominance relatively slowly, but Nvidia's market cap ascendance was unheard of.  Cramer then went to discuss which companies could join the $1 trillion market cap club soon. Cramer yet again sounded bullish about Eli Lilly because of the company's weight loss drug and Alzheimer's treatment. Cramer said these weight loss drugs make junk food less appealing.\u00a0 Cramer also said Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment approval could come \"any day\" now. While Cramer believes Eli Lilly stock should see a sell-off in the near term, he thinks the company is headed to become the first $1 trillion market cap pharma company in the future.   Jim Cramer Was Right About These Stocks   Methodology In this article we decided to take a look at the performance of Jim Cramer's stock picks. For that we first referred to our previous articles in which we covered Cramer's stock recommendations and calls made near the end of 2023 and early 2024.\u00a0 We then calculated the performance of these stocks in 2024 so far to see whether Cramer was right or wrong about these stocks. With each stock we have mentioned its performance in 2024. Some top Jim Cramer's recommendations for 2024 were NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Let's see how they performed. Jim Cramer's Stock Predictions and Their Performance in 2024 10. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 13 Cramer's Recommendation: Sell YTD Performance in 2024: -17% Back in August 2023, when Cramer was asked about his thoughts on Rocket Lab USA Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RKLB) during a program on CNBC, he said that investing in Rocket Lab USA Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RKLB)\u00a0was like \u201csending your money up in smoke.\u201d   Story Continues Rocket Lab USA Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RKLB)\u00a0stock is down by about 17% year to date through February 26.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, \u00a013 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Rocket Lab USA Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RKLB). The most significant stake in Rocket Lab USA Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RKLB)\u00a0is owned by Jose Fernandez's Stepstone Group which owns a $45 million stake in Rocket Lab USA Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:RKLB).9. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 20Cramer's Recommendation: SellYTD Performance in 2024: -17%In July 2023, Jim Cramer was asked about Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS), the California-based solid state lithium metal batteries\u00a0company. Jim Cramer he would take a \"hard pass\" on the stock and there was \"nothing there\" about the stock.Over the past six months the stock is down by about 11%.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS).Earlier this month the company posted Q4 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at -$0.23, surpassing estimates by $0.01.8. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 22Cramer's Recommendation: BuyYTD Performance in 2024: +93%In early January, Jim Cramer had said that Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\u00a0was doing \"so much so right, they are going to dominate cell phone, PC, hyperscale.\"Cramer said he'd want to buy Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\u00a0for his charitable trust.Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\u00a0shares have gained about 93% year to date through February 26. However, apparently this performance has run too hot for Cramer. He earlier this month said Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\u00a0was an example of market \"froth.\"Like Arm Jim Cramer is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).7. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43Cramer's Recommendation: BuyYTD Performance in 2024: +22%Jim Cramer was bullish on Howmet Aerospace Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HWM)\u00a0when 2024 started. Here's what he had said about the aerospace engineering company when a caller asked him about this thoughts during a program on CNBC:\"What a stock Howmet is,\" Cramer said. Cramer had said that investing in Howmet Aerospace Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HWM)\u00a0was the \"right call.\"Howmet Aerospace Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HWM)\u00a0shares have gained about 22% since 2024 started.As of the end of the last quarter of 2023, \u00a043 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Howmet Aerospace Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HWM).The company talked about its guidance in Q4'2023 earnings call:\"Regarding the full year 2024, we see revenue at $7.1 billion plus or minus $100 million; EBITDA of $1.635 billion plus or minus $35 million; and earnings per share of $2.15 plus or minus $0.05. Free cash flow, we see a $735 million plus or minus $35 million and CapEx of $290 million plus or minus $15 million. I\u2019d like to comment further on the capital expenditures, seen as these are expected to be above depreciation for the first time in many years. Essentially, this is due to investment opportunities materializing the Engine Products business. We see this as a very good sign to be able to deploy capital with high returns and rapid future growth. In fact, let me expand. In fact, 2023, which was another year of above market growth in each of our segments, in fact, above 5% above market served. Read the entire earnings call transcript here.6.

Can It Continue?\n\n\n  \n      By Alex Carchidi\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      Feb 29, 2024 at 10:23AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia disclosed that it owns a small portion of Nano-X Imaging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNano-X could benefit significantly from teaming up with the chipmaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the relationship between the two players is ambiguous for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NNOX\n\nNano-X Imaging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$341M\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-1.89%)\u00a0-$0.11\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$5.72\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:49 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market is making a lot of assumptions, and some are likely false.\n\nAccording to a recent regulatory filing, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) now owns a stake in Nano-X Imaging (NNOX -1.89%), a small Israeli medical device company that makes X-ray machines. While the investment was modest, that didn't prevent investors from reacting ebulliently to the news -- Nano-X's shares skyrocketed more than 50% the following day.\nDoes Nvidia's involvement have the potential to be transformative for the smaller business, and is it possible that there's more upside in store for shareholders? Or is the market missing something?\n\nA collaboration could be big, if it actually exists\nIt's worth noting that Nvidia's shares of Nano-X are worth a grand total of $379,856, which is just a smidgen in comparison to its market cap of around $572 million. So at first glance, it looks like the market is massively overreacting since it's difficult to imagine precisely what the company could even do with such a small investment. Still, appreciating the context is key to understanding why the market isn't entirely over the top with its aggressive bidding.\nIn case you aren't familiar, Nano-X's business model is a bit unique. Rather than manufacture its low-cost X-ray machines and sell them to customers, it doles out hardware with the goal of capturing revenue each time a customer performs a scan. In the U.S., each scan costs on the order of $30, but it's likely cheaper elsewhere. The company has also decided to experiment with its model somewhat in the U.S., where it charges customers a small amount for equipment and installation as well as for scans.\nThe advantage of this model is that the business can access a much larger market -- many healthcare systems in developing countries and rural areas of the U.S. could certainly make use of an X-ray machine, but they often lack the capital to buy them.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing that its target customers are unlikely to have many spare radiologists if they don't already have basic imaging technology on hand, the company is also developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems and human-provided teleradiology services to remotely analyze the images generated by its hardware.\nThat could be one explanation for Nvidia's interest as the company is keen to invest in many different AI applications. Pairing Nvidia's acumen with AI together with Nano-X's widely distributed scanning hardware -- if that's what the two companies have in mind -- could thus be beneficial for both organizations, especially if it allows Nano-X to one day offer a product that eliminates the need for radiologists entirely. Neither company has made any comment.\nIn 2017, Nvidia invested in another Israeli company, Zebra Medical, which was focused on using AI for interpreting scan imagery. Then in 2021, Nano-X purchased Zebra Medical using its stock, so Nvidia received its shares. It's very possible that the only reason it reported its stake in February was that the size of its investment portfolio grew to be worth more than $100 million, which is the cutoff after which it'd be required to make a regulatory filing. \n\nConsider circling back in a few quarters\nNvidia is a powerful company, but it isn't yet a kingmaker, at least not in the medical device industry. It's true that Nano-X could stand to increase the size of its addressable market by bolstering its offerings with Nvidia's AI capabilities if that were to take place. But that elides a more significant issue for investors, namely that Nano-X has not proven its business model is actually viable.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Nanox.Arc, its x-ray platform, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), its commercial global launch has been much slower than anticipated. According to the Q3 report, its quarterly revenue of $2.5 million in 2023 was barely higher than 2022's haul of $2.4 million in the same quarter.\nWhat's more, $2.2 million of its third-quarter revenue was from its teleradiology services, as was all of its revenue a year prior. Only $99,000 was derived from equipment sales and installation fees. Likewise, while its AI solution for analyzing scans of people's livers has the stamp of regulatory approval, it has not driven faster revenue growth yet either.\nIn other words, this business is not yet profitable or self-sustaining, and so it is a risky investment. Without the core economic proposition validated -- that it can make more money on scans than it costs to produce and install the scanning hardware -- it's hard to be enthusiastic about investing.\nNonetheless, if over the next few quarters Nano-X's scan revenue growth starts to accelerate sharply -- and there is a good chance it will based on its growing sales force and recent agreements with medical device makers  -- shareholders who started a position will probably get wealthier.\n\n\n\nAlex Carchidi has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

When the artificial-intelligence (AI) chip giant announced fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings this week, it hit the ball out of the park.\nRevenue reached new records, advancing in the triple digits in the quarter and for the year. And net income also climbed in the triple digits for both periods.\nAll of this is thanks to the company's dominance in the AI chip market. It has an 80% share, and demand is increasing for its products. Nvidia's stock has reflected this, advancing more than 270% over the past year.\nBut one element in Nvidia's earnings report left a mark on the otherwise pristine picture -- the drop in Nvidia's data center revenue in China, a country that's accounted for 20% to 25% of its data center revenue in recent quarters. Should you worry about the decline?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nU.S. ban on chip exports to China\nIt's important to consider the reason for this movement, which has to do with a U.S. ban starting late last year on high-performance chips to China and other countries considered a security threat. When the U.S. announced the move, it cited the potential for China to use the chips to produce \"advanced military systems,\" such as weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo comply with the ban, Nvidia stopped exporting its top-performing chips to China. As a result, data center sales to the country dropped \"significantly\" in the fourth quarter, when the country represented a mid-single-digit percentage of data center revenue. The company expects China data center revenue to make up about the same percentage of revenue in the current quarter, too.\nWhat is Nvidia doing to address the situation? The technology giant is introducing alternative chips -- products that don't require a special license from the U.S. -- to the Chinese market. The company says it's now testing its new offering in the marketplace and aims to do its best to compete within the limits of the U.S. legislation.\nThe big risk for Nvidia is that local competitors will produce chips superior to what the American company is authorized to export to China -- and that could derail its sales there. Chinese customers may not want the slower chips at all or may accept them for a time -- until they're able to access more powerful chips at home.\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said during the recent earnings call that after the end of this new quarter, \"[H]opefully we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecord data center revenue\nLet's get back to our question: Should you worry about a drop in China revenue persisting and hurting Nvidia's growth prospects? And the answer is, not necessarily.\nTwo reasons prompt me to say this. First, data center revenue climbed across all other geographies, resulting in triple-digit gains year over year to a record level of $18.4 billion. Even with revenue considerably lower in China, Nvidia's overall data center revenue still is soaring. If we imagine the worst-case scenario -- local chipmakers taking major market share -- other geographies have what it takes to drive major growth at Nvidia.\nSecond, when it comes to its competitiveness in China, Nvidia is just getting started with alternative products. As the company communicates with customers and learns how to navigate in the new environment, we may see stronger revenue down the road. And if we don't, as I mentioned, it may not be catastrophic for this high-growth AI player.\nWhat does this mean for you as an investor? It's important to keep an eye on how things evolve in China. It's still a key market, and if Nvidia can win over customers with its new offerings and increase its growth there, the company's already bright picture could get even brighter. But if China revenue remains lackluster, it doesn't mean disaster for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia remains a great buy today, thanks to its earnings gains in recent quarters and prospects in the high-growth area of AI.\n\n\n\nAdria Cimino has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

A decade ago, there were no companies with $1 trillion market caps -- the largest came in at around $500 billion. Now, there are six companies with 13-digit valuations in the U.S. \nPredicting a company's future becomes even more difficult when it's involved with an explosive trend such as artificial intelligence (AI). While there may be a risk of a bubble forming, significant business results disprove that view. Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%) is at the forefront of this discussion, as its products are critical in this area. However, the company saw a dramatic rise in its stock price, and there's now a lot of optimism baked into it.\nSo where will Nvidia be in a decade?\nNvidia's revenue skyrocketed in the past year\nNvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are the best-in-class hardware for supporting AI workloads. GPUs were originally made to provide the fast processing required by video game graphics, but their ability to efficiently handle intense calculations made them popular for running other workloads like drug discovery, engineering simulations, cryptocurrency mining, and now, AI model creation.\nInterest in AI grew rapidly in the past year and a half as businesses and consumers became intrigued by generative AI, and rising demand meant a need for supercomputers and server installations capable of processing these workloads. Fortunately for companies like Nvidia, these supercomputers must feature thousands of GPUs. Given that Nvidia's flagship H100 GPUs are rumored to cost around $30,000 apiece, that market is a significant revenue stream for it. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis new demand caused Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket over the past few quarters.\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nHowever, the growth is far from over. For the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 (which ended in late January), management guided for revenues of about $20 billion. When Nvidia reports its Q4 results on Feb. 21, all eyes will be on its next revenue guidance as investors seek assurance that it can continue growing at these incredible rates. That's because there are a lot of expectations baked into the stock price.\nThe stock may look expensive, but future earnings should make it cheaper\nMuch of Nvidia's rise is based on its anticipated future growth. The company's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is an absurdly high 95. However, when its forward earnings ratio (based on analysts' growth estimates) of 35 is considered, the stock doesn't look nearly as expensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts\nThat's not to say 35 times earnings is necessarily cheap, but when one considers, for example, that tech giant Microsoft trades for 36 times forward earnings, Nvidia's valuation doesn't seem so bad. \nBut the elephant in the room is that Nvidia is a hardware company. Unlike software, which is largely sold as a service and a regular subscription, hardware is usually a one-time purchase to be used until it's necessary to replace or upgrade. With the recent rush to build out AI computing infrastructure, there's been a significant diversion from the expected growth path of the GPU market.\nLate last year, Precedence Research (a market research firm) estimated the GPU market would have around $56 billion in revenue during 2023. If Nvidia hits its guidance for Q4, it will have produced revenues greater than that in just three quarters. Does that mean Precedence was wrong? Not necessarily. The market could be pulling forward some of the revenue predicted for future years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut another thing Precedence predicts is that there will be revenue of $773 billion in GPU sales by 2032. That's drastically higher than current sales and shows a massive market for GPUs that hasn't been tapped yet.\nSo, what will happen to Nvidia over the next decade? I'd predict a few things:\n\nNvidia's annual revenues will fall at some point because of initial demand fulfillment.\nRevenues will ramp up again once new GPU technology is invented or product demand increases.\n\n\nNow, I don't know when the first prediction will happen. Still, with many experts predicting GPU usage will only increase thanks to the rise of cloud computing and other data-driven approaches, it makes sense to buy shares of Nvidia, even if they are expensive.\nWhile Nvidia's stock will likely nosedive at some point, over the long term, the growth is there for it to be a market-crushing stock. You'll have to hold onto it through those difficult times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share. Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results.   Chkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: \"Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns.\" Speaking to Nvidia's dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: \"I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter.\" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: \"The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don't know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who's kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let's say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live. Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino Video Transcript JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk to one analyst who's watching these numbers closely. That is Antoine Chkaiban, who is New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst. Antoine, what do you make of these numbers as we just get them? It looks like a beat here but not the astonishing beats perhaps that we have had in some recent quarters. ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: Yes. Thanks, Julie, for having me. So Nvidia just printed 4Q topline, up 22% sequentially. That's 8% above sell side consensus expectations on top line, with data center revenues 27% above, and guided 1Q topline 9% sequentially, 8% above consensus expectations. And the stock has been moving a lot after market.   Story Continues   This clearly illustrates that buy side expectations were above sell side. And also, remember that this has to be put in context of a very strong acceleration in the past couple of quarters. Nvidia's topline had already grown 2 and 1/2x in 3Q compared to 1Q, as companies like Microsoft and Meta accelerate the deployment of their AI infrastructure. JOSH LIPTON: And, Antoine, I'm curious on the call here coming up with Jensen Huang as well as, of course, the CFO, what's your number one question, Antoine, for those executives?   ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: So I think just looking at the numbers in the press release, indeed, doesn't give us any indication on where we're headed. We're still very early in the broader deployment of AI. Demand is very strong at the moment. Supply is tight. And hopefully, Nvidia will give qualitative color on the call. The company made comments last quarter suggesting that visibility now extends in 2025 with inference picking up. That's the kind of color that we'll be on the lookout for. JULIE HYMAN: And I'm also curious what kind of trajectory you're looking for for the generative AI cycle, I guess, even though it feels still like we're very early. There was another analyst who talked about a replacement cycle of these GPU-- these Nvidia-provided GPU chips that could be as much a high percentage as 50% to 60% of chips from, I guess, around 10% right now. Does that-- I mean, you know, what are the estimates out there for how big this could eventually be? ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: But if we take a step a step back on all this, global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of 400 billion in 2027.   And so now we just need to think about the future along two axes, either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction with disappointments over investments and lower returns. And we really see three possible scenarios from here. First of all, if AMD's $400 billion in 2027 case materializes, well, Nvidia is still amongst the highest quality names to invest today. $400 billion spent on AI chips likely means at least $300 billion on GPUs. And Nvidia, the undisputable leader in this market, could generate $65 of EPS in 2027. That's more than two times above consensus. And that makes plenty of room for the stock to keep trending up. And then another scenario could be for AI to cool off and say only half of AMD's projection materializes. $200 billion spent on chips in 2027 means maybe $150 billion on GPUs. And Nvidia would generate closer to $30 of EPS, which is what consensus is currently modeling. Such a scenario would therefore make less room for upside as it's already priced into the stock.   And lastly, if AI adoption plays out much more slowly than what people currently expect, well, we could simply reach a peak in 2025 and realize that use cases are not mature enough to drive adoption. Spending would pull back in 2026, 2027, as the industry digests the chips deployed. And that is what we call an AI winter. And it's in such a scenario Nvidia would miss expectations and the stock would pull back. JOSH LIPTON: Antoine, stay right there. I want to bring in another-- another very smart analyst to give his commentary. Dan Morgan, Synovus Portfolio Manager, joins us now. Dan, it is great to have you in the conversation. We should mention, Dan, initially this stock in the after hours had dropped about 4%. You are now popping almost now above 6.5%. So investors digesting this and now initially at least seem to be responding very positively. Dan, want to get first your reaction and your response, Dan, to this report. DAN MORGAN: Well, Josh to me it looks like a beat across the board. I mean, the big numbers I was focusing on was data center in terms of revenues. They beat that handily. And then of, course, that upcoming first quarter of '25 revenue number, I think the Street was a little over $21 billion, that came in over $24 billion. So again, it really-- there is very hard to find any flaws in this report.   You know, Julie, Josh, coming into this I was worried that maybe even if they beat on the fourth quarter and guided ahead on the first quarter of '25, it still wouldn't be enough. So I'm encouraged that they are reacting positively to the stock. We had a big sell off, as you know, coming to this report. A lot of it is related to the Palo Alto Networks warning that we got last night that kind of rolled into the Nvidia number and Nvidia stock price. But it appears that we're getting some clear thought here on going forward with Nvidia. And it looks all positive. JULIE HYMAN: Just one thing I wanted to draw our viewers attention to that I've noticed in the CFO commentary from Colette Kress over at Nvidia, she mentioned that data center sales to China declined significantly in the fourth quarter due to US government licensing requirements. Now, that's not a surprise, right? We know that Nvidia is trying to figure out some workarounds for China. But, Antoine, I'll take this question back to you. How much of an obstacle still is China? And do you expect China to continue to? Will it get worse?   ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: So I think in the guidance actually for the quarter that Nvidia just reported, there were no data center revenues. Nvidia guided for very minimal data center revenues this quarter. And the way we see things playing out going forward is that demand is so strong everywhere in the world that chips that would have been allocated to China can definitely be reallocated to other countries to demand elsewhere. So we don't really see that weighting much on data center growth going forward. JOSH LIPTON: And, Dan, I want to bring you back here as well. I should mention, Dan, we think of Nvidia now as kind of an AI proxy, so maybe it's no surprise here, Dan. I'm looking at a few different names here moving higher, maybe in symphony, Supermicro, AMD, ARM, Palantir moving higher here in the after hours as well. One question I had for you, Dan, was on the question of competition, you know, in Gen AI Silicone. When you think of competition-- I guess I'll double barrel for you, Dan. One, what are, in your opinion, Nvidia's kind of competitive advantages? And two, who you think poses the greatest competitive risk? Is it AMD, Intel, or another player?   DAN MORGAN: Yeah, Josh. So I think we have to think of Nvidia as kind of first to market in AI. I mean, they have been talking about on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in this space. And then all of a sudden, it came to fruition about a year ago on this quarter. And they had the big blowout quarter. So they've got that lead post in terms of ahead of a lot of the competition. But you're right, Josh. I mean, I've done a lot of work in putting together tables and so forth of what are some of these competing chips. I mean, you have AMD which you mentioned. They have the MI300X, MI300A, which they have, rolling out right now in that space. You also have Intel with Falcon Shores, GOTY 3, which is another chip that's going to be coming out the next year or two. You look at Marvel Technologies. Their PAM4 DSP processor is also in that space. But there's no doubt that NVIDIA has that lead ahead of a lot of these other companies who are just now starting to roll out competing AI chips. So because of that, they're-- probably stay in the lead.   But think about this, Josh. The average AI chip that NVIDIA sells-- we don't know the exact price. But some of them are like, $20,000 or $30,000 a piece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD, who's kind of known as being a lower priced chip maker, especially in the CPU area against Intel, or let's say in the data server space, would they come in to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with? So that's where I kind of see the door maybe opening up for maybe an AMD or some other competing company, like a Marvel or something like that. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, that's an interesting question. I mean, Qualcomm has already also come out with some chips that it says are very speedy in the AI realm for smartphones. And I wonder-- part of what NVIDIA has done was, to some extent, commoditize what has been historically, at least, a commodity business, right, when you're talking about semiconductors and still is that way in many sectors of the business. Antoine, do we get to a point where even these AI chips are commoditized, where you see a price war that gets kicked off by an NVIDIA competitor, for example?   ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: I think creating, designing an AI chip is easier said than done. It requires so much R&D, so much experience to create a chip that's as flexible as an NVIDIA GPU today where you have compute units speaking to a hierarchy of memory that is so complicated so you can move data around without keeping parts of the chips that-- a chip that is very expensive, that costs $20,000, if not more, keeping all the parts of the chip busy at every point in time. It takes a lot of experience. It takes a lot of R&D. The ecosystem that NVIDIA has built, as well, all the software stack, all the ecosystem resources, the developers that can help each other-- that is not something that can be created overnight by a competing ecosystem, by another company. So I really don't think that we're headed towards a commodity market here. On the contrary, if anything, ecosystem dynamics will drive concentration. If we go back to this $400 billion time that AMD alluded to, we see GPUs accounting for at least 75% of that market because of the flexibility that they offer. And then we see NVIDIA remaining dominant within that $300 billion market if it materializes.   JULIE HYMAN: And I think Antoine brings up a good point, Dan, as well, about the sort of-- it's not just the chip that NVIDIA makes. It has the software. It has that-- what he called the ecosystem. So then do you play it not just by trying to find out who the competitors are going to be, but who are the service providers for NVIDIA, who is working with them to help them produce that ecosystem? DAN MORGAN: Yeah. I think what Antoine's alluding to is, Julie, is that NVIDIA has their own proprietary software that they sell along with their chips. Kind of going back to maybe issues in terms of possible threats that we could look at from an NVIDIA, especially the data center, it's projected about 65% of their revenue comes from data center AI chips. We know that-- companies just recently announced in the last couple of days. We know that Amazon, we know that Microsoft, we know that Alphabet, Meta are all working on their own AI chips to use in their own systems, which would take away that reliance that they would have on, let's say, an NVIDIA and maybe their willingness to spend $20,000 on a chip. So that's another interesting thing, Julie, to think about.   We think about the competition from AMD and Intel and Broadcom and Marvel. But it could be from the actual buyers that use the chip. They start developing their own interior proprietary chip, kind of like what Apple's done with the Mac and has moved over with their phones. They have their own chips now opposed to relying on outside vendors. So that's kind of something interesting to think about. JOSH LIPTON: Antoine, I'll get you out of here on this. I see the stock-- it is surging here in the after hours, up over 6%. One question I had for you, Antoine, is as you think about as a financial analyst, when you think about NVIDIA in the quarters, years ahead, is it going to be a kind of and bust company, Antoine, or No you think the kind of growth we're seeing here, which is obviously really impressing investors in the Street-- it can actually continue? ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: Well, we have been very, very busy over the last few months thinking about that question and putting together a framework to help us predict towards which scenario we're headed. You remember I just mentioned we could be headed towards a $400 billion scenario. We could be headed towards an AI winter. And I think we'll be monitoring four parameters to determine where we're headed.   First of all, we'll be monitoring how quickly model complexity is increasing. GPT-4 is likely five times larger than GPT-3. And we have been on this trend for many years now that's driving demand for more compute. Then you have cheap efficiency that's increasing, as well, of course. H100's throughput is six times higher than A100. And Moore's law and design improvements will keep driving higher throughput. That is offsetting model complexity increasing. And then you have usage, of course, users and the time that each user spends on ChatGPT, Gemini, et cetera. That is driving demand for more chips. And so this is what we'll be monitoring in coming years. This is how we can add value for investors, by carefully tracking how these three parameters-- model complexity, chip efficiency, and usage-- are growing. We can determine how much the AI install base needs to grow and how much the world will have to spend to build it. Those are really the leading indicators to determine if we're headed towards an AI winter or not.   JULIE HYMAN: Dan and Antoine, I have one final question that I want to ask both of you. Dan, I'll start with you. Right now, the stock is up. Obviously, it could do whatever in the next 24 hours. If it continues to rise, is it too late for investors, Dan, to get in here? DAN MORGAN: Julie, we've had NVIDIA on our buy list for a pretty long period of time, way before it became the hottest stock ever. And for investors that would possibly come in with new monies, it's on their buy list if the risk tolerance and the objective matches. The stock trades at about 83 times trailing earnings, trades about 35 times fiscal year 2025 earnings. So it's not excessive, Julie, when we look at the forward multiple. And I still think there's room to grow. I mean, I'm going to write a piece of our upcoming newsletter this month that talks about is NVIDIA the next Microsoft and Apple, meaning those two stocks have eclipsed $3 trillion. Microsoft just got over the fence. Could NVIDIA be the next $3 trillion stock-- so still very optimistic and very bullish. And I still think there's plenty of opportunity for investors. Obviously, try to catch it on a weaker day. But it's still-- fundamentals are still intact going forward. There's really nothing, I believe, to derail the story at this point.   JULIE HYMAN: Antoine, do you agree? ANTOINE CHKAIBAN: So I think I agree that there is still upside. I definitely think that there is still room for the stock to keep going up. And so I join Dan on this one. But I also think that there is probably more upside in other names, like AMD, for example. AMD probably has the most attractive profile, actually, with the most upside if this $400 billion time plays out because the market is going to grow so much. And AMD's revenues today in that time is-- are very small. And so there's plenty of room for AMD to beat expectations even more than NVIDIA. I also think other names, like TSMC, Intel, and Micron, probably offer less upside than AMD. But they're also a better way to play this with a safer approach. Even if the high case doesn't materialize, there is still upside in an AI winter scenario. So we look really at this space more holistically. And we think NVIDIA is one of the ways. But there are many other ways to play this trend. JULIE HYMAN: Gentlemen, thank you so much-- really great to have you on and get your insight instantly after these numbers. Dan Morgan and Antoine Chkaiban, thank you so much.  Terms   and Privacy Policy    Privacy Dashboard    More Info     Recommended Stories    We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now.

At the moment, nothing is garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks normally overseen by humans, has application across almost every sector and industry. This is likely why the analysts at PwC believe AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia has become the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution Over the past year, megacap Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the charge among artificial intelligence stocks. It's become the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains of high-compute data centers that allow for split-second decision-making by AI software and systems.  Since 2023 began, shares of Nvidia have nearly quintupled in value, with the company closing in on $1.5 trillion in added market cap, all thanks to AI. With enterprise demand particularly high for the company's AI-accelerated chips and supply still short, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power, which has driven most of its sales increase. But with Nvidia shares closing at $726 last week, the prospect of a stock split may begin to look all the more enticing. A \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major exchange, as with a reverse-stock split. Nvidia would be looking at its second forward split in the past three years. However, Nvidia isn't the only high-flying AI or AI-related stock that appears primed for a potential stock split. What follows are three AI companies that could beat this GPU juggernaut to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.   Image source: Getty Images.   Meta Platforms The first artificial intelligence stock that could beat Nvidia to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is none other than social media juggernaut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Meta has never conducted a stock split, but its share price climbed to near $490 this past week.   Story Continues Meta is using AI in a variety of ways across its various products. In addition to helping with search and weeding out noncompliant posts made on its social media platforms, it's leaning heavily on generative AI to help businesses tailor their ads to users.Many of the investments Meta is making in AI and virtual/augmented reality probably won't result in a sizable increase in sales for years. In the meantime, it continues to generate almost 98% of its revenue from advertising. The company's social media real estate, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads, is tops in the world, with nearly 4 billion collective monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Meta should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.Something else to note about Meta Platforms is that it's a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year, and it closed out 2023 with over $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This treasure chest is what allows CEO Mark Zuckerberg the luxury of taking risks, which includes the development of Meta's own AI chips.Super Micro ComputerA second AI-fueled company that can become Wall Street's next stock-split stock well ahead of Nvidia is server and storage-solutions specialist Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Like Meta Platforms, Super Micro has never conducted a stock split. However, with its stock briefly surpassing $1,000 per share last week, a forward split is probably in consideration.Super Micro Computer's more-than-doubling in sales this year is a function of its highly customizable and energy-efficient rack-scale servers being in high demand. It's also a reflection of the company relying on Nvidia's AI-powered GPUs in its products. Businesses wanting to harness AI to expand their long-term growth potential and reach are increasingly turning to Super Micro.What remains to be seen is if Super Micro Computer can hold onto its nearly exponential returns over the past couple of weeks. Shares ended the previous week up 183% on a year-to-date basis, and are up 878% since the start of 2023. Historically, every next-big-thing investment over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technologies or innovations. AI will likely share this fate.The other challenge for Super Micro is going to be whether or not it can maximize demand for its rack-scale solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro relies on Nvidia's GPUs, it's at the mercy of its suppliers. But if Super Micro can somehow meet or surpass Wall Street's already lofty growth expectations, a stock split could well be in the cards.BroadcomThe third artificial intelligence stock that could leapfrog Nvidia and become one of Wall Street's next stock-split stocks is semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Before Avago acquired Broadcom in 2016 and kept its name, Broadcom had completed three splits. But Avago had never split its stock. As of Feb. 16, a single share of Broadcom was setting shareholders back a whopping $1,245.Broadcom is approaching AI inclusion a couple of ways. It's added AI features to its Trident networking processors, and in April 2023 introduced its Jericho3-AI chip for AI networks. Jericho3 is integral for high-performance data centers in that it's designed to connect up to 32,000 GPUs. In short, it's designed to handle increasingly faster workloads in enterprise data centers.One factor that's definitely worked in Broadcom's favor is its juicy backlog. Although CEO Hock Tan failed to provide an update on Broadcom's backlog in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ends in late September), the company totaled a record backlog of $31 billion in mid-2022. Wall Street and investors love large backlogs, because it typically leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.But something investors should keep in mind is that Broadcom is generating a significant percentage of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. While this segment should continue to deliver modest growth and plenty of cash flow for Broadcom, it could, ultimately, hold back the company's overall growth rate given how large of a role it plays in net sales.With one of the highest nominal-dollar share prices on Wall Street, Broadcom is a logical candidate to split its stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

La Monica, InvestorPlace Contributor\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2024, 3:05 pm EDT\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 8, 2024\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing artificial about Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) parabolic stock market run. The chip giant, fueled by strong sales of AI-powered processors, has surged more than 40% already this year and is now worth a staggering $1.73 trillion. The stock is trading at a record high, having recently passed the $700 threshold. If Nvidia, which is due to report its latest earnings on Feb. 21, continues its impressive rally, the company will soon top two other tech giants in market value.\nNvidia is on the verge of passing both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is now worth $1.76 trillion, and Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has a market cap of $1.82 trillion. Saudi Aramco, which is valued at just under $2 trillion, is within Nvidia\u2019s reach as well.\nNvidia Is Racing to Take Amazon\u2019s Crown\nAfter that, the stock would have a ways to go before it catches Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which are each worth around $3 trillion. Still, Nvidia\u2019s potential ascension to becoming the third most valuable company on the planet would be an amazing milestone.\nThe question now for investors though is whether Nvidia shares may eventually run out of steam. After all, the stock has climbed more than 200% in just the past 12 months and has skyrocketed nearly 1,800% in the past five years. That type of appreciation is unsustainable. Even if you don\u2019t subscribe to the notion that what goes up must eventually come down, it seems reasonable to expect the pace of Nvidia\u2019s stock price appreciation to inevitably slow.\nBut when will that happen? Nvidia bulls still have much to cheer. The company is expected to report in a few weeks that its earnings per share more than quintupled in its fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts are forecasting a revenue surge of more than 200%. For the full fiscal 2024 year, sales are estimated to more than double. And Wall Street thinks revenue for fiscal 2025 will soar another 60% and that earnings will be up more than 70%.\nDespite this, Nvidia shares still trade at a reasonable (if not exactly dirt cheap) valuation of 33 times earnings estimates for its next fiscal year. And it\u2019s worth wondering if those fiscal 2025 earnings estimates are too low. The consensus earnings projection for next year has increased by nearly 25% over just the past three months. If Nvidia reports another blowout quarter on Feb. 21, analysts may have to frantically raise their forecasts again just to keep up.\nThe Bottom Line: NVDA Stock Forecast \nOf course, there is no guarantee that Nvidia will eclipse the market caps of Amazon and Alphabet anytime soon. Both of those companies have momentum as well, with each of them benefiting from AI investments too. But Nvidia is the quintessential Wall Street darling right now. Nearly all (34 out of 38) of the analysts that cover the company have Nvidia rated a buy.\nSure, there is the substantial risk that Nvidia is an increasingly crowded trade and that even the slightest miss on earnings or indication that profit growth won\u2019t live up to the considerable hype could send investors fleeing for the exits. Nvidia also must contend with increased competition in AI from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). But for the time being, Nvidia is the undisputed champion of the semiconductor industry.\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

[+] Bangladesh Kite Federation in the beach in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh on February 02, 2019.  (Photo by Mamunur Rashid/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\nIn recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing industries and driving unprecedented growth in companies at the forefront of innovation. Among these trailblazers are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Super Micro Computers (SMCI), two firms that have captured investors' attention with their remarkable performance. As the AI boom continues to unfold, investors are faced with the challenge of evaluating whether these stocks continue to present compelling investment opportunities or if the red-hot rally is poised for a cooldown.\n\n\nNVIDIA, the darling of AI and currently the third largest Mega Cap is +47% YTD and +18,000% (180X) since the end of 2013. Super Micro Computers, is +253% YTD and +6200% (62X) in the past 5 years. Comparisons are now being made to the dot.com bubble of 2000 with some analysts expecting a similar bust. Are things different this time? Yes.\n\nUnlike the dot.com bubble, AI stocks have revenues, profits and margin expansion. Notably, both NVDA and SMCI have been growing revenues and expanding margins while their peers are contracting. NVDA has doubled its EBITDA margin (from 26% to 50%) while growing revenues by nearly 60%. NVDA has been grabbing market share at the expense of its competitors in which their revenues have declined by -5%. Similarly, SMCI has grown revenues by nearly 40% while peers have contracted.\n\n\nThis suggests that it may not be appropriate or fair to compare AI companies, such as NVDA and SMCI, to the dot.com bubble. They are very unique organizations.\n\nHow different are they? NVDA and SMCI have distinguished themselves with extraordinary growth that have far outpaced their peers. NVDA, under the leadership of founder Jensen Huang, has seen its revenues surge sixfold in just four years (from $11B to $61B). Moreover, this revenue growth is accompanied by a staggering 11-fold increase in earnings before taxes (from $3B to $33B)! Again, all within four years. This unprecedented growth would be unusual for any company let alone a company that began its ascent with a $100B market cap. To put in perspective, Microsoft and Apple, two massive mega cap companies, have also enjoyed exceptional growth. But in their cases, revenues have increased 59% and 41%, respectively coinciding with stock appreciation of 170% and 155%. Their stock appreciation is well above the 68% return for the broader S&P 500 Index over the same time period, but appears mundane compared to NVDA.\nJust how unusual is the growth of Nvidia? We performed an analysis of 66,000 publicly traded companies over the past 5 years using Bloomberg and S&P databases. Out of this group, there were 1552 companies that were above the $10 Billion minimum threshold for Large Capitalization classification and approximately 940 of those firms had earnings before taxes above $1 Billion. Out of these criteria, there was only 1 company out of the original 66,000 companies that met the threshold of EITHER 1) 35% compounded annual growth rate in revenues, or 2) 50% compounded annual growth rate in EBITDA during our time period\u2014NVIDIA.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) is another red hot AI stock that is truly unique. In recent weeks, its stock price seems to have reached a parabolic state. The company, led by Charles Liang, has experienced exponential growth, with its stock soaring close to 6200% over the past five years. This performance has exceeded virtually all other stocks in our database for the past 5 years and has passed NVIDIA stock price appreciation by almost 3x (6200% vs 2270%). Notable about SMCI is that out of the same 66,000 global publicly traded companies in our database, this company stands out in a singular manner. We start will the entire database of all small cap companies that had a market capitalization below $1.1 Billion 5 years ago. After screening for a minimum income level per year starting with SMCI\u2019s $80M, there were no other companies in the database that met this threshold with anything approaching the SMCI increases. SMCI was the only Small Cap company that had earnings increases each year, beginning with the same base and culminating with a 10x rise in 5 years. Just like with NVDA, SMCI was a distinct company throughout our global database. These numbers underscore the exceptional performance of both companies amidst the AI frenzy.\n\nWhile the eye-popping stock price appreciation of NVDA and SMCI may raise concerns about valuation, it's essential to delve deeper into the fundamentals driving these gains. Both companies have demonstrated solid revenue growth, profit expansion, and margin improvement, setting them apart from their peers. NVDA, in particular, has been successful in capturing market share and expanding its EBITDA margin, signaling strong underlying business fundamentals. Despite their elevated valuations relative to peers, many investors find justification in their above-average growth metrics.\n\n\nInvesting in high-growth stocks like NVDA and SMCI comes with its share of risks. Market corrections, shifts in investor sentiment, and regulatory challenges are all factors that could impact the trajectory of these companies. Additionally, the sustainability of their rapid growth rates over the long term remains a key consideration for investors. While AI is expected to be a long-term trend with significant growth potential, investors should remain vigilant and exercise caution amidst the current market exuberance.\nConclusion:\nAs the AI revolution continues to unfold, NVIDIA and Super Micro Computers stand out as leaders in the field, with their remarkable growth trajectories and innovative offerings. While their stock prices have surged to unprecedented levels, driven by strong fundamentals and market optimism, investors should tread carefully and assess the risks associated with investing in high-growth stocks. While NVDA and SMCI may continue to outperform their peers in the foreseeable future, prudent investment decisions should be guided by a thorough understanding of their business models, competitive positioning, and the broader market dynamics shaping the AI landscape.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

It was one of the best-performing names of 2023, with a\u00a0staggering gain of more than 240% and this year is off to a good start with shares up more than 33%\nNvidia has been riding high on the booming demand for its artificial intelligence solutions, and it seems like the company could continue to do for the foreseeable future, despite claims that the AI \u201ccraze\u201d may be blown out of proportion. Below are three reasons why I forecast NVDA\u2019s shares to rise above $700 in February.\nA NVDA Stock Forecast: The AI Factor\nNvidia dominates in both gaming GPUs and AI chips. Nvidia dominates about 81% of the market for AI chips used in cloud and data centers. Nvidia\u2019s TensorRT software\u00a0enables fast and efficient inference\u00a0of AI models on edge devices.\nDespite many Wall Street analysts now saying the AI \u201ccraze\u201d is overblown, businesses in both the United States and elsewhere will probably not temper their demand for these kinds of computing products. Sure, there are businesses certainly playing into the hype of AI to sell certain \u201cAI-enhanced\u201d products, but that still guarantees there will be demand for the chips that make these products work. \nNvidia\u00a0announced a $1 billion deal\u00a0to provide India-based companies with its AI chips. This is likely just the beginning of the effect these chips will have on the international stage. \nChip Demand to Increase in 2024\nTo have a sense of chip demand, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\u00a0(NYSE:TSM) and its business outlook is a great indicator. TSMC is behind the manufacturing of advanced silicon from Nvidia and its competitors, and the contract chip manufacturing has consecutively provided the market with positive news. \nLast year, in their\u00a0Q3 earnings report, TSM not only boosted revenue guidance but also predicted the \u201cchip slump\u201d was coming to an end. Similarly, in January, CEO C.C. Wei\u00a0mentioned\u00a0the company would return to growth in 2024 due to an overwhelming demand for AI chips, definitively marking the bottom of the chip maker slump.\u00a0\nNvidia will undoubtedly benefit from this demand TSMC\u2019s foresees, and the company will also be a beneficiary of the ending chip slump.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s P/E multiple is high, it\u2019s not stretched thin\nNvidia\u2019s stock is trading at a record high, but its forward P/E ratio is well below where it was 12 months ago. Then, the stock was trading at over 54.2x forward earnings. Nowadays, the chip maker\u2019s stock trades for just 33.8x forward earnings. During the height of the AI craze in 2023, Nvidia\u2019s multiple went as a high as 69.7x forward earnings.\nThat\u2019s all to say, despite Nvidia\u2019s valuation looking expensive, it is much less than it was in prior months. Given the extent to which Nvidia could profit from businesses adopting AI solutions, the chipmaker\u2019s current multiple is likely justified.  \nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

With a rapidly increasing market value, Nvidia has become the third most valuable U.S. company.\nNvidia\u2019s largest investment of $147.3 million was in chip designer\u00a0Arm Holdings, according to the report. Nvidia previously attempted to acquire Arm in an $80 billion deal but was blocked by antitrust regulations two years ago. While Arm\u2019s shares dipped slightly after Nvidia\u2019s disclosure, they had already surged over 60% in the previous week due to a strong forecast.\nIn addition, Nvidia invested nearly $76 million in\u00a0Recursion, a biotech firm focused on accelerating the training of AI models for drug discovery, per the report. Following the disclosure, Recursion Pharmaceuticals saw a 5% increase in its shares.\u00a0\nNvidia also invested approximately $3.7 million in\u00a0SoundHound AI, a developer of conversational voice assistants, according to the report. The disclosure of this investment caused SoundHound AI\u2019s shares to surge by 50%.\nFurthermore, Nvidia acquired a stake in\u00a0Nano-X Imaging, an Israel-based medical device company that utilizes AI software for report analysis, the report said. Nano-X Imaging\u2019s shares rose by 52% following Nvidia\u2019s disclosure.\nAdditionally, Nvidia provided $3 million in capital to\u00a0TuSimple Holdings, an autonomous driving technology company that recently delisted from the Nasdaq.\nInvestors view Nvidia\u2019s involvement as a positive sign, which can help these companies raise capital, the report said. However, Nvidia\u2019s investments indicate a portfolio approach, meaning there may be both winners and losers among the companies it has invested in.\u00a0\nIt was reported Tuesday (Feb. 13) that Nvidia exceeded Amazon in\u00a0market value, marking the first time since 2002 that the chipmaker is worth more than the retailer after market close.\nNvidia has become the go-to company for\u00a0computer chips\u00a0used in AI processes, to such a degree that its gains have shut off the funding tap for its potential competitors.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.\u00a0\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, ARM Holdings, artificial intelligence, economy, funding, Investments, Nano-X Imaging, News, NVIDIA, PYMNTS News, Recursion, SoundHound AI, Stocks, TuSimple Holdings, What's Hot, working capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n                FlexTecs Updates FlexTrap Tool to Capture Payments Discrepancies            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That stunning rally was fueled by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which drove data center operators to purchase more of its high-performance AI servers.  A lot of Supermicro's growth can be directly attributed to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which provides the high-end GPUs that process complex machine learning and AI tasks. Nvidia worked closely with Supermicro to design a new line of servers and workstations that fully supported its H100 GPUs, and that tight relationship enabled Supermicro to carve out a high-growth niche with its AI servers in the heavily commoditized market for pre-built servers.   Image source: Getty Images.   Yet Supermicro's dependence on Nvidia is a double-edged sword. It struggled to secure a steady supply of Nvidia's GPUs in early 2023, and its two largest competitors -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies -- have also been working with Nvidia to design new AI servers. In its latest 10-K filing, Supermicro admitted that it doesn't hold any long-term agreements with Nvidia or its other suppliers that actually lock them in as exclusive partners. That's why AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) recent expansion into the data center GPU market might be great news for Supermicro. Why AMD could catch up to Nvidia in the AI race AMD only controlled about 17% of the discrete GPU market last year, according to Jon Peddie Research, putting it in a distant second place behind Nvidia with its 80% share. AMD's share mainly consists of gaming GPUs for PCs, but it has been expanding its reach into the data center market with its Instinct GPUs for processing AI tasks. AMD rolled out its first batch of Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017. It launched its newest MI300 Instinct GPUs, which are manufactured using TSMC's 5nm and 6nm process nodes, in late 2023. By several industry benchmarks, AMD's high-end MI300X actually beat Nvidia's H100 in terms of raw processing power and memory usage.  That's a bright red flag for Nvidia, since the H100, which faces ongoing supply chain constraints, still costs about four times as much as the MI300. Nvidia claims the H100 still beats the MI300 when it's running optimized software, but that slight difference probably won't justify its premium price tag for cost-conscious data center operators. That's why it wasn't surprising when AMD's CEO Lisa Su recently said the MI300 was on track to be the \"fastest revenue ramp of any product\" in the company's history. Su also estimates that AMD's Epyc CPUs have claimed 25% of the server CPU market at the expense of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) market-leading Xeons. Between the growth of those two businesses and the expansion of its programmable chip business (from Xilinx), AMD has more data center bundling options than Nvidia.   Story Continues Cozying up to AMDSupermicro already works closely with AMD to design servers for its Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs. In November, Supermicro CEO Charles Liang predicted that AMD's MI300 GPUs, Nvidia's latest GPUs, and Intel's Gaudi AI accelerator chips would all \"gain broad adoption and expand our share in the accelerated compute market.\" In January, Liang predicted that ongoing diversification would \"more than double the size\" of the company's AI portfolio.If Supermicro sells more AMD-powered AI servers, it could reduce its long-term dependence on Nvidia and insulate itself from any future supply chain constraints. Competitive pressure from AMD could also drive Nvidia to lower its GPU prices, which would boost Supermicro's gross margins by reducing its component costs.A well-balanced play on the AI marketSupermicro already generates about half of its revenue from its AI servers, and Bank of America believes it could expand its share of the dedicated AI server market from 10% today to 17% over the next three years.That's why analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 42% from its fiscal 2023 (which ended in June) through its fiscal 2026. That's a stunning growth rate for a stock that trades at just 3 times this year's sales.That low valuation already makes Supermicro an attractive long-term play on the AI market, but its gradual diversification away from Nvidia with AMD-powered servers might make it a more balanced play on the AI market than either chipmaker.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Photograph: Brendan McDermid/ReutersTechnology This article is more than 1 year oldNvidia reports enormous revenue as AI hits a tipping pointThis article is more than 1 year oldRevenue at artificial intelligence chipmaker up more than 250% as CEO says \u2018demand is surging worldwide\u2019Blake MontgomeryWed 21 Feb 2024 22.04 GMTLast modified on Thu 13 Jun 2024 20.02 BSTShareThe artificial intelligence boom is pushing demand for Nvidia\u2019s products past Wall Street\u2019s already lofty expectations.The chipmaker beat analyst expectations on Wednesday by leaps and bounds when it reported fourth-quarter earnings, posting $22.1bn in revenue on an expected $20.55bn and $4.93 in earnings per share against an expected $4.64. Revenue was 22% higher than the previous quarter, up 265% from a year ago.Nvidia\u2019s most closely watched earnings figure \u2013 revenue from data centers \u2013 was up more than 400% from the same period last year, reaching $18.4bn.Nvidia to release three new AI chips for China after US restrictions \u2013 reportRead moreJensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a press release: \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201dNvidia\u2019s revenue and demand for its shares are seen as bellwethers for overall interest in artificial intelligence due to the heavy reliance on its wares in developing AI. Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Meta and Google have all struck deals with the company to purchase its chips in bulk as they race to release new AI products and features.Some key players, including OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, are toying with starting their own AI chip ventures to compete with the established Nvidia, which would probably cost hundreds of billions of dollars.Nvidia plans to ship a new chip, the B100, at the highest end of its products line in 2024, stoking expectations around its explosive growth. Nokia and Nvidia announced a partnership on Wednesday to develop AI solutions that could improve telecommunications infrastructure.Wall Street has come to expect enormous growth from Nvidia; the baseline analyst expectation on Wednesday was a 240% increase in revenue. Tech companies are rushing to create AI products on the back of the company\u2019s specialized AI chips and software, considered among the best on the market.Nvidia\u2019s revenue tripled in the last quarter, and its earnings have beaten analyst expectations for the past four.Its stock has more than tripled in value over the past year, bringing the company above the $1.5tn valuation threshold. The company surpassed Google and Amazon in market capitalization last week, becoming the third-largest company in the world by value for a few days.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsNvidianewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

For the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. That's a massive jump from the same period last quarter when Nvidia reported EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. To put a finer point on Nvidia's performance, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.  The company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter. \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. Shares of Nvidia were up more than 15% in Thursday trading following the report. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.24 -2.29 (-1.92%)  As of 2:56:08 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    \u201cOur Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers \u2014 demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies. Vertical industries \u2014 led by auto, financial services and healthcare \u2014 are now at a multibillion-dollar level,\" Huang said in the statement. Despite the across-the-board beat, Nvidia did have at least one negative comment in its report, with CFO Colette Kress warning that data center revenue out of China fell \"significantly\" in Q4 due to US licensing requirements. The US has blacklisted the sale of certain Nvidia chips to China on fears that they could be used for military applications.  Nvidia's all-important Data Center business, which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue of $18.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $17.2 billion. The company reported revenue of $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Overall, Nvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 217% for the year.   While Nvidia's Data Center segment is driving the ship, its gaming business is still an important piece of the company. Revenue for the division topped out at $2.9 billion. Investors were expecting revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year. Nvidia's stock price has skyrocketed more than 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), thanks to its position as the world's leading AI chipmaker.   Story Continues Nvidia\u2019s growth, however, faces challenges from all sides. The company\u2019s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia\u2019s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD\u2019s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities. Nvidia\u2019s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.And that could prove especially problematic as the company said more than half of its Data Center revenue in Q4 came from large cloud providers for internal workloads and external customers.But Nvidia isn\u2019t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.

These experts are at the forefront of combining quantum computing with classical supercomputing to tackle some of the most complex problems in science and technology.\nDr. Jin-Sung Kim from NVIDIA emphasized the importance of ecosystem collaboration.\n\u201cNVIDIA is working with partners across industry, universities, and government labs to build an ecosystem that will make this happen,\u201d said Kim. This collaborative approach is crucial for the development and application of quantum computing technologies.\nAt the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), Dr. Katie Klymko highlighted the role of simulation in quantum research.\n\u201cGPU-powered supercomputers like Perlmutter enable the entire quantum community to develop better algorithms and processors,\u201d she said.\nKlymko\u2019s work demonstrates how classical computing resources can advance quantum computing research.\nDr. Nathan Gemelke of QuEra Computing discussed the innovative use of atoms as qubits.\n\u201cThe way that we quantum compute is that we take individual single atoms and we cool them down,\u201d said Gemelke. \u201cUsing laser cooling, we trap them in a focus laser beam that we call an optical tweezer.\u201d\nThis approach represents a promising direction for increasing the scale and fidelity of quantum computing.\nHighlighting the challenge of error correction, Dr. Yonatan Cohen from Quantum Machines, said: \u201cThe main problem with quantum processors today is that they\u2019re noisy and there are lots of errors.\u201d\nHis partnership with NVIDIA to build the DGX Quantum system aims to address these errors by improving the interaction between quantum processors and classical computing power.\nThe film also touched on the concept of hybrid algorithms, where Klymko noted that \u201cthere are a lot of hybrid algorithms that are actively being developed and deployed.\u201d These algorithms leverage the strengths of both quantum and classical computing to solve complex problems more efficiently.\nThe insights from Kim, Klymko, Gemelke, and Cohen underscore the multidisciplinary effort required to advance quantum computing. By addressing the challenges of simulation, scale, fidelity, and error correction, the experts are paving the way for quantum computing to revolutionize fields such as drug discovery, environmental science, and beyond.\nIf you found this article to be informative, you can explore more current quantum news here, exclusives, interviews, and podcasts.\n\n\n\n\nbusinessNVIDIAquantum computingquantum technologyresearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Dargan \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Dargan is a writer and researcher at The Quantum Insider.

(Photo: Nvidia / Reuters)Given the company\u2019s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.\u201cThe response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,\u201d said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia\u2019s performance. \u201cIf Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.\u201dNvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That\u2019s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market\u2019s key drivers over the past year.Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.The company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the S&P 500. As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.Nvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.Rapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.The company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.Nvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm or Comcast.Related articles:Nvidia Sr. Director of AI Research: \"Israel must invest more in AI to reclaim a leadership position in this field\"Nvidia SVP software: \"Without Israeli entrepreneurship we would not have reached where we are as a company\"Nvidia donates $15 million to non-profits amidst warNvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.Options wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia\u2019s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.While Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology.Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.Even beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have been playing up their exposure to AI.Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme.

That\u2019s how much sales in Nvidia\u2019s AI-heavy Datacenter division rose during Q4 on an annual basis, surging from $3.6 billion to $18.4 billion.\n\nKey Background\nDespite a recent share price decline outpacing a broader tech downturn, Nvidia is the hottest big stock in the U.S. in recent months, as its share price has exploded from below $120 to almost $700 over the past 15 months, sending Nvidia\u2019s market value from just above $300 billion to over $1.7 trillion in the process. Nvidia\u2019s boom coincided with massive, AI-fueled earnings growth\u2014its quarterly profits are more than 10 times higher than they were four years ago\u2014but questions remain on whether Nvidia can deliver the financial results needed to justify its valuation that places it among the most valuable companies in the world. Wall Street analysts are largely convinced that Nvidia can deliver, as average forecasts expect Nvidia\u2019s profits and sales to grow another 60% or more apiece during the current fiscal year.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cFew things are more certain than death, taxes, and Nvidia beats on earnings,\u201d remarked Carson Group strategist Ryan Detrick in emailed comments.\n\n\nFurther ReadingForbesNvidia Stock Falls 6%-Worst Day Since 2022 Ahead Of Key Earnings ReportBy Derek Saul\nForbes\u200b\u200bHow Nvidia's Investment Arm Is Supercharging A New Class Of AI StartupsBy Richard Nieva\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

It's one that's eminently capable of sifting through old documents or distilling down the essence of YouTube videos.Chat with RTX is now available to download from Nvidia's website for free from today, February 13. It works with any current or last generation graphics card with at least 8GB or more VRAM, which includes every desktop card bar the RTX 3050 6GB and excludes a few mid- to low-end laptop GPUs. It also requires 50\u2014100GB of storage space on your PC, depending on the AI models downloaded.There are two models to choose from: Mistral or Llama 2. The default is Mistral, and I'd recommend sticking with that.\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\n\nI've been testing Nvidia's new Neural Texture Compression toolkit and the impressive results could be good news for game install sizes\n\n\n\n\nI'll say it: The best thing I saw from Nvidia at CES wasn't its sweet new GPUs, but some tasty AI every RTX gamer can enjoy\n\n\n\nThe key parts of Chat with RTX are retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and TensorRT-LLM. The former means you're able to give the LLM information and it which it will use alongside its internal training to generate accurate responses to your queries. The latter builds TensorRT engines that can exploit the silicon in Nvidia's GeForce GPUs to more efficiently run AI applications.The result is an LLM you can feed your own data to (.txt, .pdf, and .doc filetypes) and which you can then query on that data.For example, I've been playing around with the tool these past few days and since I create a lot of documents as a part of this job this feels like the prime dataset to stuff into its gaping maw. So I've set up Chat with RTX on my RTX 4080 powered PC (install size of 61.7GB) and fed the Mistral model over 1,300 of wonderful prose (ahem, or rather my news article drafts). I then set about asking it some questions.First, I asked 'Could you name the articles where I mention Nvidia?'The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.(Image credit: Nvidia)Out comes the above response listing three articles with their file path. Now, I've definitely spoken about Nvidia more than three times in 1,300 articles, so let's give that another try.I ask again, rewording the query a little, 'Could you list every article in which I mention Nvidia?'(Image credit: Nvidia)This time eight articles are listed, this time with the Google Doc titles listed. I've mentioned Nvidia many more times than that, but you get the general idea of how this all works. Each response does appear grounded in truth, with each response citing the data used to generate it, if not always the whole truth. Simply using the Windows search function within the article dataset brings up 128 drafts including the term 'Nvidia' in the title, let alone the body copy.Another example is if I ask Chat with RTX to tell me how many times I've used the word cheese, it tells me I've never used the phrase, citing an untitled and unrelated document as the source for the information. Nevertheless, it's probably right about the cheese thing. Until now, anyways.Yet the tool is more exciting once you start asking it to summarise large quantities of information down into single bite-sized responses.\u00a0I asked Chat with RTX whether I should buy an Intel Core i9 14900K, and it came back to me with a trimmed version of my own 14900K review, which succinctly summarised it to \"Based on the review, it appears that the Intel Core i9 14900K may not be worth the extra cost compared to the Core i9 13900K\".Couldn't put it better myself.(Image credit: Nvidia)I also asked Chat with RTX to summarise an article I wrote a while back on Alpine's F1 esports team, which it explained succinctly, and then to tell me about Intel's Meteor Lake processors, which I knew were covered a few times in the articles within the dataset.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)(Image credit: Nvidia)Oh, and I asked it who I was. This was more to make myself feel important as the LLM returned a description of me in near-enough the same words as I used to describe myself for my site bio. Theoretically, you could just feed Chat with RTX a thousands documents on how great you are and create a narcissist's dream software.\u00a0Not that I'd do that, nope.(Image credit: Nvidia)It's the summarising of large datasets that I could see this tool being useful for. Though I doubt everyone has such a need for that. The average PC user might not fancy a 100GB app to tell them what they already know. But, say you're working with a huge amount of responses to a survey and you want to quickly get an idea of the general thoughts and feelings of those who answered, this is one easy way to do it. But it is best used with caution and as only a guide to the inputted dataset, not as a way to accurately analyse it fully.The other people it might appeal to are those that prefer to keep their content out of the cloud. The idea of asking an AI hosted God-knows-where to handle files that could contain sensitive information, or manuscripts for your big action movie idea, isn't that appealing to many. We've already seen what this looks like when it goes wrong courtesy of Samsung's employees. That's why a locally-run tool such as this might instead appeal.The other use for Chat with RTX is to feed it YouTube videos then query it on the contents. I grabbed an episode of Chat Log, a podcast hosted by my colleagues Lauren Morton and Mollie Taylor, and fed it into the machine. The episode is titled 'Does the Steam Deck suit out PC gaming lifestyle so far?'I asked, 'Is the Steam Deck easy to use day-to-day?' and a response prints out that sums up Lauren and Mollie's conversation with Tyler Colp on the matter.(Image credit: Nvidia)I also then asked the obvious question, 'Does the Steam Deck suit their PC gaming lifestyle so far?' The response:(Image credit: Nvidia)This feature works by downloading the transcript of the YouTube video, ingesting it, and using RAG to respond appropriately to a user's questions. It definitely appears to generate good summaries of a YouTube videos with plenty of talking, though due to the reliance of transcripts, you can't feed it anything that relies on visual information. Feed it the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer with next to no words throughout and you'll get nothing out of it.I'm not so sure about the YouTube usage. On the one hand, I could see it being useful for a summary of a long live stream or event which you don't have time to watch yourself, though it's a chunky application to have around for those few instances where that's a thing. Similarly, the YouTube creator doesn't appear to get a view out of this, and I tend to fall in the 'AIs scraping information from creators online and offering nothing in exchange will break the very core of the internet as we know it' camp. This application alone might not make much of a difference, but I do strongly believe if you want the information provided by someone, you should at least support them creating more like it.The console window that shows some of the inner workings of Chat with RTX. (Image credit: Nvidia)Anyways, the YouTube stuff takes a backseat for me with Chat with RTX. It's the mass local text file digestion that feels the most important piece of the software. As an application, it's pretty snappy. It generates responses swiftly once you hit send on a query. Though it does appear to gobble up around 85% of my VRAM\u2014you need to be sure to close it properly with the off switch to release that back to the PC once you're done with it.\u00a0Chat with RTX is a fun concept, and a good way for Nvidia to show what's inference locally on its GeForce cards can do, but I'm not sure I'm going to keep it around on my PC. For one, it's absolutely massive due to the huge model data, but more so because the actual practical uses are pretty limited for me, personally.\u00a0Perhaps some clever clogs will come up with new and exciting ways to put it into practice now that it's available to the world. That could be you, providing you have the proper hardware.

Revenue for the period rose by an astonishing 265% to $22.1 billion, ahead of the $20.62 billion target, thanks in part to what the company said were strong sales of its \u201cHopper\u201d graphics processing units, such as the H100 GPU.\nAll told, the company reported net income of $12.29 billion during the quarter, representing growth of 769% from the year ago quarter, when it delivered a profit of just $1.41 billion.\nLooking to the current quarter, Nvidia said it\u2019s expecting to deliver $24 billion in sales, versus the Street\u2019s forecast of $22.17 billion in revenue.\nThe Street was once again thrilled, and Nvidia\u2019s fast-growing stock made yet more gains, rising by more than 7% in the after-hours trading session. Update: Shares rose about 15% Thursday, giving it a market capitalization approaching $2 trillion.\nNvidia has become the primary beneficiary of the enormous demand for computing power to support AI projects, which have become a must for almost every enterprise these days thanks to the buzz around generative AI models such as ChatGPT. In a conference call, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang (pictured) attempted to address fears raised by some investors and analysts that the company might not be able to keep pace with the enormous demand for its GPUs, which are essential for training AI and powering workloads in production.\nHuang insisted that the \u201cconditions are excellent for continued growth\u201d throughout fiscal 2025 and beyond. He explained that the company believes demand for its GPUs will remain elevated due to the interest in generative AI and also an industry-wide shift from central processing units to the company\u2019s accelerator chips.\nIn a press release, the company said the demand for its technology was driven by both enterprise software and consumer internet applications across multiple industries, including automotive, healthcare and financial services.\nSales related to AI workloads are reported in Nvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, which now accounts for the bulk of the company\u2019s revenue. The unit reported revenue of $18.4 billion, up by 409% from a year earlier. Within that segment, more than half of all sales were attributed to large cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services Inc.\nEver since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, Nvidia has seen huge demand for its GPUs from technology giants such as Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as generative AI startups such as Anthropic PMC and Cohere Inc., as they race with one another to launch increasingly powerful large language models that can perform more tasks. Generative AI models require massive amounts of computing power.\nLast month, for instance, Meta Platforms Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that his company intends to buy more than 350,000 of Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs by the end of the year, a statement that suggests it will spend billions of dollars on the chipmaker\u2019s products.\nOver the last three quarters, Nvidia\u2019s data center business has grown enormously to become the clear market leader in the AI computing industry.\nOn the conference call, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said its data center revenue would have been even higher if not for the new restrictions placed by the U.S. government on China. The company has been prohibited from shipping its most powerful products to Chinese customers over fears that its technology could end up in the hands of the country\u2019s military.\nThe demand being placed on the data center business is such that its GPUs remain in short supply, and though Kress insisted the situation has improved, she admitted the company is still struggling to fulfill all of its customer\u2019s orders.\n\u201cWe are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving,\u201d Kress told analysts. \u201cDemand for Hopper remains very strong. We can expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\u201d\nThird Bridge analyst Lucas Keh said the restrictions on China and the supply concerns continue to be the biggest threats to Nvidia\u2019s growth prospects. For instance, he said, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is now close to hitting its capacity limit for the silicon wafers used by the company\u2019s most advanced GPUs. \u201cInvestors should keep an eye out for Nvidia\u2019s plans to diversify its supply base, and how quickly it will be able to do so,\u201d Keh said.\nThe incredible rise of Nvidia\u2019s fortunes in recent years represents the technology industry\u2019s best example of a rags to riches story, for it was only about five years ago that the company\u2019s future was looking extremely bleak, as none of the major cloud providers would embrace its GPU platforms, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. Instead, the cloud vendors were betting on their own customized silicon, leaving Nvidia to ponder a future of shrinking on-premises-based growth.\nAs such, Nvidia spread its bets with its focus on AI, creating a diversification strategy that is now paying off handsomely, Mueller explained. \u201cFor a company in the double-digit billion dollar revenue range to double its sales is unheard of an unseen in the tech industry,\u201d the analyst continued. \u201cDespite this, there is no one really challenging Nvidia in AI yet, as AMD and Intel are barely blips on its radar with their first, nascent offerings. Going forward, the most urgent tasks for Jensen Huang and team are to keep fostering and building out an ecosystem, stay on top of the supply chain challenges and keep regulators happy. Do that and they\u2019ll keep on winning.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s gaming business, which sells GPUs for laptops, PCs and consoles, delivered revenue of $2.87 billion, up by 56% from a year earlier. The division used to be the company\u2019s biggest revenue generator until the AI craze took off.\nElsewhere, the company reported that its automotive unit\u2019s revenue declined 4% from a year earlier, to just $281 million, while revenue in the \u201cOEM and other\u201d segment, which includes chips for mining cryptocurrency, rose by 7%, to $90 million. Lastly, the professional applications unit saw sales rise by 105%, to $463 million.\nPhoto: Nvidia\n\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content. \u00a0\nJoin our community on YouTube\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n\n\n\u201cTheCUBE\u00a0is an important partner to the industry.

[+] COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nNvidia\u2019s market value has been growing so fast \u2014 up more than five-fold since 2011, according to CNBC \u2014 that the AI chip designer\u2019s stock price was poised to plummet.\n\n\nBut Nvidia defied the pessimists when it reported results for the quarter ending January 2024. After posting faster than expected growth in the last quarter and raising guidance for the current quarter, investors sent the stock up more than 14% in off-hours trading on February 21.\n\nSince Nvidia\u2019s dominant role in the widespread adoption of Generative AI is still in its early stages, the stock remains a great investment.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Q4 Performance And Prospects\n\nBy the standards of almost any company, Nvidia\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 performance was outstanding. And fortunately for investors, Nvidia beat expectations and raised guidance.\n\nHere are the key numbers from CNBC:\n\n\nQ4 2023 revenue up 265% to $22.1 billion \u2014 $1.5 billion more than analysts\u2019 consensus of $20.6 billion for the period ending January 28, according to London Stock Exchange Group.\nQ4 2023 adjusted earnings per share up 804% to $5.15 per share \u2014 56 cents per share more than the analyst consensus of $4.59, according to Barron\u2019s.\nQ1 2024 revenue guidance of 300% growth to $24 billion \u2014 $2,4 billion more than the $21.6 billion analysts\u2019 consensus, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nIn a statement, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described AI as hitting \u201cthe tipping point\u201d as hunger for computing to build and operate Generative AI remains enormous. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d\n\nWhy Nvidia Leads The AI Chip Race\nNvidia leads the AI chip industry \u2014 with 80% to 95% market share, according to The Globe and Mail \u2014 and has been building competitive advantages for more than 15 years to sustain its leadership position.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Differentiation Strategy\nIf a company wants to lead its industry, it must choose one of two strategies:\n\n\nDifferentiation \u2014 where the company delivers more value to customers than competing products and charges a price premium; and\nLow-Cost Producer \u2014 where a competitor sets its price well below the industry average and reaps scale economies enabling it to reduce its costs below its price.\n\n\nAs I wrote last August, Nvidia is a differentiator as evidenced by customers\u2019 willingness to pay a significant price premium and to wait for over a year to obtain its chips. In an interview with the New York Times\nNYT\n\nNYT\n, Futurum Group analyst Daniel Newman said, \u201cCustomers will wait 18 months to buy an Nvidia system rather than buy an available, off-the-shelf chip from either a start-up or another competitor. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\nNvidia chips are expensive; however, the company argues they enable companies to save time training their large language models \u2014 which more than offsets the price premium.\nThe price for each Nvidia H100 ranges from $15,000 to more than $40,000. AWS Vice President David Brown said Amazon\u2019s AI chips are a bargain compared to Nvidia\u2019s.\nHuang disagrees. \u201cIf you can reduce the time of training to half on a $5 billion data center, the savings is more than the cost of all of the chips.\u201d he said in the Times report. \u201cWe are the lowest-cost solution in the world.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s Competitive Advantages\nNvidia\u2019s competitive advantages flow from the company\u2019s ability to adapt to new opportunities faster than rivals and a page it took from Apple\nAAPL\n \u2014 creating a community of programmers who happily build software to run on your hardware.\nNaveen Rao is an entrepreneur who sold his gaming and AI chip startup to Intel. Rao saw Nvidia adapting Graphics Processing Units for AI far more rapidly than did Intel. He left Intel and started a software company, MosaicML where he compared Nvidia chips to its rivals. Rao told the Times, \u201cEverybody builds on Nvidia first. If you come out with a new piece of hardware, you\u2019re racing to catch up.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s competitive advantages make it difficult for rivals to gain market share. The Times reported these competitive advantages include:\n\n\nLaunching CUDA. In 2006, Nvidia announced CUDA \u2014 software for programming GPUs for other fields such as physics or chemical simulation. In 2012, researchers used the chips to identify a cat with precision.\nHiring an AI team. Nvidia hired a team to train LLMs \u2014 gaining early insights into what AI practitioners wanted. Using that market intelligence, Nvidia built libraries \u2014 to perform tasks common to AI development \u2014 thus saving the developers\u2019 time.\nBuilding faster chips every few years and expanding to complete computers. Nvidia consistently delivered faster chips every few years. In 2017, it began tailoring GPUs to handle specific AI calculations, sold chips or circuit boards for other companies, and provided complete computers aimed at faster AI processing.\nIntroducing RTX 4800 and B100 chips. In January 2024, Nvidia launched RTX 4800 chips for consumer devices \u2014 primarily aimed at gamers but also useful for AI \u2014 with the ability to \u201cgenerate AI video 150% faster than the last-generation model,\u201d CNBC wrote. In late 2024, Nvidia is expected to launch a new AI system called B100. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore called the B100 \u201ca strong advancement of state of the art,\u201d the Journal noted. Bank of America\nBAC\n analyst Vivek Arya expects the price of B100 products to be 10% to 30% higher than the popular H100 system, reported the Journal.\nForming partnerships with Big Tech companies and investing in startups. Nvidia collaborates with large technology companies such as ServiceNow\nNOW\n\nNOW\n and Snowflake and funds startups. Nvidia invested in a $1.3 billion June 2023 financing for Inflection AI, which used to money to help finance 22,000 H100 chips.\n\n\nThese competitive advantages are difficult for rivals to copy. Moor Insights semiconductor analyst Patrick Moorhead told CNBC, \u201cNvidia has a double moat right now in that they have the highest performance training hardware. Then on the input side of the software, in AI, there are libraries and CUDA.\u201d\nWhere Nvidia Stock Will Go Next\nIf Nvidia can continue to exceed high growth expectations, its shares will keep rising. However, the case for an Nvidia growth slowdown includes the following headwinds:\n\n\nDemand from big tech buyers could slow. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria wrote Nvidia sells large numbers of GPUs to Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google \u2014 any of which could scale down their AI investment plans if demand slackens, noted CNBC.\nGPU lead times are shortening. Analyst Paulo Santos noted lead times for Nvidia's GPU orders have decreased from between 8 and 11 months down to \u201cjust 3-4 months, indicating a potential future sequential growth peak,\u201d noted Seeking Alpha.\n\n\nNvidia bulls include Melius Research which recommended buying the stock. \u201cIf the upgrade from the A100 to the H100 is any indication, the Total Cost of Ownership benefit for data center operators will be enticing enough to fuel the upgrade and make 2025 a growth year,\u201d noted analyst Ben Reitzes according to CNBC.\nAnalysts do not see much upside. Fifty three of them set an average 12-month price target for Nvidia of $700 a share \u2014 representing 3% upside according to CNN Business.\nIn after-hours trading, the chip designer\u2019s stock blew through that target.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 trading desk called Nvidia \u2014 which tends to fall after earnings reports before resuming an upward climb \u2014 \u201cthe most important stock on planet earth,\u201d noted Bloomberg.\nAfter the boffo earnings report, Nvidia\u2019s stock defied that post-earnings sinking and recovery pattern and became even more important.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has slapped a fresh coat of paint on its software suite with a brand new utility called the 'Nvidia App' that unifies the ancient Nvidia Control Panel and newer GeForce Experience applications. The new app will merge all of Nvidia's outgoing applications into one unified interface for easier navigation. The app is available in beta form and can be downloaded now.\n\nThis update has been a long time coming, as Nvidia hasn't updated its core driver interface in a long time. Nvidia's Control Panel has looked nearly the same today as it did during the Windows XP era. Sometimes the lack of change can be beneficial \u2014 everything is right where you remember \u2014 but I still remember pulling up the same Nvidia control panel we have today on my Pentium 4 rig way back in the late 2000s featuring a Nvidia GeForce 8400GS.\n\nThe lack of any UI updates makes ye olde Control Panel a familiar place, with settings still in the same location after all these years. Its age also improves reliability \u2014 no major changes means no new bugs. Nonetheless, Nvidia was bound to finally scrap the old interface for something more modern, and that day has finally come. Or at least, there's a beta of where things are headed.(Image credit: Nvidia)The Nvidia App overhauls how gamers and prosumers interact with Nvidia GPU features and drivers. It sports a sleek yet simple interface with a sidebar featuring access to different functions, including a home screen, driver area, graphics area, and settings menu.\n\nThe Nvidia App in its present form exists alongside the Nvidia Control Panel, though it replaces GeForce Experience \u2014 and will kindly import your user account and settings from GFE if you're already logged in. And no, it's not getting rid of the log in option, though you can at least use most of the app features without doing so. The app also comes with brand-new features such as AI-powered Freestyle Filters, RTX HDR for games (which we've already seen in modded form), and RTX Dynamic Vibrance.\n\nNvidia has also reworked its gaming overlay that was present in GeForce Experience. The new overlay features more simplistic HUD elements that take up less space on the screen. There's far more customization with the overlay, enabling users to pick and choose which areas of their system they want to monitor.\n\nGiven the number of other applications Nvidia already offers \u2014 Nvidia Broadcast, Nvidia Chat With RTX, FrameView, PCAT, and more \u2014 it's possible the end goal is to offer an extensible and centralized interface to all your Nvidia needs. Certainly, there are loads of AI-powered tasks that are now available, and requiring users to manually install separate apps for each quickly starts to become cumbersome.\n\nFor now, the Nvidia App feels familiar to anyone who has previously used GeForce Experience, and it offers access to many but not all of the features that are in the Control Panel. As a beta that you install separately from the core Nvidia drivers, obviously this isn't a full replacement in the present form.\n\nWhat's the long-term plan? We asked Nvidia's Brian Burke, Global PR Principal. \"We wanted to resolve user feedback on Nvidia Control Panel updates, and unify features from GeForce Experience into one single application. The Nvidia App beta is a first step in our journey to modernize and unify the Nvidia Control Panel, GeForce Experience, and RTX Experience apps into one application. Once we fully migrate features to the Nvidia App, we will end-of-life Nvidia Control Panel and GeForce Experience for GeForce customers.\"\n\nThe new app launches today alongside Nvidia's latest Game Ready driver and can be downloaded today. Being a beta, you can expect some bugs and teething pains, though probably not much worse than what we get from graphics drivers in general.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more GPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (15)\n\n\n\nAaron KlotzSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAaron Klotz is a contributing writer for Tom\u2019s Hardware, covering news related to computer hardware such as CPUs, and graphics cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about gpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\nSee more latest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 Comments\n\nComment from the forums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd no, it's not getting rid of the need to log in with an Nvidia account\nThat's NOT true, and is kind of misleading.

At first glance most of the functionality is the same, but is very clunky when viewing in game. Not very smooth. The new performance overlay though is a big step back IMO. Kind of gaudy looking. Overall, needs some polish and more user friendliness.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmilleron\n\n\nOne of the real annoying aspects of the old Control Panel is the need to re-enter all non-default settings every time you upgrade the driver. Can anyone tell if this new app retains settings after driver upgrades?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabufrejoval\n\n\nThat's terrible news!\n\nFirst of all: that control panel shouldn't exist at all: whatever needs to be configured about these cards, should be configurable using the standard configuration mechanisms of the OS.\n\nSo either M$ or N% haven't done their job or both: fix this instead!\n\nThat said I rarely ever need to venture into the N% control panel, and if I do, it's rarely because I want to, but because I have to, e.g. because connecting a VR headset or temporary screen messed up all the carefully arranged desktop settings...\nfor each of the currently eight N% equipped systems I manage around the home\nsome of which run alternating both Windows and Linux\nsome of which run the above sometimes on bare metal\nbut also sometimes on VMs with GPU pass-throughso there is just a lot of OS instances and screen setups to manage.\n\nSome systems are used more by my kids, who try to squeeze every ounce of performance from their rigs and thus run the Experience stuff. But when daddy has to fix things they broke, I only ever do that up to the control panel: if that works (which means they can get their homework done), I can leave them with their tuning and modding to their heart's content.\n\nIn other words: there is real value in that separation between the essential and the entertainment part: do not mix the two!\n\nAnd then UI design is just terrible these days. Everybody strives to establish their own brand, feel color scheme, skinning etc. while eternal values such as SAA inherited from the good old days of OS/2 and Cobol are sacrificed without remorse.\n\nToday I know where to go and fix things pretty much blindly, because I've use the N% control panel for as long as I've had their GPUs. And that is not just a good thing, it's a great thing! There is real value in things being extremely boring and monotone, e.g. like controls in a car.\n\nSticks shifts used to have individual shift patterns, lights, turning signals and the horn very different in French cars etc. which can be downright fatal if you're trying to advise a careless pedestrian that even a Citroen SM isn't going to stop within 5m.\n\nThat's long past and nearly everbody but that \"chief hallucinator\", who thought cars should autonomously drive as well as he accomodates the views of others, had adapted to a sensible and pretty near global default.\n\nDisruption literally means breaking things beyond fixable: one of the worst ideas ever!\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niSoLateD1\n\n\nI get lower FPS in games with the new drivers and the new Nvidia app. On my 4070 super/Ryzen 5800x I went from 172 fps maxed to 150. Anyone know how to fix?\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 15 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more comments \n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualcomm debuts new Snapdragon G handheld gaming PC chips to compete with Intel and AMD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina to spend $55 billion on R&D in 2025 \u2014 Semiconductor, AI and quantum computing fields to benefit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambu Lab Announces New Printer: H2D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard dies after marathon 100-hour BIOS update process, vigil attended by thousands online\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD boasts its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is up to 12.2x faster than Lunar Lake in AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks \u2014 Also found to generate AI celebrity photos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi and ChatGPT bring AI conversations to your retro rotary phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan \u2014 Eyes 70% as the next target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Since January 2023 the chipmaker\u2019s share price has surged by almost 450%. With the total value of its shares approaching $2trn, Nvidia is now America\u2019s third-most valuable firm, behind Microsoft and Apple. Its revenues for the most recent quarter were $22bn, up from $6bn in the same period last year. Most analysts expect that Nvidia, which controls more than 95% of the market for specialist AI chips, will continue to grow at a blistering pace for the foreseeable future.

For the year as a whole, turnover more than doubled to $60.9bn.\"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" said Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang.\"Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\"Nvidia also forecast a 233% jump in its quarterly revenues for the current quarter, beating analysts' estimates.Nvidia: The chip maker that became an AI superpower\"There was a lot riding on this last quarter and they actually absolutely knocked it out of the park,\" Bob O'Donnell of Technalysis Research told the BBC.\"We're starting to see mainstream usage of AI,\" he added, highlighting that AI is not longer only used by specialised technology companies.In addition to its AI chips, sales at the firm's data centres have grown rapidly.Its data centre business contributed the vast majority of its revenues in the most recent quarter after growing more than than five-fold over the last year.Nvidia said gross profit for the final three months of its financial year rose by 338% to $16.8bn. Annual gross profit rose by 188% to $44.3bn.However, the company said it faced several challenges including constraints on its supply chains.The US has also tightened its restrictions on trade with China, the world's second largest economy.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote, told the BBC that Nvidia's results had been \"unusually amazing\".But she added that Nvidia could face difficulties in addition to restrictions in China. \"Nvidia... will see challenges on the way up because first the revenue growth will likely stabilise and the euphoria regarding these growth and growth perceptions will level out,\" she said.The company is also likely to face competition and regulation issues, Ms Ozkardeskaya added, and it could be \"constrained by their own capacity to respond to this fast-surging demand\". AI's public profile has risen sharply since the launch in 2022 of ChatGPT, which was developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.ChatGPT and other similar systems use huge amounts of data to create convincing human-like responses to user queries.They are expected to dramatically change the way people search for information online.Nvidia's stock market value has soared by 225% over the last year, making it one of the most valuable companies in the US. Its share price jumped by more than 9% in extended New York trading.

This setup allows for conversations with the AI model using local files as a dataset.\n\"Users can quickly, easily connect local files on a PC as a dataset to an open-source large language model like Mistral or Llama 2, enabling queries for quick, contextually relevant answers,\" writes Nvidia in a promotional blog post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                A screenshot of Chat With RTX, which runs in a web browser window.\n                                  \n                    Credit:\n                                          Benj Edwards\n                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      A screenshot of Chat With RTX, which runs in a web browser window.\n\n              \n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Benj Edwards\n\n                  \n\n\n\n\nUsing Chat With RTX, users can talk about various subjects or ask the AI model to summarize or analyze data, similar to how one might interact with ChatGPT. In particular, the Mistal-7B model has built-in conditioning to avoid certain sensitive topics (like sex and violence, of course), but users could presumably somehow plug in an uncensored AI model and discuss forbidden topics without the paternalism inherent in the censored models.\n\nAlso, the application supports a variety of file formats, including .TXT, .PDF, .DOCX, and .XML. Users can direct the tool to browse specific folders, which Chat With RTX then scans to answer queries quickly. It even allows for the incorporation of information from YouTube videos and playlists, offering a way to include external content in its database of knowledge (in the form of embeddings) without requiring an Internet connection to process queries.\nRough around the edges\nWe downloaded and ran Chat With RTX to test it out. The download file is huge, at around 35 gigabytes, owing to the Mistral and Llama LLM weights files being included in the distribution. (\"Weights\" are the actual neural network files containing the values that represent data learned during the AI training process.) When installing, Chat With RTX downloads even more files, and it executes in a console window using Python with an interface that pops up in a web browser window.\nSeveral times during our tests on an RTX 3060 with 12GB of VRAM, Chat With RTX crashed. Like open source LLM interfaces, Chat With RTX is a mess of layered dependencies, relying on Python, CUDA, TensorRT, and others. Nvidia hasn't cracked the code for making the installation sleek and non-brittle. It's a rough-around-the-edges solution that feels very much like an Nvidia skin over other local LLM interfaces (such as GPT4ALL). Even so, it's notable that this capability is officially coming directly from Nvidia.\nOn the bright side (a massive bright side), local processing capability emphasizes user privacy, as sensitive data does not need to be transmitted to cloud-based services (such as with ChatGPT). Using Mistral 7B feels similarly capable to early 2022-era GPT-3, which is still remarkable for a local LLM running on a consumer GPU. It's not a true ChatGPT replacement yet, and it can't touch GPT-4 Turbo or Google Gemini Pro/Ultra in processing capability.\nNvidia GPU owners can download Chat With RTX for free on the Nvidia website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Everybody\u2019s talking about Mistral, an upstart French challenger to OpenAI\n          \n\n            \"Mixture of experts\" Mixtral 8x7B helps open-weights AI punch above its weight class.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Google launches Gemini\u2014a powerful AI model it says can surpass GPT-4\n          \n\n            Google claims Gemini beats GPT-4 in \"30 of the 32 widely used academic benchmarks.\"\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Listing image:\n    Nvidia\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\n\n\n\n\nBenj Edwards\nSenior AI Reporter\n\n\n      Benj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022. He's also a tech historian with almost two decades of experience. In his free time, he writes and records music, collects vintage computers, and enjoys nature. He lives in Raleigh, NC.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    89 Comments\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff Picks\n\n\n\n\nT\n\nTopquark12\n\n\n\n            I tried this yesterday with my 4090. The installation process was painful, the installer was very picky about the installation path and constantly failed without much explanation. Even when Installing on the default path, there were issues that I had to WinDbg to debug, which boiled down to some installation processes started before requisite processes were completed.\n\nI was really interested to feed my collection of electronics engineering books and documents to the tool and be able to ask about specific bits of knowledge without going through the hundreds of pages. There were books with hundreds of pages like \"The art of electronics\", \"Handbook of microwave measurements\", \"Mastering STM32\" etc. along with a lot of useful loose application notes and pdf files. It amounted to 109 items totalling 646MB.\n\nMy box (RTX4090, 7950X3D, 64GB 6000MT/s CL30) took around 35 minutes to train on all the data. I tested with both the Mistral 7B int4 and Llama v2 13B models. According to Google search results, the Mistral model is supposed to be much better, but I didn't really feel the difference.\n\nAnswer generation is very fast, usually within 2 seconds or so. The answers are short, concise and cited the document it got it's answer from, which I appreciated.\n\nI wasn't super impressed about the quality of the answers. It has a tendency to fixate on trying to provide the best (but sometimes wrong) answer it could find within one source, but ignore another source that actually contains a much better and correct answer. \n\nMy laymen assessment of the tool is it doesn't seem to be able to do high level reasoning on which direction to go, which book is the best to pick. Instead it tends to get tunnel visioned into a worse path.\n\nAnyways, I'm really excited for this type of tools to get better in the future. Better privacy from offline tools is of course good, so is not having to pay a subscription or be tied to any particular cloud service company. But the thing I look forward the most is the ability to specify the sources it gets its answer from. I trust my curated books and knowledge base way more than some random SEO website with junk info, which chatGPT often seems to be trained on.\n          \n\n\nFebruary 16, 2024 at 2:22 am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSYNERDATA\n\n\n\n            It is really nice to see the authors mentioned GPT4All by Nomic AI.   I would just like to clarify for everyone some of the differences between ChatRTX and GPT4All, just to ensure everyone who wants to run AI on any computer understands and knows them.\n\nWith GPT4All, which is a really small download, it runs on any CPU and runs models of any size up to the limits of one's system RAM, and with Vulkan API support being added to it, it is also to run on any GPU which supports Vulkan, and any amount of VRAM, and so one does not need an Nvidia GPU to have personal and private AI, nor is one limited to models that only fit within 8GB VRAM.\n\nIf you have a 16GB RAM computer with or without a GPU you can run GPT4All and load llama.cpp based 7b or 13b GGUF models from Hugging Face, but it also runs on computers with 8GB RAM also, for 7b SLM's.\n\nLike ChatRTX, GPT4All also uses RAG to index one's personal documents to query information contained within them.\n\nGPT4All runs on Windows and Mac and Linux systems, having a one-click installer for each, making it super-easy for beginners to get up and running with a full array of models included in the built-in downloader and the ability to side-load most any GGUF LM, as from Hugging Face (/TheBloke and others).\n\nNomic AI which makes GPT4All is based in New York and recieved 17 million in Series-A funding in the summer of 2023 after the launch of GPT4All popularized running AI privately on one's own PC, and so it is not something by some hacker in their mother's basement for those concerned about who makes it, and it continues to recieve full time development with new features continually being added and refined regularly.\n\nWhether or not you have a compatible RTX GPU to run ChatRTX, GPT4All can run Mistral 7b and LLaMA 2 13b and other LM's on any computer with at least one CPU core and enough RAM to hold the model and things, and you can run much larger models if you have the RAM and/or VRAM.  GPT4All enables one to finely adjust all model settings and GPU layers and context window sizes and temperature and repeat penalty and the other settings, including your own System Prompt to tell LM's how to behave, and how many CPU threads to use on multicore CPU's, and includes an HTTP server which uses the standard OpenAI API format so software that links to OpenAI can alternately be addressed to use GPT4All on localport:4891 on your own PC, but also includes a portal to OpenAI within it for those who have an OpenAI API key.\n\nYou do not need to run out and buy an Nvidia GPU just to have a personal private AI server on your system,\nand of course, it is free and zealously open source.\n          \n\n\nFebruary 16, 2024 at 2:24 am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Comments\n  \n\n\nForum view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Loading comments...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrev story\n\n\nNext story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Most Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEverything you say to your Echo will be sent to Amazon starting on March 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\u201cAwful\u201d: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nTrump plan to fund Musk\u2019s Starlink over fiber called \u201cbetrayal\u201d of rural US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nReport: mRNA vaccines are in RFK Jr\u2019s crosshairs; funding in question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSobering revenue stats of 70K mobile apps show why devs beg for subscriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Please also consider subscribing to WIREDUnless you were really into desktop PC gaming a decade ago, you probably haven't given Nvidia much thought until recently. The company makes graphics cards, among other tech, and has earned great success thanks to the strength of the gaming industry. But that has been nothing compared to the explosive growth Nvidia has enjoyed over the past year. That's because Nvidia's tech is well suited to power the machines that run large language models, the basis for the generative AI systems that have swept across the tech industry. Now Nvidia is an absolute behemoth, with a skyrocketing stock value and a tight grip on the most impactful\u2014and controversial\u2014tech of this era.This week on Gadget Lab, we welcome WIRED\u2019s Will Knight, who writes about AI, as our guest.

When you thought of Nvidia back then, what did you think of?Michael Calore: I think of big CES press conferences with the company talking about things like Tegra supercomputing chips and these big events that generally just served word soup.Lauren Goode: That is very accurate. Can you guess what the stock price of Nvidia was then?Michael Calore: I have no idea.Lauren Goode: Are you ready for it?Michael Calore: Yeah.Lauren Goode: It was between $3 and $5.Michael Calore: What is it now?Lauren Goode: It's hovering around $800.Michael Calore: Oh my god. Stop.Lauren Goode: Mm-hmm. Seriously.Michael Calore: Well, we don't own tech stocks here, so sad for us. But what happened to Nvidia?Lauren Goode: Basically, Nvidia started to take over the computing world.Michael Calore: OK, we need to talk about why.Lauren Goode: We really do. Let's do it.[Gadget Lab intro theme music plays]Lauren Goode: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Gadget Lab. I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.Michael Calore: And I'm Michael Calore. I am WIRED's director of consumer tech and culture.Lauren Goode: We're joined this week by WIRED senior writer, Will Knight, who joins us from Cambridge, Massachusetts. He's on Zoom and he has averted his eyes from the latest AI research paper to humor us on the Gadget Lab. Hi, Will.Will Knight: Hello.Lauren Goode: Thanks for being here.Will Knight: Thanks for having me.Lauren Goode: OK. We brought Will on, because today we are talking about the wild rise of Nvidia, the company that started in the 1990s selling graphics chips for video games on PCs. That is oversimplifying it a little, but basically from the earliest days, Nvidia made a bet on accelerated computing versus general purpose computing. They made custom chips that turbocharge the functions of the personal computer. But as Mike and I were talking about, the Nvidia of today is not your Gen X graphic chips maker. Its c-founder and chief executive, Jensen Huang, has consistently positioned the company right ahead of the curve. Right now, Nvidia holds the majority of the market share of AI computing chips. It's also worth nearly $2 trillion.I had a chance to sit down with Jensen in recent months for a WIRED story. I'm sorry to disappoint all of you, but you're not going to hear those interviews here. You're going to have to read it in WIRED. I might also recommend checking out the Acquired podcast for a very, very long, multi-part series on Nvidia that does end with a conversation with Jensen. But we wanted to give you the most clear cut story here of how Nvidia ended up where it did and what the future holds for it.We should probably start with how Nvidia started and maybe not spend too long on it, but talk about that era of the personal computer, the emergence of it in the '90s, and how we transitioned to this, right?Michael Calore: Yes. The company started in 1993, you said?Lauren Goode: That's correct. It's just about as old as WIRED.Michael Calore: What was their big breakthrough that put them on the map?Lauren Goode: Well, we should go back to what PCs were like in the 1990s and specifically what games on PCs were like. Games were starting to become more popular, but they were powered by CPUs, central processing units, and then graphics were kind of like an also-ran. These chips could also do graphics, but they weren't very good. And then Nvidia had this idea to move more towards a customized or specialized unit, a graphics processing unit, which is how we get GPU. A lot of our listeners are going to know what this means, CPU and GPU and the differences, but other people just probably hear these acronyms all the time and don't fully understand what they mean and how they power a computer.Jensen Huang was working at a company called LSI Logic at the time that Nvidia was first conceived. Two of his friends, his cofounders, said to him, \"Hey, let's start this dedicated graphics card company.\" They convinced him, they convinced Jensen. He resigned from his other job and they all started Nvidia. Legend has it that they hatched this whole idea in a Denny's diner. That's 1993, Nvidia begins.Michael Calore: When we were all hanging out in Denny's diners.Lauren Goode: I think some people still do. Good for them.Michael Calore: How did it go? Did it go smoothly? Were there bumps?Lauren Goode: There were definitely some bumps in the road in the mid to late-1990s. One of the first chips that they put out was pretty much a failure and the company nearly went bankrupt. They had to lay off a lot of people, something like close to 70 percent of the staff, and then they had to come up with a plan for a new chip super, super quickly. But a lot of tech production cycles, they're 18 to 24 months, and that was certainly the case for chips. Nvidia didn't have that much runway. They also didn't have their own fab, which is a place where you make all the chips. You're relying on partners to do this. You're working with them hand in hand on the designs and then they're sending chips to you and you're making tweaks and sending it back and stuff. It's a long process.Nvidia did something smart, which is they started using emulators. They started crafting this second ship that they had to launch very quickly in software and testing it that way. They were able to spin up something new within \u2026 I think it was six-ish months, called the RIVA 128. That basically saved the company in its earliest days. There have been a few moments like that in Nvidia's history where they've made a bet on this next thing that's going to happen and you're betting the farm and so far they've just managed to grow the farm. It's like big ag now. It's massive.Michael Calore: I want to ask Will a question about what a lot of people consider to be the birth of this modern era of AI, which Nvidia is a big part of. Can you tell us about what happened roughly 10, 12 years ago in the world of artificial intelligence computing?Will Knight: Yeah, sure. Nvidia's very much wound up in the origins of modern AI and we forget now because everything's machine learning based and AI algorithms so capable. But back before 2010, 2012, people were coding all these things by hand to try and have machines do more intelligent tasks. There was a group of people who focused on this neural network approach, which is totally out of vogue. It hadn't worked. It had been too puny to do anything very impressive and they kept going on it. Around 2010, there was this conference of enough data from the internet, these bigger neural network algorithms, which was possible to run on GPUs because they were very paralleled and the computations you want to do are inherently parallel.Those deep learning researchers figured out that they could supercharge their algorithms on GPUs. In 2012, there was this competition to try and see who could write an algorithm that could classify things in images best. The deep learning people suddenly blew everybody else out of the water and they were using GPUs to make that happen. It wasn't as if Nvidia really foresaw that, it was just that their chips happened to be perfect for that task, and then I think Jensen ran with it.Lauren Goode: And then there was another moment in 2017, Will, when Google put out its Transformer paper. That also was a pretty big catalyst for this new era of AI and Nvidia was a part of that, too.Will Knight: Right. Yeah. That Transformer paper was this new way to do machine learning on language especially and it was incredibly powerful. It turns out it's what's given us all these language models with their remarkable capabilities. In the run-up to that, it was a lot of image recognition, voice recognition, and Nvidia deserves a lot of credit for building these tools that loads of people were jumping on. When the Transformer stuff happened, it was the beginning of this generative AI language model chatbot era, where things really gathered a lot of steam and took off massively as we've seen.Michael Calore: Yes. Now, the industry is just exploding and you've got startups and large companies competing for computing power, right? Nvidia GPUs famously became very, very difficult to find for a few years. They were also used in bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency mining, so they were worth more than their weight in gold for a while. The company's still trying to recover from this supply chain issue. They're still trying to flood the world with chips, but the thing that it seems like, Lauren, from the talk that you had with Jensen that he's most focused on as far as hardware goes in the future, is doing this type of computing at scale, like doing data centers just for AI and very large appliances that companies buy to do their own AI computations on site.Lauren Goode: Yeah. The data center business is already a pretty big business for Nvidia, but when he and I first sat down in early January to talk about this, it was one of the first things he brought up. He had just gotten out of a meeting with a technology partner to talk about these AI data centers again. I think that the simplest way to describe this is that the whole computing industry has really moved from on-device computing to cloud computing. On-device is those old days of graphics cards jammed into your personal computer and most, if not all, of the accelerated computing is happening there. And then, with giant tech companies spinning up their cloud computing options like Google and Amazon, a lot of that computation has shifted to the cloud. Microsoft is a part of this, too. Your inputs go from your computer to a server somewhere and then the output comes back to your device. This is part of what enables software to, quote, unquote, \"scale\" so quickly. People in tech love using that word, VCs love it. Everyone loves scale.Michael Calore: Scale, that's where the money is.Lauren Goode: That's right. We must scale up. We might have to scale up WIRED these days. Nvidia is a part of that and now it plans to develop more of these AI supercomputing data centers that help power not just software companies but also manufacturers or self-driving cars or biotech companies that are starting to use more and more AI.Michael Calore: Nice.Will Knight: That AI factory answer I thought was really fascinating in your interview. I think it probably also reflects the fact that, as we've seen AI take off, a lot of the really key players in it that are doing the algorithms like Google, Meta, Microsoft have studied to build their own chips. One of the things that they can do that could potentially give them an advantage over or an edge over Nvidia is build \u2026 They already build these data centers, networking the chips altogether, and he also talked about that networking company. But I think the idea of building their own huge data center is very much optimizing the networking and all these capabilities.It reflects partly the fact that you have models that are so large that you need to network tens of thousands of chips as efficiently as you possibly can when it was inconceivable a decade ago. But I think it does show that he's very smart about preempting what could be a bit of a threat as well as the opportunity to deliver that AI to lots of different customers. The likes of Google are going to be trying to deliver that to those manufacturers and car makers and so on. I thought that AI factory thing was very interesting.Lauren Goode: Yeah. Will brings up a good point. The Mellanox acquisition for Nvidia was a pretty savvy one because it provided that networking technology at the chip level, but some of the companies that Will mentioned also have incredibly deep pockets and probably have the technical capabilities to do something similar, build something similar, and they're certainly trying. We should take a quick break and when we come back we'll talk about Nvidia's competition.[Break]Lauren Goode: Nvidia is at the top of the AI pile right now. Its supercomputing GPUs are in very high demand. It has built a solid moat around itself with this programming model, Cuda. It has those data centers we just talked about and it's making strategic investments in other smaller AI companies, but what's stopping another big tech company from doing this? In fact, others are \u2026 Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, they all have a lot of cash and grand plans to accelerate their AI computing efforts. Will, who do you think is the most formidable competitor to Nvidia? Maybe it's a company I haven't even named here.Will Knight: Well, I think the most obvious formidable competitor is Google because it's been developing its own AI chips for a while and it's obviously also a huge player in AI software. It's interesting what they're doing, because Nvidia might have the most powerful, most capable chips, but if you can network together several less powerful chips as if there's no \u2026 or if there's very minimal bottleneck between them, you can do things more impressively. Google's been focusing actually a lot of attention on that. It did a recent experiment where it showed it's possible to network 50,000 GPUs together to do language model training and usually you do 10,000. That bottleneck is really important.It basically increases the size of the overall supercomputer even if your chips are not quite as cutting edge or powerful. They've been doing a bunch of interesting stuff with their own optical networking between chips to try and speed that up. I think they're probably the one that's most in mind, but other companies like Microsoft is trying to develop its own AI chips. There are also a bunch of startups like Cerebras and even ones doing things in non-conventional. I think that could blindside, I guess, Nvidia at some point, but I think Google's the big one that Jensen's probably looking over his shoulder at.Lauren Goode: Yeah. I thought it was interesting that when Google announced its Gemini AI models, they left Nvidia of the announcement because they're now relying on it's TPU, its tensor processing units.Michael Calore: Really? I'm going to bet on AWS as the dark horse here, Amazon Web Services. Obviously, they've been working on this for a long time and they don't have as much to show for it, but I think that's holding their cards to lay them down at the right time.Lauren Goode: Interesting.Michael Calore: Yeah.Will Knight: There was a very interesting announcement where Anthropic, one of these competitors to OpenAI, which was founded by people from that company, got a huge investment from Amazon AWS. Part of that deal was that they were going to run their next model, their next competitor to GPT-4 or 5 on Amazon silicon. That will show that their silicon is competitive and that's going to be one of the ways they try and sell that to all their customers.Michael Calore: Yeah.Lauren Goode: Will, where do AMD and Intel fit into all of this?Will Knight: Yeah. I think AMD's come out recently with some chips that are more competitive and likely to be bit more of an option for people developing models. Intel \u2026 I mean, it is trying to get back into the game of making these but it's it very behind. But it's got a huge amount of money from the US government to try and improve what it's doing, so that could include making chips for Nvidia. They want to do that. They want to try and have this cutting edge process, but they're also looking to develop their own chips somewhere down the line. I think they're a long way off.Lauren Goode: They've been on a bit of a press blitz recently. You wrote about them in WIRED.com last week.Will Knight: Yeah. Well, they are receiving a huge \u2026 I mean, it's reported, but I think it's fair to say they're going to receive a huge injection of cash from the CHIPS Act. The US government is trying to make sure that America is competitive when it comes to making chips, because they're worried about the supply chain, what could happen if access to TSMC or Samsung was cut off. They're determined for them to make a comeback. Intel has started to produce chips that are much more close to TSMC. They've been following this really aggressive path and they announced that Microsoft is going to be making its AI chips on its platform. It remains to be seen how great a comeback they can make.Michael Calore: I'm curious about the other side of that. With the US government trying to support homegrown chip fabs and get more of this technology built in the United States, it also has put export controls on that technology so that we can't share our latest technological advancements with other countries, particularly with China. Can one of you explain how this is helping shape the industry?Lauren Goode: Well, I can answer for Nvidia and then maybe Will can go into a little bit more depth about the broader industry. But Nvidia has been affected by the export controls. These were first announced in August of 2022. There have since been some updates to the export controls, but basically Nvidia had to start making or tweaking its chips so that they were control compliant and they could still ship to China because China is, obviously, a very important market for Nvidia as it is for a lot of tech companies. But the goal here is that the US and other Western countries have the, quote, unquote, \"best technology\" access to the most advanced technology and that we're not just giving that technology away to China. Nvidia wanted to continue to sell in that market, but they had to change. It's tweaking the formula to make sure that they weren't selling the best stuff there. It's also affecting their data center business as well. Will, Do you have a sense of how that's affecting the broader chip industry?Will Knight: I think, it's one of the more fascinating moves in tech policy that the US government has made certainly in recent years, because they're basically cutting off one of the most lucrative and important industry's access to the biggest market and the fastest growing market to try and maintain this technological edge. People within the chip industry are quite worried, I think, rightly that China is going to simply encourage Chinese companies to be more competitive and to gain more of an edge. The whole rational is that it's so difficult to do chip making and all of the components and technologies and hardware you need come from American allies or America, so you can limit that. But there have been some recent moves to suggest that China may be moving more quickly in developing more cutting edge chips.Lauren Goode: Let me ask both of you guys a question. AI is so obviously imperfect, especially in the whole era of generative AI. Mistakes, hallucinations, biases, and that can be as inconsequential as it performs simple math wrong, like when we all know the answer to two plus two is four. Or it can be as consequential as a self-driving car not recognizing a human being that has fallen down in the road or it could be part of an erroneous drone strike. This is really, really serious stuff and I am wondering if the companies that are not just hardware makers but also platform companies and software makers \u2026 What happens around public sentiment of AI and those companies in particular when things go wrong? Nvidia has the ability to say right now, \"We're just the hardware maker. Yes, we have a platform that Cuda platform that all the developers are locked into, but we just make the hardware.\" If you're Google or Microsoft or Amazon and you really own that full stack of AI computing, what happens when things go wrong?Will Knight: Well, one of the things that you're alluding to is things can go wrong with machine learning systems in completely different ways, I think. A big question out there, say, in self-driving cars is how you determine where the error or the problem occurred. That can be quite difficult when you're using machine learning, which is inherently probabilistic, as well as code that follows certain rules or hardware that follows certain rules. If you could follow it back to a buggy element of a chip, I guess you could point the finger at them. But I think that that's one of the things that actually they're trying to work out in a lot of industries that are increasingly depending on AI is how you even determine where errors come from, how you figure out how reliable something is, which isn't a normal engineering, because dealing with these systems which don't actually behave the same way when you run them twice \u2026 So, you have to kind of engineer around that.Michael Calore: I have been tickled, amused by the fact that the revolution that we're seeing on the ground is a chatbot revolution. Everybody is very, very excited about chatbots, but I do think it's useful at looking how this is going to be adopted into society, because chatbots are very visceral. People have conversations with their phones, people have conversations with a customer service agent that may or may not be a human. People can interact with an AI version of their favorite celebrity in virtual reality. It's novel, it's kind of useful, and when it does the thing that you want it to do, then it feels like the future. It feels like magic. It feels like you just experienced what the future is going to look like. I think the big leap is going to be when we learn that some of the systems that oppress us, things like banking, admissions to colleges \u2026Lauren Goode: Housing, job applications, health care, yep.Michael Calore: Law enforcement. When those systems become more and more reliant on machine intelligence and we notice that the oppression is staying the same or getting worse and it is not really helping us, that our perception of these things are the future, cool, will change to, \"These things are the future. This sounds terrible.\" I don't really know what to say about hallucinations, because I think you really have to be embedded in the tools and really using the tools in order to see those smaller, more nuanced problems, and to gain an understanding of them in most people. By most people, I mean like 95 percent of the people out there are not deep in those tools and they're not super familiar with them, but they are encountering them whether they know it or not. I think the next couple of years are going to be wild.Lauren Goode: There's just so much potential for additional layers of obfuscation.Michael Calore: Yes.Lauren Goode: Not being able to actually pinpoint where the liability should.Michael Calore: Yes. Yes. Really, I think it's going to \u2026 People are going to get even more upset at tech companies and billionaires and all the things that they're upset about now.Lauren Goode: Does that upset you, Mike? I know you love billionaires.Michael Calore: I love them as people, yes. They're great people. I'm sure some of them.Will Knight: I've been thinking about this in the context of self-driving cars, because on the one hand I think it's really shocking that\u2014in some ways, it's really insane that they test these experimental vehicles on the roads with pedestrians who haven't signed up for it at all. But then on the other hand, 35,000 people die a year because of terrible human drivers. We haven't had any kind of public discourse about that. It's just being done by the companies that have the most money, but, I mean, it is a really interesting thing to think about how to weigh those things.Lauren Goode: It's interesting to think about the blind spots. I mean, one of the hardware companies that's powering self-driving cars, someone running one of the labs told me that they realized after they started deploying the cars, they hadn't tested for Halloween. Truly, they hadn't tested for when people are crossing the street on a dark night wearing all different kinds of costumes that might obfuscate them as human beings. They had to go back and test that.Michael Calore: Is it a pantomime horse with two humans or is it an actual horse with no humans?Lauren Goode: Right. Is that really Batman?Michael Calore: Yeah.Lauren Goode: All right. Well, we're not going to be able to answer all of these questions on this week's podcast, but hopefully we gave you a good primer on Nvidia and where it's going. Will, we very much appreciate you being a part of that. We're going to take another quick break and then come back with all of our recommendations.[Break]Lauren Goode: All right, Will. What is your recommendation?Will Knight: My recommendation is this application called WhisperKit, which is from a company called Argmax, which was founded by some Apple developers who left to do their own thing. I think it's appropriate because it's a good example of the importance of the edge. This isn't like sending yourself to the cloud. You can do quite advanced voice transcription, which is obviously important for journalists and other people on your computer using \u2026 They use some software that came from OpenAI, but they just optimized it very much for your own hardware. It's a good example of how \u2026 Maybe a lot of AI is also going to happen on the edge, as well as in the cloud.Lauren Goode: And what are you using it for?Will Knight: Recording everybody.[Lauren and Michael laugh]Michael Calore: Your own home speech recognition applications that you're running?Will Knight: Yeah, just all the time. I can just remember everything. I can just settle arguments by winding back the tape and playing what people said.Lauren Goode: How many arguments do you get into? Will, you don't strike me as argumentative.Will Knight: You'd be surprised, but, no, I don't really use that. I was using one of these cloud platforms for transcription, but I wanted something that wasn't \u2026 I kept running into the limit of how much I could record, which actually is very annoying and they're quite expensive. I figured it'd be interesting to play with this for transcribing interviews.Michael Calore: And pretty accurate?Will Knight: Yeah, it's pretty accurate. I use this thing called Whisper from OpenAI, which is pretty good. Yeah, you have to go back, make sure you're not misquoting people, but, yeah, pretty good.Lauren Goode: How secure is it? Would you use it to process your most sensitive interviews?Will Knight: Well, it's all running on my computer. Assuming my computer hasn't been hacked, which is never a given, it certainly seems more secure than sending it to the cloud.Lauren Goode: Interesting. Yeah. I use Google's transcription service, which is pretty darn good. It does it on device, but then I do send it to the cloud. Use Otter, right?Michael Calore: I use Mechanical Turk. No, I'm kidding. I use Alice.Lauren Goode: What's that?Michael Calore: Alice AI. It's another one of the front ends for \u2026 I think they use Google's transcription service. But also, I have a Pixel phone, so if I record on my Pixel phone then it just freely translates it.Lauren Goode: Right. My second phone's a pixel for all my shady activity.Michael Calore: Yep.Lauren Goode: Thank you for that, Will. We're going to link that in the show notes. Mike, what's your recommendation?Michael Calore: Get your garden ready. This is my recommendation. This week, February turns into March and in just a couple more weeks it will be spring. Spring will have sprung and it is time to plant the vegetables and the fruits and the flowers that you would like to be eating this summer. If you live in a slightly warmer part of the country like we do here in California, or if you live in the south, then you can start planting outdoors pretty much now or next week. If you live in a colder part, you will have to use a greenhouse or you can do like I did and get a seedling mat, which is like a heated mat that you put your seedlings on. You can leave them on your enclosed porch or in your basement or your attic and make sure that you can grow healthy plants.I, like many people, got into gardening a little bit more than usual during the pandemic because all of a sudden I had all this time at home that I could pay attention to the plants. Now that I'm in the office most of the days, my garden has gone into disarray. There's a lot of weeds. I've switched to succulents for most of it, but I am determined to do some California wildflowers this year and to do some peppers that we can all enjoy either fresh or pickled this summer. I would say that if you are a person who has always thought about gardening or if you used to be a serious gardener, this is a big reminder. It's a big flashing light sign that now is the time to plant again.Lauren Goode: This is a great recommendation.Michael Calore: Thank you. Are you going to plant anything?Lauren Goode: I have already started with the plants. I recently picked up some dichondra silver, some lotus. I have Angel vine going pretty strong right now under our skylights in the kitchen.Michael Calore: Can you eat any of these things?Lauren Goode: No, but I have one plant \u2026 You know this plant, Kevin. It was rescued from a demolition site during the pandemic. My neighbor gave me this scrawny little thing in a pot and it\u2019s a lemon tree. And I grew it. I mean, it's really healthy now. It's attached to a lattice and, yeah, I water it, I give it plant food. It provided a lot of lemons last year and I'm already seeing... The green ones are there now. What is that called when it's not ripe? Unripe. Yeah. Kevin the Lemon Tree is doing \u2026 Actually, our friend Cyra and Adrian named it when they were drunk one night like, \"OK, it's Kevin.\" Kevin's doing great. Everyone come over for lemons.Michael Calore: Nice.Lauren Goode: But, yeah, no, I love it. It's great. There are some other plant. There's a Japanese maple in front of my place, but I don't have to water that or anything. The Japanese maple houses the little nest from the hummingbirds last year.Michael Calore: OK. Lauren, I just have to point out that all these things that you're mentioning are plants and trees.Lauren Goode: I know. I know. But you're talking about planting. They are plants. You plant plants.Michael Calore: This year, try herbs, charred, leafy greens, peppers. Get them going.Lauren Goode: OK. My brother actually got me an herb garden from Christmas and I sent it back.Michael Calore: Is it like one of the Click & Grow ones?Lauren Goode: Yeah, it was like one of those indoor ones and I didn't want it inside, but maybe I'll do it outside.Michael Calore: Does your brother listen to the show and will now be offended?Lauren Goode: He does. Hi, Gerald. Yeah, he does. He listened to the... Yes, he listened to the episode where we're talking about the Bono book.Michael Calore: Oh, yes, yes.Lauren Goode: Yeah. YeahMichael Calore: OK. Another gift that you returned?Lauren Goode: Yeah.Michael Calore: Before we go too far into plantasia, what is your recommendation?Lauren Goode: Plantasia?Michael Calore: What is your recommendation?Lauren Goode: My recommendation is a book that is soon spawning a television show. Although I did just look it up, I thought the TV show was coming out soon and there's no release date for it yet. It's later in 2024. The book is called Say Nothing. It's by our colleague at The New Yorker, Patrick Radden Keefe. Mike is smiling right now because we were saying earlier how saying the phrase my colleague can be so self-aggrandizing because I don't actually know Patrick Radden Keefe. I admire his writing, a great deal.Michael Calore: He used to write for WIRED.Lauren Goode: I read more than one of his books. You told me that this morning and I was very excited. He worked \u2026 What is it called, Danger Zone?Michael Calore: Danger Room. It was our defense tech section.Lauren Goode: Yeah. How long ago was this?Michael Calore: I don't know. 2008, 2009 probably.Lauren Goode: I mean, he's in our Slack and we're talking about him right now, but I've never met him. I think his writing is brilliant. I've read at least a couple of his books. Say Nothing is about the Troubles in Ireland and it's multiple stories interwoven. It's one of the best books I've read in 2023 by far. I read it towards the end of the year, so it's still fresh in the brain. It came out sooner, though, I think 2019, and now has been turned into a television show. It has been snapped up by FX. Here in the United States, it's going to be airing on Hulu at some point this year. We don't know when though, so keep an eye out for that. In the meantime, read the book.Michael Calore: Nice.Lauren Goode: That's great.Michael Calore: Nice.Lauren Goode: Our colleague, by our colleague. All right. That's our show this week. Will, thank you so much for joining us.Will Knight: Thanks for having me.Lauren Goode: And thanks to all of you for listening. If you have feedback, you can find all of us on the site formerly known as Twitter. Worst name change ever.Michael Calore: Bluesky.Lauren Goode: Bluesky, that's right. Just check the show notes.

He was inspired to start his own company after a long day of trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to pick out a sofa.\nThe experience illuminated how the luxury home-goods industry has traditionally lagged in adopting digital technologies, especially those for creating immersive, interactive experiences for consumers.\nGay founded Mode Maison, a member of the\u00a0NVIDIA Inception program, in 2018 with the goal of solving this challenge and paving the way for scalability, creativity and a generative future in retail. Using the Universal Scene Description framework, aka OpenUSD, and the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, Gay, along with Mode Maison Chief Technology Officer Jakub Cech and the Mode Maison team, are helping enhance and digitalize entire product lifecycle processes \u2014 from design and manufacturing to consumer experiences.\n\nThey developed a photometric scanning system, called Total Material Appearance Capture, which offers an unbiased, physically based approach to digitizing the material world that\u2019s enabled by real-world embedded sensors.\nTMAC captures proprietary data and the composition of any material, then turns it into input that serves as a single source of truth, which can be used for creating a fully digitized retail model. Using the system, along with OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse, Mode Maison customers can create highly accurate digital twins of any material or product.\n\u201cBy enabling this, we\u2019re effectively collapsing and fostering a complete integration across the entire product lifecycle process \u2014 from design and production to manufacturing to consumer experiences and beyond,\u201d said Gay.\nMode Maison developed a photometric scanning system called Total Material Appearance Capture.\nStreamlining Workflows and Enhancing Productivity With Digital Twins\nPreviously, Mode Maison faced significant challenges in creating physically based, highly flexible and scalable digital materials. The limitations were particularly noticeable when rendering complex materials and textures, or integrating digital models into cohesive, multilayered environments.\nUsing Omniverse helped Gay and his team overcome these challenges by offering advanced rendering capabilities, physics simulations and extensibility for AI training that unlock new possibilities in digital retail.\n\nBefore using Omniverse and OpenUSD, Mode Maison used disjointed processes for digital material capture, modeling and rendering, often leading to inconsistencies, the inability to scale and minimal interoperability. After integrating Omniverse, the company experienced a streamlined, coherent workflow where high-fidelity digital twins can be created with greater efficiency and interoperability.\nThe team primarily uses Autodesk 3ds Max for design, and they import the 3D data using Omniverse Connectors. Gay says OpenUSD is playing an increasingly critical role in its workflows, especially when developing composable, flexible, interoperable capabilities across asset creation.\nThis enhanced pipeline starts with capturing high-fidelity material data using TMAC. The data is then processed and formatted into OpenUSD for the creation of physically based, scientifically accurate, high-fidelity digital twins.\n\u201cOpenUSD allows for an unprecedented level of collaboration and interoperability in creating complex, multi-layered capabilities and advanced digital materials,\u201d Gay said. \u201cIts ability to seamlessly integrate diverse digital assets and maintain their fidelity across various applications is instrumental in creating realistic, interactive digital twins for retail.\u201d\n\nOpenUSD and Omniverse have sped Mode Maison and their clients\u2019 ability to bring products to market, reduced costs associated with building and modifying digital twins, and enhanced productivity through streamlined creation.\n\u201cOur work represents a major step toward a future where digital and physical realities will be seamlessly integrated,\u201d said Gay. \u201cThis shift enhances consumer engagement and paves the way for more sustainable business practices by reducing the need for physical prototyping while enabling more precise manufacturing.\u201d\nAs for emerging technological advancements in digital retail, Gay says AI will play a central role in creating hyper-personalized design, production, sourcing and front-end consumer experiences \u2014 all while reducing carbon footprints and paving the way for a more sustainable future in retail.\nJoin In on the Creation\nAnyone can build their own Omniverse extension or Connector to enhance 3D workflows and tools.\nLearn more about how OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse are transforming industries at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference running March 18-21, online and at the San Jose Convention Center.\nJoin OpenUSD Day at GTC on Tuesday, March 19, to learn more about building generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines and tools using USD.\nGet started with NVIDIA Omniverse by downloading the standard license free, access OpenUSD resources, and learn how Omniverse Enterprise can connect your team.

At the time, Nvidia was at a market cap of $550 billion compared to Apple\u2019s $2.5 trillion market cap. In the Forbes editorial \u201cHere\u2019s Why Nvidia Will Surpass Apple in 5 Years\u201d I wrote the following:\n\n\u201cNotably, the stock is up 335% since my thesis was first published [my first AI thesis in 2018]\n\n \u2013 a notable amount for a mega cap stock and nearly 2-3X more returns than any FAAMG in the same period. This is important because I expect this trend to continue until Nvidia has surpassed all FAAMG valuations.\u201d published August 2021\n\nTAIPEI, TAIWAN - 2023/05/29: Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang enters the stage while waving to ...

The company has surpassed Amazon, Google, Tesla, Meta and Netflix. The only one left standing is Apple and we have 2.5 years left to make good on my prediction.\n\n\nNotice I did not say at the time that Nvidia would double its market cap to $1 trillion or surpass one of the FAANGs. Instead, I predicted that Nvidia would surpass the world\u2019s most valuable company to take the throne, and would do it very quickly.\nHere\u2019s what Nvidia\u2019s increase in market cap looks like:Since November 2018, Nvidia's market cap has increased more than 1,500%, compared to the FAANG's ... [+] gaining 100% to 280%.Source: YCharts\n\nMORE FOR YOUFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users\u2014Do Not Use These Websites\u2018The White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Has Turned Out To Be BadTesla Stock Slides Another 6% As More Firms Warn Of Musk-Led Company\u2019s \u2018Sales Woes\u2019\nHow Nvidia Surpassed Many FAANGs \u2014 and why Apple is Next\nNvidia\u2019s rapid rise to become one of the top five most valuable companies in the world stems from its leadership position at the forefront of AI \u2014- which began with the A100. It was the A100 which combined training and inference that kicked off Nvidia\u2019s strength in the data center \u2013the H100 would come a couple of years later. The A100 left early breadcrumbs that Nvidia would see a glorious ascent to overtake Apple. Prior to the A100, there were additional clues, specifically Nvidia\u2019s CUDA software platform, which my firm also made quite clear in 2018 would carve a deep moat for a near-monopoly.\n\nRapid top-line growth is the primary eye-catching statistic, as no other companies in tech have reported such blistering revenue growth at a rate above 200% for multiple quarters at an annualized revenue rate near $90 billion. These are growth rates we see in small caps or mid-caps that have a mere $1 billion or less in revenue. Rarely, if ever, do we see this growth rate above $5 billion in revenue let alone $90 billion.\n\n\nThe consistency and magnitude of the top-line beats is impressive, however, it\u2019s the growth further down the income statement where Nvidia\u2019s report truly shines. Nvidia\u2019s stronghold grip on the data center market at the moment combined with pricing power and elevated demand for its H100 GPU has allowed substantial growth in operating income and has generated robust earnings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look as to why Nvidia has been able to surpass every FAANG except Apple, and why it\u2019s inevitable that Nvidia becomes the World\u2019s Most Valuable company in the next 2.5 years. We are using the date of August 2021 through the Q4 January report to evaluate the fundamental growth since that is when we first predicted Nvidia would surpass Apple\u2019s valuation by August of 2026.\nHere are some staggering data points since that prediction:\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center:\n\u00b7 Data center revenue has grown more than 676%, from $2.37 billion in fiscal Q2 2022 to $18.40 billion in fiscal Q4 2024.\n\u00b7 In just 10 quarters, Nvidia has taken the data center from a less than $10 billion annualized run rate to almost a $75 billion annualized run rate \u2013 no other company can boast growth at this scale. For context, Amazon\u2019s AWS increased from a $12 billion annualized rate to $35 billion over 12 quarters from 2016 to 2019, but took six years to surpass $80 billion in 2022. Nvidia did the equivalent in 2.5 years.\n\u00b7 Data center revenues in Q4 accelerated again, growing 409% YoY compared to 279% YoY in Q3 and 171% YoY in Q1. Nvidia attributed Q4\u2019s growth to \u201chigher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform\u201d alongside strong demand for InfiniBand which was up 5-fold.\nTo put in perspective just how rapid this ascent in data center revenues has been, this year\u2019s $47.5 billion in revenue is 18% more than total revenues in the segment for the past five years combined. Nvidia generated a total of $40.2 billion in data center revenue between CY17 through CY22.Nvidia's data center revenue increased 409% YoY to $18.40 billion in Q4, compared to $2.37 billion ... [+] in August 2021.Source: Nvidia\nCompare this to Apple\u2019s prized iPhone segment since our prediction:\n\u00b7 iPhone revenue increased 79% from $38.8 billion in fiscal Q4 2021 to $69.7 billion in fiscal Q1 2024; however, iPhone sales have increased just 12.7% to $43.8 billion in Q4 2023.\n\u00b7 iPhone revenue increased just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2023, from almost $192 billion to $200 billion, as growth has stagnated.\nOverall Revenue Growth for Nvidia of 240% Compared to Apple\u2019s 43%:\nSince August 2021, Nvidia\u2019s revenue has grown at a much quicker rate than Apple, at a 240% total increase compared to 43% for Apple. That\u2019s 96% growth on average for Nvidia per year and 17% growth for Apple averaged out per year \u2013 a 5.5X difference.\nThe iPhone\u2019s installed base is reaching 1.5 billion and the market is showing signs of saturation. Growth stems primarily from existing devices being upgraded rather than building out the ecosystem. For data centers, we\u2019re in the very early stages of growth, with Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang predicting that $1 trillion will be spent across the next four years to upgrade data centers for AI, with a majority of this spend stemming from hyperscalers and cloud providers procuring GPUs.\nThis massive capital spending on data centers is what will help Nvidia hammer the nail in the coffin to overtake Apple, as it will continue to drive significant growth in Nvidia\u2019s data center revenues and thus overall revenue.\nQ1\u2019s revenue guide of $24 billion implies YoY growth of 235%, and suggests data center revenue may surpass $20 billion next quarter, for another blazing hot quarter with DC growth of 367% YoY.\nLooking forward through the rest of FY25, estimates on the Street for data center revenue range from $22.8 billion to $36.4 billion by fiscal Q4 2025, with total revenue ranging between $25.7 billion to $40.3 billion.\nShould Nvidia reach $29 billion in overall revenue by next January with $25 billion in data center, its data center revenue will have grown more than 950% since August 2021 with total revenue up nearly 350%. Compare this to Apple, where revenues are expected to decline (4.1%) YoY next quarter and increase just over 1% for fiscal 2024.\nNvidia has Strong Margins, But Apple Has the Cash\nNvidia\u2019s margins are much stronger than Apple\u2019s, but Apple leads in cash and cash generation.\nSince August 2021, Nvidia\u2019s gross margin has expanded significantly, from 66.7% to 76.7% in fiscal Q4, first topping 70% in fiscal Q2 and expanding since then as a high degree of pricing power for its ultra popular H100 GPUs is aiding margin growth.\nApple has similarly seen gross margin expansion, stemming primarily from growth in high-margin Services revenue as opposed to hardware sales \u2014 Apple\u2019s gross margin increased from 42.2% to 45.8% over the same period.\nNvidia\u2019s operating margin has improved tremendously in fiscal 2024, as it managed to increase operating expenses by only 2% YoY while driving a 126% increase in revenue. Operating margin has increased from 47.2% to 66.7% since our prediction. Over the past two quarters, operating margin has increased 910 bp.\nOn the other hand, Apple\u2019s operating margin has improved 520 bp over the same period, from 28.5% to 33.7% \u2014 Nvidia\u2019s operating margin is now nearly double Apple\u2019s.\nBecause of this major increase in operating leverage, Nvidia has seen substantial growth in EPS. Nvidia reported $5.16 in EPS in fiscal Q4, nearly 400% growth from $1.04 reported in August 2021. Apple\u2019s earnings growth over the same period has been just 14%, from $5.62 to $6.42 on a TTM basis.\nHowever, Apple has the cash and cash flows, though Nvidia is quickly improving in both metrics. Apple\u2019s cash on hand totals $172.6 billion, with over $72 billion in current cash, equivalents and marketable securities.\nNvidia has just $26 billion in cash and equivalents, an increase from $18.3 billion in Q3 and $13.3 billion in the year ago quarter as Nvidia is pocketing more cash.\nApple leads the Mag 7 and tech in general as it generates the highest levels of operating cash flow and free cash flow. TTM operating cash flow was more than $116 billion, while FCF was more than $106 billion, or a FCF margin of 27.5%.\nNvidia\u2019s operating cash flow grew 400% YoY to $28.1 billion, with FCF up 690% YoY to $27 billion. Nvidia\u2019s margins here are now stronger than Apple\u2019s, at 46% and 44%, but the scale of its revenues means it has a few more years to go before it can surpass the $100 billion threshold on cash.\nWhile cash flows may nearly double to ~$50 billion in FY25, Nvidia\u2019s software can complement this growth as it scales a few years in the future, much as Services is aiding Apple\u2019s growth and margins.\nHow Nvidia Will Surpass Apple\u2019s Valuation\nBefore we go into a few reasons Nvidia has a long runway, it\u2019s prudent to state that Nvidia has likely peaked in revenue growth (for now) either this quarter or next quarter. For revenue to peak next quarter, Nvidia has to beat by $2.2 billion or more.\nNvidia's revenue growth rates have peaked for now at 265% in Q4, when compared to growth rates in ... [+] H2.Source: Nvidia, Seeking Alpha\nNvidia\u2019s post-earnings rally has taken it above a $2T valuation, as it continues to quickly close the gap with Apple. Here\u2019s the path to Nvidia re-accelerating again sometime over the next 2.5 years to finish off Apple once and for all.\nSoftware Opportunity\nAMD\u2019s CEO Lisa Su believes the AI accelerator market can reach $400 billion by 2027, as demand continues to far outpace supply with cloud giants gobbling up GPUs as fast as possible. With accelerators alone, Nvidia can surpass Apple as the company is estimated to control at least 90% of the data center GPU market. Even if Nvidia\u2019s share slips to approximately 80% by 2027, that would be $320 billion in revenue.\nLooking beyond accelerators, Nvidia\u2019s software opportunity is a main factor in our thesis \u2013 that Nvidia will not only be the primary player for AI hardware, but simultaneously will become a predominant player for AI software. Software is the holy grail for a hardware company, especially for Nvidia; if competitors such as AMD can compete on performance and undercut on price, driving GPU prices lower over the long run, software will let Nvidia monetize its existing GPU base and generate streams of recurring revenue.\nRight now, software is at a $1 billion run rate and CEO Jensen Huang stated that there is a \u201cfundamental reason why Nvidia will be very successful in software\u201d which is that it\u2019s fundamentally required for accelerated computing and will be needed to open new markets. Nvidia\u2019s Enterprise AI will \u201cdo the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed base optimization for all of their software stacks\u201d at about $4,500 per GPU.\nThis is key as Nvidia\u2019s current analyst estimates do not take into account that AI software will ramp over the next two to three years. At max adoption, the software opportunity would be worth $11.2 billion but a more conservative scenario would be $5 billion. This may seem like peanuts compared to the $18.4 billion in data center revenue today but it will be accretive to margins and accelerate YoY whereas the data center may come under pricing pressure. To put it simply, we all know semis are cyclical and software is not \u2013 where those two meet will create fortuitous crossroads.\nAccelerated Product Roadmap\nIn terms of hardware, Nvidia has an ambitious AI GPU roadmap, and is expected to release the next-gen H200 and B100 GPUs later this year, just over one year after releasing the H100. The two GPUs are expected to offer another leap in performance for AI training and inference, and the H200 is already in demand by the leading CSPs \u2013 AWS will be the first to deploy the new GPU, but Microsoft, Google and Oracle will also be deploying the chips.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the cloud giants are eager to upgrade quickly \u2014 Nvidia says the H200 will boast reduced energy usage and thus a lower TCO, while the introduction of HBM3e memory will essentially supercharge the GPU\u2019s performance. For GPT-3 175B, the H200 is expected to offer 1.4x to 1.9x faster LLM inference on the leading GPT and Llama models compared to the H100, and an 18x performance upgrade compared to the A100.For GPT-3 175B, the H200 is expected to offer 1.4x to 1.9x faster LLM inference on the leading GPT ... [+] and Llama models compared to the H100, and an 18x performance upgrade compared to the A100.Source: Nvidia\nWhile it will be too soon to gauge what level of demand there is for the two new GPUs from a Q1 guide, a fiscal year guide could provide insight into whether demand for the H200 and B100 can match the H100, or if Nvidia will face initial supply constraints while ramping production. Additionally, Nvidia will face competition this year from AMD\u2019s MI300s.\nNote on Automotive:\nAutomotive is another large, incoming segment for Nvidia with a $300 billion total addressable market by 2030. Nvidia has an enviable position with a lead across dozens of OEMs in the US and China. Nvidia\u2019s automotive suite spans nearly the entire tech stack of the car: its Drive SoCs \u2013 Orin and Thor \u2013 serve as the central computer for the vehicle, enabling OEMs to move higher up the semi-autonomous capability curve, from L2 to L2+/L3, to localized L4, and potentially L5 in the future.\nNvidia\u2019s entire autonomous platform, called Hyperion, has not fully hit the market yet \u2013 Hyperion 8 is expected to begin shipping this year with Hyperion 9 following in 2026. Automotive\u2019s pipeline currently sits at just $11 billion, but the shift to predominantly L2+ architectures as OEMs compete on tech and ADAS features beckons to dramatically increase this pipeline.\nValuation Eerily Low Despite 420% Rally Since 2023\nFundamentally, the rapid bottom line growth has supported this massive valuation increase \u2013 rarely do you see EPS increase 1,200% over two fiscal years at a multibillion-dollar scale. Compare this to Apple, which is expected to see just 17% total growth in EPS over the next two years.\nAs discussed in our pre-earnings writeup, the valuation is eerily low still and it is very unusual for a stock to be up more than 400% in just over year and yet be cheaper than it was at its bottom (Oct 2022 for Nvidia) \u2013 and that\u2019s still the case after Thursday\u2019s surge.Nvidia\u2019s forward PE ratio is slightly above 32x, which compares to a forward PE ratio of more than ... [+] 75x in its November 2021 peak and 34x when shares bottomed in the $115 range.Source: YCharts\nNvidia\u2019s forward PE ratio is just above 32x at Friday\u2019s close, which compares to a forward PE ratio of more than 75x in its November 2021 peak, nearly 90x in March 2022, and 34x when shares bottomed in the $115 range. The valuation is what makes it a buy on any dips. However, we also won\u2019t be shy about taking gains if we reach predefined price targets. We have one in mind for Nvidia, so let\u2019s see if we get there for our next trim.\nConclusion:\nMy firm was the defacto pioneer on building an AI-focused portfolio with Nvidia at the helm, and we were bold and quite clear at a time that Nvidia would rival Apple\u2019s valuation when the very thought was inconceivable. There are many Nvidia bulls appearing today, where were they when the stock sold off (-60%) and was at the October 2022 low. I know where the I/O Fund was \u2014- writing editorials that clearly stated the stock was bottoming and issuing 10 buy alerts to our premium research members when the stock was under $210.\nOne of the more critical media appearances was on Real Vision, when I stated that it would take World War 3 for me to sell my Nvidia position. The stock is up 400% since that show.\nNote, I did not say it would take World War 3 for me to take gains. We are not shy about putting real money into the bank if we think we can get a stock lower than where it currently trades. After all, we have been trimming Nvidia and buying lower for six years for a higher return than a buy and hold strategy. For example, entries at $210 creates returns of 281% to 627% with our lowest tranche at $108 versus 162% returns since January 1st, 2022.\nThe very mission we are on is to help readers safely participate in the life-changing gains that tech can offer. We want it all \u2014 put money in the bank, lock-in gains, yet also hold high-conviction stocks for the long haul at a high allocation (and hedge if tech falls out of favor).\nIf you own Nvidia stock, or are looking to own NVDA, we encourage you to attend our weekly premium webinars, held every Thursday at 4:30 pm EST. Next week, we will discuss our plan following NVDA\u2019s earnings, as well as a handful of other AI plays for 2024 \u2013 what our targets are, where we plan to buy as well as take gains.

Most Read from Bloomberg BYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Stock Rally Stalls at Start of Data-Packed Week: Markets Wrap Freddie Mercury\u2019s London Residence Lists at \u00a330 Million Jacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87 Poland\u2019s Famously Frank Top Diplomat Lands a Blow With Rebuff of Russia   Revenue in the current period will be about $24 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted $21.9 billion on average. Results in the fourth quarter also sailed past Wall Street estimates. The outlook extends a streak of Nvidia shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its artificial intelligence accelerators \u2014 highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on simple prompts. \u201cAccelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in the statement. \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d The shares jumped 16% to $785.38 as the close Thursday in New York, a record high and the biggest single-day increase since May. Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization has now increased by more than $650 billion this year \u2014 bringing its valuation to $1.89 trillion \u2014 as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.  That turned Wednesday\u2019s report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the numbers \u2014 along with the upbeat tone from Huang \u2014 renewed confidence that spending will stay strong. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. \u2014 three other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth \u2014 also gained on Thursday. \u201cThe entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note. Guidance was strong enough to \u201cdemonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside through the second half.\u201d New Cycle On a conference call with analysts, Huang said that demand for Nvidia\u2019s newest products will continue to outstrip supply for the rest of the year. Though supply is growing, demand isn\u2019t showing any signs of slowing, he said. \u201cGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle,\u201d Huang said. That will lead to a doubling of the world\u2019s data center installed base over the next five years and \u201crepresent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions,\u201d he said.   Story Continues Nvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company\u2019s H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as many as possible.Companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are Nvidia\u2019s largest customers, accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.In the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan 28, Nvidia\u2019s revenue more than tripled to $22.1 billion. Profit excluding certain items was $5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $20.4 billion and earnings of $4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn\u2019t generate that much revenue in an entire year.Nvidia\u2019s data center division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $18.4 billion of revenue, up 409% from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $2.87 billion of sales.Nvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-center companies. Huang, 61, has traveled the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems \u2014 both to protect their data and gain a competitive advantage.Nvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems Inc. earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of that deal, Cisco, the world\u2019s biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.Read More: Nvidia, Cisco to Help Companies Build In-House AI ComputingBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI chips.AMD recently began selling a line of accelerators called the MI300. It expects to get revenue of $3.5 billion from that product this year, up from an earlier projection of $2 billion. Nvidia isn\u2019t standing still, though. Analysts expect the company to soon unveil more powerful accelerators.Nvidia also has had to navigate new export rules for chips headed to China, the largest market for semiconductors. The company has scaled down the capabilities of its products in order to continue to sell to that region, which in the past has accounted for a quarter of revenue. Three months ago, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that the company\u2019s projections would have been higher if it weren\u2019t for the China rules.In terms of data center revenue, China accounted for a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter,\u201d Kress said Wednesday.The company has begun sending samples of new chips that are compliant with restrictions to Chinese customers, Huang said. That should help business pick up again.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,\u201d Huang said.(Updates with closing shares in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations The High Cost of Eating Out in America Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

Photograph: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 1 year oldExplainerWhy has Nvidia driven stock markets to record highs?This article is more than 1 year oldWhat you need to know about the company, its importance to AI and whether the stock market boom is sustainableDan Milmo and Phillip InmanFri 23 Feb 2024 16.39 GMTLast modified on Thu 13 Jun 2024 20.02 BSTShareInvestor excitement over artificial intelligence reached a new peak this week when better-than-expected results from chipmaker Nvidia drove stock markets in three continents to record highs.The rally began on Thursday and continued into Friday, as Nvidia overtook Google\u2019s parent group, Alphabet, to become the third most valuable company in the US. Its market capitalisation hit $2tn (\u00a31.58tn), surpassed only by Microsoft and Apple.The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has raised many questions, not least over safety and the impact on jobs, but there are also concerns that it might be driving unsustainable market exuberance. Here we look at the latest share price rise and whether it can be maintained.What does Nvidia do and why is it important to AI?Nvidia makes the chips that are crucial to training and operating AI systems \u2013 they can carry out the immense data crunching required for tools like chatbots very quickly \u2013 and the demand for this crucial infrastructure is soaring as big tech firms join the AI race and make products such as ChatGPT that people want to use.If Nvidia is reporting strong demand for its products, then it is a clear sign that demand for the technology is thriving \u2013 and investors will inevitably follow.On Wednesday, the US-based firm surprised markets with the strength of its fourth-quarter earnings. It posted revenues of $22.1bn \u2013 against expectations of $20.6bn \u2013 and then forecast revenue growth of 233% in the current quarter, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of 208%.Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for generative AI \u2013 technology that immediately produces convincing text, images and audio from simple typed prompts \u2013 had reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d.How did markets react?Several leading indices have started the year strongly and reached fresh highs after the Nvidia results. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s main stock market index, the Nikkei, increased 2.19% to close at 39,098.68 in Tokyo \u2013 the highest it has been in 34 years.Over the longer term, other factors have boosted the Nikkei, including capital fleeing troubled waters in China and a fall in the value of the yen, but Nvidia\u2019s results had a knock-on effect around the world.Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 and Wall Street\u2019s blue chip Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices all reached new highs. Nvidia was a big beneficiary too, of course, posting the biggest ever single-day increase in the value of a listed company as its worth rose by $277bn.Graph showing Euro Stoxx 600 index performance over past five yearsOne investment argument is that strong demand for Nvidia GPUs \u2013 or graphics processing units, the company\u2019s key AI-friendly product \u2013 will ripple out across economies as demand for AI-related infrastructure and services increases.\u201cNvidia and the golden GPUs are the start of the spending wave, not the end and now Wall Street awaits as a myriad of use cases get built out across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst at US financial firm Wedbush Securities.For instance, tech research firm Gartner forecasts that global spending on AI software will grow from $124bn in 2022 to $297bn in 2027.There is also a belief that AI will increase productivity, or produce higher economic growth at a lower cost, with the accompanying fear that those lower costs are due to fewer jobs as AI systems render human roles obsolete.According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could boost US GDP by 0.4 percentage points and by 0.3 points in other developed markets over the next 10 years.How much is AI behind the stock market increases?It has played a significant role in continuing to boost the big tech stocks, which play such an outsize role in US markets alone. This week Deutsche Bank pointed out that tech stocks were playing an ever-bigger role in the S&P 500, the biggest US index. The bank pointed out that Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, account for almost a quarter of the value of the S&P 500.\u201cThe US equity market is rivalling 2000 and 1929 in terms of being its most concentrated in history,\u201d wrote Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of global economics and thematic research.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For instance, Amazon and Microsoft own cloud computing businesses that are crucial to developing and operating AI models (Microsoft is also a big investor in ChatGPT developer OpenAI), while Apple\u2019s shares were boosted recently by a bank report predicting new AI features embedded in its phones will increase demand.Is the AI stock market boom sustainable?The excitement around AI breakthroughs continues, with OpenAI revealing the remarkable-looking Sora video generation tool last week and Google releasing an upgrade to its Gemini model. Nvidia\u2019s optimistic sales forecasts also indicate an ongoing increase in demand for AI-related infrastructure.Deutsche Bank\u2019s Reid states that there are arguments \u201cfor and against\u201d the continued dominance of the Mag 7.In their favour, he argues that AI is \u201cjust in its infancy\u201d and the companies have room to grow due to their global reach. Factors against them include regulators launching antitrust actions and no one really knowing how AI will pan out and who will win.Neil Wilson, chief analyst at brokerage firm Finalto, says this is a bubble \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s the nature of markets, it\u2019s built into them to produce these manias\u201d \u2013 and the question is when and how it levels off.\u201cDoes the levelling off see a bust phase or can it glide gently down, which stocks are overvalued now and which are not, and I guess crucially from the wider perspective, does it herald a new era of productivity boom which sees multiples expand for almost all equities?\u201dAre there broader economic factors at play in the stock market rise?Stock markets have rallied in recent weeks, reflecting an easing of tensions that not so long ago appeared ready to wreck a global economic recovery.The Gaza conflict is a humanitarian disaster, but for the time being, ships laden with oil and gas are reaching their destinations, allowing the oil price to stabilise and the gas price to tumble back towards pre-pandemic levels.Low and stable energy prices are the bedrock of any recovery along with low interest rates, and central banks have signalled they will begin to make cuts in the second half of this year after a steep fall in inflation.Even Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock market \u2013 held back for decades by low growth while the country coped with an ageing population \u2013 joined New York\u2019s S&P 500 and German DAX indexes in reaching a record high.What could bring the rally to a halt?The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could escalate further, sparking a resurgence of shortages of energy, food and raw materials. The result will be a return to high inflation, which again could dent spending and confidence.Even without a global downturn, stock market investors may panic if they believe financial assets have become overpriced.It has been 16 years since the great financial crash of 2008, and many economists believe that the best efforts of regulators to prevent excessive speculation across the board during that time will not be enough to prevent another 2008-style wipeout.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingNvidiaexplainersShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyNvidia shares slump amid reports US is ramping up antitrust investigation4 Sept 2024Nvidia shares fall on slowing growth and production concerns29 Aug 2024Nvidia rides big tech\u2019s AI investment to beat Wall Street\u2019s sky-high expectations28 Aug 2024Why have the big seven tech companies been hit by AI boom doubts?3 Aug 2024Can AI boom drive Nvidia to a $4tn valuation despite investor doubt?2 Jul 2024Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia investigated over monopoly laws6 Jun 2024Nvidia: what\u2019s so good about the tech firm\u2019s new AI superchip?19 Mar 2024US orders immediate halt to some AI chip exports to China, says Nvidia25 Oct 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Earnings are off the charts. WIRED probes the mind of its CEO, Jensen Huang.FacebookXEmailSave StoryPhotograph: Ryan YoungSave this storySaveSave this storySaveTalking to Jensen Huang should come with a warning label. The Nvidia CEO is so invested in where AI is headed that, after nearly 90 minutes of spirited conversation, I came away convinced the future will be a neural net nirvana. I could see it all: a robot renaissance, medical godsends, self-driving cars, chatbots that remember. The buildings on the company\u2019s Santa Clara campus weren\u2019t helping. Wherever my eyes landed I saw triangles within triangles, the shape that helped make Nvidia its first fortunes. No wonder I got sucked into a fractal vortex. I had been Jensen-pilled.Huang is the man of the hour. The year. Maybe even the decade. Tech companies literally can\u2019t get enough of Nvidia\u2019s supercomputing GPUs. This is not the Nvidia of old, the supplier of Gen X video game graphics cards that made images come to life by efficiently rendering zillions of triangles. This is the Nvidia whose hardware has ushered in a world where we talk to computers, they talk back to us, and eventually, depending on which technologist you talk to, they overtake us.For our meeting, Huang, who is now 61, showed up in his trademark leather jacket and minimalist black sneakers. He told me on that Monday morning that he hates Monday mornings, because he works all day Sunday and starts the official work week already tired. Not that you\u2019d know it. Two days later, I attended a health care investment symposium\u2014so many biotech nerds, so many blazers\u2014and there onstage was Huang, energetic as ever.\u201cThis is not my normal crowd. Biologists and scientists, it\u2019s such an angry crowd,\u201d Huang said into a microphone, eliciting laughter. \u201cWe use words like creation and improve and accelerate, and you use words like target and inhibit.\u201d He worked his way up to his pitch: \u201cIf you want to do your drug design, your drug discovery, in silicon, it is very likely that you\u2019ll have to process an enormous amount of data. If you\u2019re having a hard time with computation of artificial intelligence, you know, just send us an email.\u201dHuang has made a pattern of positioning Nvidia in front of every big tech trend. In 2012 a small group of researchers released a groundbreaking image recognition system, called AlexNet, that used GPUs, instead of CPUs, to crunch its code and launched a new era of deep learning. Huang promptly directed the company to chase AI full-steam. When, in 2017, Google released the novel neural network architecture known as a transformer\u2014the T in ChatGPT\u2014and ignited the current AI gold rush, Nvidia was in a perfect position to start selling its AI-focused GPUs to hungry tech companies.Nvidia now accounts for more than 70 percent of sales in the AI chip market and is approaching a $2 trillion valuation. Its revenue for the last quarter of 2023 was $22 billion\u2014up 265 percent from the year prior. And its stock price has risen 231 percent in the last year. Huang is either uncannily good at what he does or ridiculously lucky\u2014or both!\u2014and everyone wants to know how he does it.But no one reigns forever. He\u2019s now in the crosshairs of the US-China tech war and at the mercy of regulators. Some of Huang\u2019s challengers in the AI chip world are household names\u2014Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft\u2014and have the deepest pockets in tech. In late December the semiconductor company AMD rolled out a large processor for AI computing that is meant to compete with Nvidia. Startups are taking aim too. In last year\u2019s third quarter alone, venture capitalists funneled more than $800 million into AI chips, according to the research firm Pitchbook.So Huang never rests. Not even during interviews, as I learned when, to my surprise, he started interviewing me, asking me where I was from and how I ended up living in the Bay Area.Jensen Huang: You and I are both Stanford grads.Lauren Goode: Yes. Well, I went to the journalism program, and you did not go to the journalism program.I wish I had.Why is that?Well, somebody who I really admire, as a leader and a person, is Shantanu Narayen, the CEO of Adobe. He said he always wanted to be a journalist because he loved telling stories.It seems like an important part of building a business, being able to tell its story effectively.Yes. Strategy setting is storytelling. Culture building is storytelling.You\u2019ve said many times you didn\u2019t sell the idea of Nvidia based on a pitch deck.That\u2019s right. It was really about telling the story.So I want to start with something that another tech executive told me. He noted that Nvidia is one year older than Amazon, but in many ways Nvidia has more of a \u201cday one\u201d approach than Amazon does. How do you maintain that outlook?That\u2019s really a good phrase, frankly. I wake up every morning like it\u2019s day one, and the reason is there\u2019s always something we\u2019re doing that has never been done before. There\u2019s also the vulnerable side of it. We very well could fail. Just now, I was having a meeting where we\u2019re doing something that is brand-new for our company, and we don\u2019t know how to do it right.What is the new thing?We\u2019re building a new type of data center. We call it an AI factory. The way data centers are built today, you have a lot of people sharing one cluster of computers and putting their files in this one large data center. An AI factory is much more like a power generator. It\u2019s quite unique. We\u2019ve been building it over the last several years, but now we have to turn this into a product.\u201cWe looked at the way Moore\u2019s law was formulated, and we said, \u2018Don\u2019t be limited by that. Moore\u2019s law is not a limiter to computing.\u2019\u201dWhat are you going to call it?We haven\u2019t given it a name yet. But it will be everywhere. Cloud service providers will build them, and we\u2019ll build them. Every biotech company will have it. Every retail company, every logistics company. Every car company in the future will have a factory that builds the cars\u2014the actual goods, the atoms\u2014and a factory that builds the AI for the cars, the electrons. In fact, you see Elon Musk doing that as we speak. He\u2019s well ahead of most in thinking about what industrial companies will look like in the future.You\u2019ve said before that you run a flat organization, with between 30 to 40 executives who report directly to you, because you want to be in the information flow. What has piqued your interest lately, that makes you think, \u201cI may need to bet Nvidia on this eventually?\u201dInformation doesn\u2019t have to flow from the top to the bottom of an organization, as it did back in the Neanderthal days when we didn\u2019t have email and texts and all those things. Information can flow a lot more quickly today. So a hierarchical tree, with information being interpreted from the top down to the bottom, is unnecessary. A flat network allows us to adapt a lot more quickly, which we need because our technology is moving so quickly.If you look at the way Nvidia\u2019s technology has moved, classically there was Moore\u2019s law doubling every couple of years. Well, in the course of the last 10 years, we\u2019ve advanced AI by about a million times. That\u2019s many, many times Moore\u2019s law. If you\u2019re living in an exponential world, you don\u2019t want information to be propagated from the top down one layer at a time.But I\u2019m asking you, what\u2019s your Roman Empire? Which is a meme. What\u2019s today\u2019s version of the transformer paper? What\u2019s happening right now that you feel is going to change everything?There are a couple things. One of them doesn\u2019t really have a name, but it\u2019s some of the work that we\u2019re doing in foundational robotics. If you could generate text, if you could generate images, can you also generate motion? The answer is probably yes. And then if you can generate motion, you can understand intent and generate a generalized version of articulation. Therefore, humanoid robotics should be right around the corner.And I think the work around state-space models, or SSMs, that allow you to learn extremely long patterns and sequences without growing quadratically in computation, probably is the next transformer.Photograph: Ryan YoungWhat does that enable? What\u2019s a real-life example?You could have a conversation with a computer that lasts a very long time, and yet the context is never forgotten. You could even change topics for a while and come back to an earlier one, and that context could be retained. You might be able to understand the sequence of an extremely long chain, like a human genome. And just by looking at the genetic code, you understand its meaning.How far away are we from that?In the recent past, from the time that we had AlexNet to superhuman AlexNet, that was only about five years. A robotic foundation model is probably around the corner\u2014I\u2019ll call it next year sometime. From that point, five years down the road, you\u2019re going to see some pretty amazing things.Which industry stands to benefit the most from a broadly trained model for robot behavior?Well, heavy industries represent the largest industries in the world. Moving electrons is not easy, but moving atoms is extremely hard. Transportation, logistics, moving heavy things from one place to another, discovering the next drug\u2014all of that requires an understanding of atoms, molecules, proteins. Those are the large, incredible industries that AI hasn\u2019t affected yet.You mentioned Moore\u2019s law. Is it irrelevant now?Moore\u2019s law is now much more of a systems problem than a chip problem. It\u2019s much more about the interconnectivity of multiple chips. About 10, 15 years ago, we started down the journey of disaggregating the computer so that you could take multiple chips and connect them together.Which is where your acquisition of the Israeli company Mellanox comes in, in 2019. Nvidia said at the time that modern computing has put enormous demands on data centers and that Mellanox\u2019s networking technology would make accelerated computing more efficient.Right, exactly. We bought Mellanox so that we could take an extension of our chip and make an entire data center into a super chip, which enabled the modern AI supercomputer. That was really about recognizing that Moore\u2019s law has come to an end and that if we want to continue to scale computing we have to do it at data center scale. We looked at the way Moore\u2019s law was formulated, and we said, \u201cDon\u2019t be limited by that. Moore\u2019s law is not a limiter to computing.\u201d We have to leave Moore\u2019s law behind so we can think about new ways of scaling.Mellanox is now recognized as a really smart acquisition for Nvidia. More recently, you attempted to acquire Arm, one of the most important chip IP companies in the world, until you were thwarted by regulators.That would\u2019ve been wonderful!I\u2019m not sure the US government agrees, but yes, let\u2019s put a pin in that. When you think about acquisitions now, what specific places are you looking at?The operating system of these large systems is insanely complex. How do you create an operating system in a computing stack that orchestrates the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, and now coming up to billions of little tiny processors that are in our GPUs? That\u2019s a very hard problem. If there are teams outside our company that do that, we can either partner with them or we could do more than that.So what I hear you saying is that it\u2019s crucial for Nvidia to have an operating system and to build it into more of a platform, really.We are a platform company.The more you become a platform, the more problems you face. People tend to put a lot more onus and responsibility on a platform for its output. How the self-driving car behaves, what the margin of error is on the health care device, whether there\u2019s bias in an AI system. How do you address that?We\u2019re not an application company, though. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to think about it. We will do as much as we have to, but as little as we can, to serve an industry. So in the case of health care, drug discovery is not our expertise, computing is. Building cars is not our expertise, but building computers for cars that are incredibly good at AI, that\u2019s our expertise. It\u2019s hard for a company to be good at all of those things, frankly, but we can be very good at the AI computing part of it.\u201cHow do you orchestrate the hundreds of millions, now coming up to billions, of little tiny processors that are in our GPUs? That\u2019s a very hard problem.\u201dLast year reports emerged that some of your customers were waiting several months for your AI GPUs. How are things looking now?Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to catch up on supply this year. Not this year, and probably not next year.What\u2019s the current wait time?I don\u2019t know what the current lead time is. But, you know, this year is also the beginning of a new generation for us.Do you mean Blackwell, your rumored new GPU?That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a new generation of GPUs coming out, and the performance of Blackwell is off the charts. It\u2019s going to be incredible.Does that equate to customers needing fewer GPUs?That\u2019s the goal. The goal is to reduce the cost of training models tremendously. Then people can scale up the models they want to train.Nvidia invests in a lot of AI startups. Last year it was reported that you invested in more than 30. Do those startups get bumped up in the waiting line for your hardware?They face the same supply crunch as everyone, because most of them use the public cloud, so they had to negotiate for themselves with the public cloud service providers. What they do get, though, is access to our AI technology, meaning they get access to our engineering capabilities and our special techniques for optimizing their AI models. We make it more efficient for them. If your throughput goes up by a factor of five, you\u2019re essentially getting five more GPUs. So that\u2019s what they get from us.Do you consider yourself a kingmaker in that regard?No. We invest in these companies because they\u2019re incredible at what they do. It\u2019s a privilege for us to be investing in them, not the other way around. These are some of the brightest minds in the world. They don\u2019t need us to support their credibility.What happens as machine learning turns more toward inference rather than training\u2014basically, if AI work becomes less computationally intensive? Does that reduce the demand for your GPUs?We love inference. In fact, I would say that Nvidia\u2019s business today is probably, if I were to guess, 40 percent inference, 60 percent training. The reason why that\u2019s a good thing is because that\u2019s when you realize AI is finally making it. If Nvidia\u2019s business is 90 percent training and 10 percent inference, you could argue that AI is still in research. That was the case seven or eight years ago. But today, whenever you type a prompt into a cloud and it generates something\u2014it could be a video, it could be an image, it could be 2D, it could be 3D, it could be text, it could be a graph\u2014it\u2019s most likely that there\u2019s an Nvidia GPU behind it.Photograph: Ryan YoungDo you see demand waning at any point for your GPUs for AI?I think we\u2019re at the beginning of the generative AI revolution. Today most of the computing that\u2019s done in the world is still retrieval-based. Retrieval means you touch something on your phone and it sends a signal out to the cloud to retrieve a piece of information. It might compose a response with a few different things and, using Java, present it to you on your phone, on your nice screen. In the future, computing is going to be more RAG-based. [Retrieval-augmented generation is a framework that allows a large language model to pull in data from outside its usual parameters.] The retrieval part of it will be less, and the personalized generation part will be much, much higher.That generation will be done by a GPU somewhere. So I think we\u2019re in the beginning of this retrieval-augmented, generative computing revolution, and generative AI is going to be integral to almost everything.The latest news is that you\u2019ve been working with the US government to come up with sanctions-compliant chips that you can ship to China. My understanding is that these are not the most advanced chips. How closely were you working with the administration to ensure that you could still do business in China?Well, to take a step back, it\u2019s an export control, not sanctions. The United States has determined that Nvidia\u2019s technology and this AI computing infrastructure are strategic to the nation and that export control would apply to it. We complied with the export control the first time\u2014In August 2022.Yes. And the United States added more provisions to the export control in 2023, which caused us to have to reengineer our products again. So we did that. We\u2019re in the process of coming up with a new set of products that are in compliance with today\u2019s export control rules. We work closely with the administration to make sure that what we come up with is consistent with what they had in mind.How big is your concern that these constraints will spur China to spin up competitive AI chips?China has things that are competitive.Right. This isn\u2019t data-center scale, but the Huawei Mate 60 smartphone that came out last year got some attention for its homegrown 7-nanometer chip.Really, really good company. They\u2019re limited by whatever semiconductor processing technology they have, but they\u2019ll still be able to build very large systems by aggregating many of those chips together.How concerned are you in general, though, that China will be able to match the US in generative AI?The regulation will limit China\u2019s ability to access state-of-the-art technology, which means the Western world, the countries not limited by the export control, will have access to much better technology, which is moving fairly fast. So I think the limitation puts a lot of cost burden on China. You can always, technically, aggregate more of the chipmaking systems to do the job. But it just increases the cost per unit on those. That\u2019s probably the easiest way to think about it.Does the fact that you\u2019re building compliant chips to keep selling in China affect your relationship with TSMC, Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor pride and joy?No. A regulation is specific. It\u2019s no different than a speed limit.You\u2019ve said quite a few times that of the 35,000 components that are in your supercomputer, eight are from TSMC. When I hear that, I think that must be a tiny fraction. Are you downplaying your reliance on TSMC?No, not at all. Not at all.So what point are you trying to make with that?I\u2019m simply emphasizing that in order to build an AI supercomputer, a whole lot of other components are involved. In fact, in our AI supercomputers, just about the entire semiconductor industry partners with us. We already partner very closely with Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel, AMD, Broadcom, Marvell, and so on and so forth. In our AI supercomputers, when we succeed, a whole bunch of companies succeed with us, and we\u2019re delighted by that.How often do you talk to Morris Chang or Mark Liu at TSMC?All the time. Continuously. Yeah. Continuously.What are your conversations like?These days we talk about advanced packaging, planning for capacity for the coming years, for advanced computing capacity. CoWoS [TSMC\u2019s proprietary method for cramming chip dies and memory modules into a single package] requires new factories, new manufacturing lines, new equipment. So their support is really, really quite important.I recently had a conversation with a generative-AI-focused CEO. I asked who Nvidia\u2019s competitors might be down the road, and this person suggested Google\u2019s TPU. Other people mention AMD. I imagine it\u2019s not such a binary to you, but who do you see as your biggest competitor? Who keeps you up at night?Lauren, they all do. The TPU team is extraordinary. The bottom line is, the TPU team is really great, the AWS Trainium team and the AWS Inferentia team are really extraordinary, really excellent. Microsoft has their internal ASIC development that\u2019s ongoing, called Maia. Every cloud service provider in China is building internal chips, and then there\u2019s a whole bunch of startups that are building great chips, as well as existing semiconductor companies. Everybody\u2019s building chips.That shouldn\u2019t keep me up at night\u2014because I should make sure that I\u2019m sufficiently exhausted from working that no one can keep me up at night. That\u2019s really the only thing I can control.But what wakes me up in the morning is surely that we have to keep building on our promise, which is, we\u2019re the only company in the world that everybody can partner with to build AI supercomputers at data-center scale and at the full stack.\u201cI\u2019ll try to do 40 push-ups a day. That doesn\u2019t take any longer than a couple of minutes. I\u2019m a lazy exerciser.\u201dI have some personal questions I wanted to ask you.[Huang to a public relations representative.] She\u2019s done her homework. Not to mention, I\u2019m just enjoying the conversation.I\u2019m glad. I am as well. I did want to\u2014By the way, whenever Morris, or people who I\u2019ve known a long time, ask me to be the moderator of interviews, the reason for that is because I\u2019m not going to sit there and interview them by asking them questions. I\u2019m just having a conversation with them. You have to be empathetic to the audience and what they might want to hear about.So I asked ChatGPT a question about you. I wanted to know if you had any tattoos, because I was going to propose that for our next meetup, that we get you a tattoo.If you get a tattoo, I\u2019ll get one.I already have one, but I\u2019ve been looking to expand.I have one too.Yes. This is what I learned from ChatGPT. It said Jensen Huang got a tattoo of the company logo when the stock price reached $100. Then it said, \u201cHowever, Huang has expressed that he\u2019s unlikely to get any more tattoos, noting the pain was more intense than he anticipated.\u201d It said you cried. Did you cry?A little bit. My recommendation is you should have a shot of whiskey before you do it. Or take Advil. I also think that women can take a lot more pain, because my daughter has a fairly large tattoo.So if you were down to get a tattoo, I was thinking a triangle might be nice, because who doesn\u2019t like triangles? They\u2019re perfect geometry.Or the silhouette of Nvidia\u2019s building! It\u2019s composed of triangles.That\u2019s a commitment. I was wondering, how often do you personally use ChatGPT or Bard, or the like?I\u2019ve been using Perplexity. I enjoy ChatGPT as well. I use both almost every day.For what?Research. For example, computer-aided drug discovery. Maybe you would like to know about the recent advancements in computer-aided drug discovery. And so you want to frame the overall topic so that you could have a framework, and from that framework, you could ask more and more specific questions. I really love that about these large language models.I heard you used to lift weights. Do you still do that?No. I\u2019ll try to do 40 push-ups a day. That doesn\u2019t take any longer than a couple of minutes. I\u2019m a lazy exerciser. I\u2019ll do squats while I\u2019m brushing my teeth.Recently you made a comment on the Acquired podcast that went viral. The hosts asked, if you were 30 years old today and were thinking about starting a company, what would you start? And you said you wouldn\u2019t start a company at all. Do you have any amendments to that?That question could be answered in two ways, and I answered it this way, which is: If I knew then all the things that I know now, I would be too intimidated to do it. I would be too afraid. I wouldn\u2019t have done it.You have to be somewhat delusional to start a business.That\u2019s the advantage of ignorance. You don\u2019t know how hard it\u2019s going to be, you don\u2019t know how much pain and suffering is involved. When I meet entrepreneurs these days, and they tell me how easy it\u2019s going to be, I\u2019m very supportive of them, and I don\u2019t actually try to burst their bubble. But I know it in the back of my mind, \u201cOh, boy, this is not going to turn out anything like they think.\u201dWhat would you say is the biggest sacrifice that you\u2019ve had to make in running Nvidia?The same sacrifices other entrepreneurs make. You work really, really hard. And for a long time, nobody thinks you\u2019re going to succeed. You\u2019re alone in believing that you\u2019re going to make it. The insecurities, the vulnerability, sometimes humiliation, it\u2019s all true. Nobody talks about it, but it\u2019s all true. CEOs and entrepreneurs are human like anybody else. And when they fail publicly, it\u2019s embarrassing.So when somebody said, \u201cJensen, with everything you have today, you wouldn\u2019t have started it?\u201d Like, \u201cNo, no, no, of course not.\u201d But if I had known then that Nvidia would become what it is today, would I have started the company, are you kidding me? I would\u2019ve sacrificed everything to do it.Updated 2/26/2024, 5:05pm ET: This story has been changed to reflect an update shared by Nvidia. Huang previously stated that Nvidia\u2019s AI computing business was comprised of 70 percent inference and 30 percent training. The correct figures are 40 percent inference and 60 percent training.Let us know what you think about this article.

27, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJensen (Jen-Hsun) Huang, Founder and CEO of technology company NVIDIA will deliver the keynote address at Caltech's 130th Annual Commencement Ceremony on June 14, 2024.Named the world's best CEO by Fortune, The Economist, and Brand Finance, Huang led NVIDIA to become a pioneer in accelerated computing and the fourth most valuable company in the world.\"As NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang has led a revolution in computation and artificial intelligence,\" said President Thomas F. Rosenbaum, the Sonja and William Davidow Presidential Chair and professor of physics. \"His personal story underlies these accomplishments and provides a touchpoint for our students as they embark on the next stages of their careers.\"Huang translated a childhood passion for computer gaming into a career of innovation, business development, and entrepreneurship, and, in doing so, is at the cutting edge of a technological revolution that is leading profound societal change.He was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1963 and lived in Thailand for part of his childhood. When he was nine, he and his brother moved to Tacoma, Washington, to live with their uncle. After Huang's parents were able to immigrate to the U.S., Huang and his brother reunited with them in Oregon. He attended Aloha High School, where he graduated at the age of 16 while also a nationally ranked table-tennis player. He completed his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and worked at LSI Logic, and Advanced Micro Devices during the early part of his career. In 1992, he received his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.Huang co-founded NVIDIA in 1993 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem to take advantage of the growing demand for 3D graphics and visualization technology that accompanied the rapidly expanding PC and gaming industries.The company initially focused on the development of microprocessors capable of providing high-quality 3D graphics. It is credited for inventing the graphics processing unit or GPU, which leveraged parallel computing to handle mathematical operations more efficiently than the more general central processing units, or CPUs. NVIDIA's RIVA 128 was the first GPU to integrate 3D, 2D, and video acceleration, leading to the company's widespread recognition.NVIDIA's success extended beyond gaming. Due to their enormous computing potential, the company's GPUs have since catalyzed the advancement of applications other than graphics, most notably in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). Coupled with the company's supercomputing software package, CUDA, NVIDIA technology enabled programmers to create AlexNet, a powerful neural network used for image recognition and classification that won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. NVIDIA's dedicated AI supercomputers also were responsible for training models used by ChatGPT.Huang's sights are now set on combining NVIDIA's computer graphics research with its generative AI research to create the \"Omniverse,\" a platform capable of simulating the real world to create \"digital twins\" that could be used for safely training robots and self-driving cars, among other applications.Huang is listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people and has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering. He is the recipient of the Robert N. Noyce Award from the Semiconductor Industry Association; the IEEE Founder's Medal; the Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award; and honorary doctorate degrees from Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University, and Oregon State University. The Denny's restaurant just outside of San Jose, California, where Huang invited Malachowsky and Priem to discuss what would become NVIDIA, honors the occasion with a plaque.Equally admired for his philanthropy, Huang and his wife, Lori\u2014also an alum of Oregon State University\u2014donated $50 million to help establish the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex at OSU. They donated $30 million to Stanford University to help support construction of the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center and $2 million for the Jen-Hsun Huang Hall at the Oneida Baptist Institute, Huang's childhood alma mater.For more information about Caltech's 130th Annual Commencement, visit commencement.caltech.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Subscribe\n    \n\nThe Caltech Weekly \n\n\nShare this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\ncampus events\nInstitute affairs\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n          Caltech Commencement\n          \n\n\n\n\n      See All News\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\n\n\n1200 East California Boulevard\nPasadena, California 91125\n\n\nContact Us\n|\nClaimed Copyright Infringement\n|\nPrivacy Notice\n|\nDigital Accessibility\n|\nSite Content Copyright \u00a9 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Log in.\n\n\n\nNvidia just proved why it really is the king of AI.The chipmaker reported bumper revenues of $22.1 billion for its fourth quarter, surpassing expectations.Nvidia has grown rapidly as its chips provide vital processing power to AI players.It sure seems like Nvidia is the king of AI right now.\n\nSince the start of the AI boom, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has gone on an outrageous growth journey as the rest of the tech world has come to its door begging for chips, known as GPUs, to power their AI ambitions.Here are some numbers for context. Nvidia began 2023 worth $350 billion, and ended it at $1.2 trillion. At the start of the week, it stood at $1.8 trillion. You can do the math.\n\nHere's another way of looking at it. Nvidia is now worth more than the entire Chinese stock market; more than all the energy stocks in the S&P 500 combined; and big enough to briefly become the third most valuable US company.But in case anyone needed another reminder of who rules the AI roost, Nvidia delivered it on Wednesday.The chip firm announced $22.1 billion of revenue in its fourth quarter, some 265% more than the same period the previous year, blowing analyst expectations out the water in the process. It also forecast revenue of $24 billion for the current quarter.\n\nNvidia stock surged as much as 14% in premarket trading Thursday.\"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.How Nvidia rose to the topThe Silicon Valley firm has positioned itself as an integral part of the AI ecosystem by supplying its GPUs to companies desperate for the hardware needed to train their generative AI tools.\n\nOpenAI uses the processors. So too do Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Last month, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg said his company will have stockpiled about 350,000 of Nvidia's top-line H100 GPUs by the end of the year.Demand for these chips has been so hot that it has led Huang to be anointed \"the godfather of AI\" and Nvidia more broadly as \"the most important stock on planet Earth\" by Goldman Sachs before the hotly anticipated earnings report dropped on Wednesday.There are a few reasons why Nvidia has become indispensable to tech firms trying to take advantage of the AI gold rush.\n\nFor one, it has a sophisticated software system called CUDA that effectively makes using its chips as simple as a plug-and-play model for companies \u2014\u00a0despite how complex or varied their AI models and workloads might be.The other reason Nvidia has seen such crazed demand is that there has been a shortage of its chips. Supply chain issues triggered during the pandemic have had a knock-on effect on production \u2014 issues that are yet to be fully resolved.As a result, companies have been scrambling to get their hands on Nvidia's chips as fast as they can to make sure they have enough computing power to power their AI applications, and get an edge over competitors.\n\nA never-ending bull run?There is reason to question just how long this crazed run for the stock can last.\n\n\n\n                                Related stories\n                              \n\n\n\nIn 2023, about a fifth of Nvidia's revenue was generated in China \u2014 a market that's become increasingly difficult to engage with due to tough US export controls that bar companies from shipping their most advanced products there.In Nvidia's case, that has meant bans on sales of its top-of-the-range H100 and A100 processors and triggered reports it will launch watered-down versions in China in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWhether Chinese firms will be scrambling over each other to secure these is another matter.Demand for downgraded chips risks being reduced amid ferocious competition between companies in China to get ahead on AI. That's especially so as domestic players seek to offer chips that can rival the very best Nvidia has to offer.A Reuters report in December, for instance, noted that Chinese tech giants Huawei and Tencent, as well as smaller chip firms such as Hygon Information Technology, were busy marketing their AI chips to local customers.\n\nCompetition is getting stronger in the West too. The CEO of AMD, Lisa Su, unveiled a new MI300X chip in December \u2014 a rival to Nvidia's H100, which she described as \"the most advanced AI accelerator in the industry.\"In addition, Nvidia management has indicated that its supply of chips will continue to improve. This has contrasted with recent quarters when Nvidia \"explicitly talked to demand exceeding product availability,\" Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said.\"Moving from shortages to adequate supply is always a dangerous shift as backlog necessarily gets worked down, meaning shipments outstrip true demand,\" Bryson said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, the likes of OpenAI's Sam Altman and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son are reported to be exploring hugely expensive chip ventures of their own to compete with Nvidia and resolve some of the ongoing supply constraints.These initiatives, however, will require huge effort and investment if they hope to stand a chance of taking on Nvidia.As Kathleen Brooks, research director for online broker XTB told BI: \"I have rarely heard a CEO be so bullish, so committed to this theme, and so convinced that this is the future.\"\n\nExpect Nvidia to remain a dominant AI force for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI\n\n\nOpenAI\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

These competitors have pushed each other to innovate, improve customer experiences, and expand their market presence.\nBut when those rivalries occur within a transformation shift, that is when things start to get interesting. Take for example the era-defining rivalry between Walmart and Amazon at the turn of the 21st century, characterized by the two company\u2019s efforts to dominate both online and offline retail at the advent of internet \u2014 a battle that is\u00a0still ongoing\u00a0today.\nIt is unlikely that the eCommerce and online shopping experiences, with their realm of conveniences enjoyed today by hundreds of millions of consumers around the world, would be possible were it not for the two American retail heavyweights duking it out over the course of two-plus decades.\nAnd as the artificial intelligence (AI) era progresses, a new battle is shaping up as would-be rivals continue to evolve their strategies to gain a competitive edge.\nOne of the more interesting pairings to watch in the fast-evolving AI landscape will be between Nvidia and OpenAI.\nJust as, in many ways, the battle between Amazon and Walmart shaped the whole of the internet, the dynamics between OpenAI and Nvidia will ultimately transform commercial and consumer AI.\nAfter all, AI, which requires accelerated computing to run, is seen by many as a natural progression, or a phase step up, of the internet\u2019s own foundational computing and information layers.\nRead more:\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s Blowout Earnings Cement AI, Accelerated Computing as Foundational Shifts\u00a0\u00a0\nWinner Takes All\nAnd there is one area where Nvidia is already a clear winner, and where OpenAI will be hard-pressed to catch cup in the near term: profitability and valuation.\nWhile OpenAI is valued at an admittedly\u00a0eye-popping $80 billion or more, Nvidia on Thursday (Feb. 22) joined the\u00a0$2 trillion club, adding the value of over four OpenAI\u2019s to its own market cap in just one trading session.\nNvidia is a leading technology company known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and hardware solutions, while OpenAI is primarily known for its work pioneering AI research and the development of commercially advanced language models and other foundational AI systems.\nOpenAI, like much of the AI landscape, relies on Nvidia GPUs to power its models and build its systems.\nAnd while the two companies are not direct rivals in the traditional sense of sharing \u2014 and fighting over \u2014 the same net-zero customer audience, they are increasingly coming into contact as AI marches forward.\nThat\u2019s because, while previously OpenAI represented the software pillar of the landscape and Nvidia represented the hardware pillar, the lines between the two are beginning to blue as resources become scarce and valuations skyrocket.\nRead more:\u00a0It\u2019s a \u201990s Browser War Redux as Musk and Meta Enter AI Race\nNvidia, for example, last week (Feb. 13) launched its own chatbot, directly competing with OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT product. What\u2019s more, the Nvidia chatbot is meant to be used on OpenAI-partner Microsoft\u2019s Windows PCs, allowing users to connect to open-source ChatGPT competitors like Mistral or Llama 2, per Nvidia\u2019s site page.\n\u201cWe have the speed, scale, and reach to help\u00a0every company\u00a0in every industry become an AI company,\u201d said\u00a0Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, on Wednesday (Feb. 21).\nAnd the chipmaker is putting its money where its mouth is,\u00a0investing in 35 AI startups\u00a0during 2023.\nAs PYMNTS reported, Nvidia\u2019s portfolio features investments in Hugging Face, a provider of data and tools for AI developers, and\u00a0CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure company specializing in high-performance computing applications that depend on Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, per the report. Recently, Nvidia made a substantial investment in Mistral, a Paris-based\u00a0AI startup valued at \u20ac2 billion (about $2.2 billion).\nBoth Hugging Face and Mistral compete with OpenAI.\nBut OpenAI is hardly sitting still. While Nvidia dominates the chip market with a global market share of greater than 80%, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly looking for up to $7 trillion in funding\u00a0for a project that would allow OpenAI to increase the marketplace\u2019s capacity for chipmaking.\u00a0\u00a0\nAt the same time, Nvidia\u2019s CEO has said that those plans, and their price tag, aren\u2019t exactly on the money.\nStill, no matter how the landscape shakes out, the competition is sure to be good for both company\u2019s end users as they push the frontier of innovation forward.\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, artificial intelligence, Editor's Picks, GenAI, generative AI, GPU, large language models, News, NVIDIA, OpenAI, PYMNTS News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n                FlexTecs Updates FlexTrap Tool to Capture Payments Discrepancies            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., the event delivers something for every technical level and interest area, including sessions on how to power content creation using OpenUSD and generative AI.\nAnd Omniverse OpenUSD month rolls on, spotlighting the open and extensible ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating and collaborating within 3D worlds. Follow NVIDIA Studio on Instagram, X and Facebook to learn more.\nStorytelling With Adobe AI and RTX\u00a0\nThe talented Toro is driven by stories.\nStories fuel Toro\u2019s creative process.\n\u201cUnderstanding how every person has a different upbringing and how the decisions they made took them to different places is absolutely inspiring,\u201d said Toro. \u201cWhen I discover a story worth telling, I just feel a necessity to tell it \u2014 and tell it right.\u201d\nIt\u2019s those stories that gave rise to Cinematic Portraits, a photo and video collection of people Toro\u2019s befriended, such as Korean painter Kim Nam Soon, age 81, who impressively learned how to paint at 65.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/studio-esteban-toro-kim-cinematic-1280w.mp4\n\u00a0\nToro\u2019s planning process is long and thorough \u2014 he can only retell stories by first having a conversation with each subject, making sure that they understand what the project is about and building a relationship with them so they feel comfortable enough to authentically share.\nHe captures video and photos of his subjects using Hasselblad and Sony camera gear. Then, he uses Adobe apps, accelerated by GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX technology, in post-production.\nToro deployed the Enhance Speech tool to boost the clarity and quality of voice recordings and adjusted enhancement levels with the Mix Amount setting \u2014 all powered by AI. The feature is 75% faster on a GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU compared with an RTX 3080 Ti.\n\u201cWithout AI, the footage, filmed in challenging, noisy conditions, would be unusable,\u201d he said.\nThe Text-Based Editing tool in Premiere Pro allowed Toro to use speech-to-text AI capabilities to automatically create captions, supported in 18 languages, for video footage \u2014 speeding the editing process.\nThe Text-Based Editing tool can create a transcription of a video sequence and add captions.\nToro also used the Filler Word Detection feature, which detects and deletes filler words and pauses, to achieve cleaner, more accurate transcripts. Filler words are language agnostic, so the feature works in all 18 languages supported in Text-Based Editing.\nAdobe expert Esteban Toro hard at work.\nAdobe offers a wide variety of time-saving features, such as the AI-powered Auto Reframe tool for automated editing in multiple size formats for social media with project templates. Toro\u2019s NVIDIA Studio laptop with the GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card accelerates all of these powerful tools.\nFinal file exports were achieved 4x faster than with a CPU alone thanks to the GPU-accelerated NVIDIA video encoder (NVENC). Toro quickly and easily added finishing touches in Photoshop Lightroom, using the RTX-accelerated, AI-powered Raw Details feature to refine the color detail of his high-resolution RAW images, and the Super Resolution feature to upscale images with higher quality than traditional methods.\n\u201cHaving a dedicated GPU for video projects when filming high-quality video is almost mandatory,\u201d said Toro. \u201cUsing NVIDIA GPUs allows me to render and process my projects faster, so the post-processing tools are serving my creative ideas, and I\u2019m not limited by what the computer can do, but exactly what I want to create.\u201d\nArtist and Adobe expert Esteban Toro.\nFollow Esteban Toro on Instagram.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AI Decoded | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | GeForce | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They\u2019ll form the largest display at NVIDIA\u2019s booth in the San Jose Convention Center, filling the MGX Pavilion.\nMGX Speeds Time to Market\nNVIDIA MGX is a blueprint for building accelerated servers with any combination of GPUs, CPUs and data processing units (DPUs) for a wide range of AI, high performance computing and NVIDIA Omniverse applications. It\u2019s a modular reference architecture for use across multiple product generations and workloads.\nGTC attendees can get an up-close look at MGX models tailored for enterprise, cloud and telco-edge uses, such as generative AI inference, recommenders and data analytics.\nThe pavilion will showcase accelerated systems packing single and dual GH200 Superchips in 1U and 2U chassis, linked via NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs and NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gb/s InfiniBand networks over LinkX cables and transceivers.\nThe systems support industry standards for 19- and 21-inch rack enclosures, and many provide E1.S bays for nonvolatile storage.\nGrace Hopper in the Spotlight\nHere\u2019s a sampler of MGX systems now available:\n\nASRock RACK\u2019s MECAI-GH-200, measuring 420 x 445 x 87mm, accelerates AI and 5G services in constrained spaces at the edge of telco networks.\nASUS\u2019s MGX server, the ESC NM2N-E1, slides into a rack that holds up to 32 GH200 processors and supports air- and water-cooled nodes.\nFoxconn provides a suite of MGX systems, including a 4U model that accommodates up to eight NVIDIA H100 NVL PCIe Tensor Core GPUs.\nGIGABYTE\u2019s XH23-VG0-MGX can accommodate plenty of storage in its four 2.5-inch Gen5 NVMe hot-swappable bays and two M.2 slots.\nInventec\u2019s systems can slot into 19- and 21-inch racks and use three different implementations of liquid cooling.\nLenovo supplies a range of 1U, 2U and 4U MGX servers, including models that support direct liquid cooling.\nPegatron\u2019s air-cooled AS201-1N0 server packs a BlueField-3 DPU for software-defined, hardware-accelerated networking.\nQCT can stack 16 of its QuantaGrid D74S-IU systems, each with two GH200 Superchips, into a single QCT QoolRack.\nSupermicro\u2019s ARS-111GL-NHR with nine hot-swappable fans is part of a portfolio of air- and liquid-cooled GH200 and NVIDIA Grace CPU systems.\nWiwynn\u2019s SV7200H, a 1U dual GH200 system, supports a BlueField-3 DPU and a liquid-cooling subsystem that can be remotely managed.\nWistron\u2019s MGX servers are 4U GPU systems for AI inference and mixed workloads, supporting up to eight accelerators in one system.\n\nThe new servers are in addition to three accelerated systems using MGX announced at COMPUTEX last May \u2014 Supermicro\u2019s ARS-221GL-NR using the Grace CPU and QCT\u2019s QuantaGrid S74G-2U and S74GM-2U powered by the GH200.\nGrace Hopper Packs Two in One\nSystem builders are adopting the hybrid processor because it packs a punch.\nGH200 Superchips combine a high-performance, power-efficient Grace CPU with a muscular NVIDIA H100 GPU. They share hundreds of gigabytes of memory over a fast NVIDIA NVLink-C2C interconnect.\nThe result is a processor and memory complex well-suited to take on today\u2019s most demanding jobs, such as running large language models. They have the memory and speed needed to link generative AI models to data sources that can improve their accuracy using retrieval-augmented generation, aka RAG.\nRecommenders Run 4x Faster\nIn addition, the GH200 Superchip delivers greater efficiency and up to 4x more performance than using the H100 GPU with traditional CPUs for tasks like making recommendations for online shopping or media streaming.\nIn its debut on the MLPerf industry benchmarks last November, GH200 systems ran all data center inference tests, extending the already leading performance of H100 GPUs.\nIn all these ways, GH200 systems are taking to new heights a computing revolution their namesake helped start on the first mainframe computers more than seven decades ago.\nExplore generative AI sessions and experiences at NVIDIA GTC, the global conference on AI and accelerated computing, running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\nAnd get the 30,000-foot view from NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang in his GTC keynote.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | GPU Computing | GTC 2024 | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA Quantum-2 | NVLink | Recommender Systems \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Khalid has covered tech, surveillance policy, consumer gadgets, and online communities for more than a decade.Nvidia surpassed Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday, only a day after it overtook Amazon. Bloomberg is reporting that the chip maker\u2019s stock is now worth $1.83 trillion, beating the Google owner\u2019s $1.82 market cap by a hair. This makes Nvidia the world\u2019s fourth most valuable company in the wake of the AI boom, after Microsoft ($3.04T), Apple ($2.84T) and Saudi Aramco. The company is currently making the H100 chip, which powers the majority of LLMs in use today, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and the majority of AI projects from Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon.The world\u2019s largest tech companies are involved in an AI chip arms race, with each of them hoping to create their own GPU chip to topple Nvidia\u2019s virtual monopoly. Ironically, as Bloomberg notes, Nvidia\u2019s top sales of AI chips come from those same companies. The Santa Clara-based firm is close to releasing a superior AI chip, the H200, which has more memory capacity and bandwidth than its predecessor. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Nvidia has invested $30 billion into a unit devoted to helping other companies make their own custom AI chips. Meaning, even if companies opt to build their own AI chips, Nvidia could get a piece of the action.Meanwhile, direct competitors like Intel and AMD are working on their own powerful chips that could rival the H200.See More: AIAmazonGoogleMicrosoftNewsNvidiaTechMore in this streamSee allNvidia announces Blackwell Ultra GB300 and Vera Rubin, its next AI \u2018superchips\u2019Sean Hollister6 minutes agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleIntel is reportedly testing its 18A process again.Umar ShakirMar 3CommentsComment Icon BubbleNvidia\u2019s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, will be unveiled next month.Sean HollisterFeb 26CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsPixel 9A leaks in review videos before it\u2019s even announcedInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

It\u2019s expected to generate trillions of dollars in economic dividends and productivity gains.\nCountries are investing in sovereign AI to develop and harness such benefits on their own. Sovereign AI refers to a nation\u2019s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks.\nWhy Sovereign AI Is Important\nThe global imperative for nations to invest in sovereign AI capabilities has grown since the rise of generative AI, which is reshaping markets, challenging governance models, inspiring new industries and transforming others \u2014 from gaming to biopharma. It\u2019s also rewriting the nature of work, as people in many fields start using AI-powered \u201ccopilots.\u201d\nSovereign AI encompasses both physical and data infrastructures. The latter includes sovereign foundation models, such as large language models, developed by local teams and trained on local datasets to promote inclusiveness with specific dialects, cultures and practices.\nFor example, speech AI models can help preserve, promote and revitalize indigenous languages. And LLMs aren\u2019t just for teaching AIs human languages, but for writing software code, protecting consumers from financial fraud, teaching robots physical skills and much more.\nIn addition, as artificial intelligence and accelerated computing become increasingly critical tools for combating climate change, boosting energy efficiency and protecting against cybersecurity threats, sovereign AI has a pivotal role to play in equipping every nation to bolster its sustainability efforts.\nFactoring In AI Factories\nComprising new, essential infrastructure for AI production are \u201cAI factories,\u201d where data comes in and intelligence comes out. These are next-generation data centers that host advanced, full-stack accelerated computing platforms for the most computationally intensive tasks.\nNations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunications providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public- and private-sector use.\n\u201cThe AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,\u201d NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent media Q&A.\nSovereign AI Efforts Underway\nNations around the world are already investing in sovereign AI.\nSince 2019, NVIDIA\u2019s AI Nations initiative has helped countries spanning every region of the globe to build sovereign AI capabilities, including ecosystem enablement and workforce development, creating the conditions for engineers, developers, scientists, entrepreneurs, creators and public sector officials to pursue their AI ambitions at home.\nFrance-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the iliad Group, is building Europe\u2019s most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer. The NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD comprises 127 DGX H100 systems, representing 1,016 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs interconnected by NVIDIA NVLink technology and the NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform. NVIDIA DGX systems also include NVIDIA AI Enterprise software for secure, supported and stable AI development and deployment.\nSwisscom Group, majority-owned by the Swiss government, recently announced its Italian subsidiary, Fastweb, will build Italy\u2019s first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer \u2014 also using NVIDIA AI Enterprise software \u2014 to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language.\nWith these NVIDIA technologies and its own cloud and cybersecurity infrastructures, Fastweb plans to launch an end-to-end system with which Italian companies, public-administration organizations and startups can develop generative AI applications for any industry.\nThe government of India has also announced sovereign AI initiatives promoting workforce development, sustainable computing and private-sector investment in domestic compute capacity. India-based Tata Group, for example, is building a large-scale AI infrastructure powered by the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, while Reliance Industries will develop a foundation LLM tailored for generative AI and trained on the diverse languages of the world\u2019s most populous nation.

Achieving this will require quantum computing to be embedded in other scientific domains, with applications in astronomy, life sciences, medicine, finance and more.\nPushing the Boundaries of Quantum Computing\r\nPawsey will deploy the system to run quantum workloads directly from traditional high performance computing systems, leveraging their processing power and developing hybrid algorithms that intelligently divide calculations into classical and quantum kernels, using the quantum device to improve computing efficiency. Quantum machine learning, chemistry simulations, image processing for radio astronomy, financial analysis, bioinformatics and specialized quantum simulators will be studied, starting with various quantum variational algorithms.\nPawsey is deploying eight NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip nodes based on NVIDIA MGX\u2122 modular architecture. GH200 Superchips eliminate the need for a traditional CPU-to-GPU PCIe connection by combining an Arm-based NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPU with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU in the same package, using NVIDIA NVLink\u2122-C2C chip interconnects.\nThis increases the bandwidth between GPU and CPU by 7x compared with the latest PCIe technology. It delivers up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data, giving quantum-classical researchers unprecedented power to solve the world\u2019s most complex problems.\nPawsey is committed to making the NVIDIA Grace Hopper platform available to the Australian quantum community, as well as its international partners.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

In addition, the survey showed that, among respondents, AI is improving both revenues and cost savings.\nThe generative AI insight is the main highlight in the second edition of NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cState of AI in Telecommunications\u201d survey, which included questions covering a range of AI topics, including infrastructure spending, top use cases, biggest challenges and deployment models.\nSurvey respondents included C-suite leaders, managers, developers and IT architects from mobile telecoms, fixed and cable companies. The survey was conducted over eight weeks between October and December.\n\nRamping Up on Generative AI\nThe survey results show how generative AI went from relative obscurity in 2022 to a key solution within a year. Forty-three percent of respondents reported they were investing in it, showing clear evidence that the telecom industry is enthusiastically embracing the generative AI wave to address a wide variety of business goals.\nMore broadly, there was a marked increase in interest in adopting AI and growing expectations of success from the technology, especially among industry executives. In the survey, 53% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that adopting AI will be a source of competitive advantage, compared to 39% who reported the same in 2022. For management respondents, the figure was 56%.\nThe primary reason for this sustained engagement is because many industry stakeholders expect AI to contribute to their company\u2019s success. Overall, 56% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that \u201cAI is important to my company\u2019s future success,\u201d with the figure rising to 61% among decision-making management respondents. The overall figure is a 14-point boost over the 42% result from the 2022 survey.\nCustomer Experience Remains Key Driver of AI Investment\u00a0\nTelcos are adopting AI and generative AI to address a wide variety of business needs. Overall, 31% of respondents said they invested in at least six AI use cases in 2023, while 40% are planning to scale to six or more use cases in 2024.\nBut enhancing customer experiences remains the biggest AI opportunity for the telecom industry, with 48% of survey respondents selecting it as their main goal for using the technology. Likewise, some 35% of respondents identified customer experiences as their key AI success story.\nFor generative AI, 57% are using it to improve customer service and support, 57% to improve employee productivity, 48% for network operations and management, 40% for network planning and design, and 32% for marketing content generation.\nEarly Phase of AI Investment Cycle\nThe focus on customer experience is influencing investments. Investing in customer-experience optimization remains the most popular AI use case for 2023 (49% of respondents) and for generative AI investments (57% of respondents).\nTelcos are also investing in other AI use cases: security (42%), network predictive maintenance (37%), network planning and operations (34%) and field operations (34%) are notable examples. However, using AI for fraud detection in transactions and payments had the biggest jump in popularity between 2022 and 2023, rising 14 points to 28% of respondents.\nOverall, investments in AI are still in an early phase of the investment cycle, although growing strongly. In the survey, 43% of respondents reported an investment of over $1 million in AI in their previous year, 52% reported the same for the current year, and 66% reported their budget for AI infrastructure will increase in the next year.\nFor those who are already investing in AI, 67% reported that AI adoption has helped them increase revenues, with 19% of respondents noting that this revenue growth is more than 10% in specific business areas. Likewise, 63% reported that AI adoption has helped them reduce costs in specific business areas, with 14% noting that this cost reduction is more than 10%.\nInnovation With Partners\nWhile telcos are increasing their investments to improve their internal AI capabilities, partnerships remain critical for the adoption of AI solutions in the industry. This is applicable both for AI models and AI hardware infrastructure.\nIn the survey, 44% of respondents reported that co-development with partners is their company\u2019s preferred approach to building AI solutions. Some 28% of respondents prefer to use open-source tools, while 25% take an AI-as-a-service approach. For generative AI, 29% of respondents built or customized models with a partner, an understandable conservative approach for the telecom industry with its stringent data protection rules.\nFor infrastructure, increasingly, many telcos are opting for cloud hosting, although the hybrid model still remains dominant. In the survey, 31% of respondents reported that they run most of their AI workloads in the cloud (44% for hybrid), compared to 21% of respondents in the previous survey (56% for hybrid). This is helping to fuel the growing need for more localized cloud infrastructure.\nDownload the \u201cState of AI in Telecommunications: 2024 Trends\u201d report for in-depth results and insights.\nExplore how AI is transforming telecommunications at NVIDIA GTC, featuring industry leaders including Amdocs, Indosat, KT, Samsung Research, ServiceNow, Singtel, SoftBank, Telconet and Verizon.\nLearn more about NVIDIA solutions for telecommunications across customer experience, network operations, sovereign AI factories and more.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We\u2019re also deep diving on new GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU features, technologies and resources, and how they dramatically accelerate content creation.\nThe February NVIDIA Studio Driver, designed specifically to optimize creative apps, is now available for download. Developed in collaboration with app developers, Studio Drivers undergo extensive testing to ensure seamless compatibility with creative apps while enhancing features, automating processes and speeding workflows.\nCreators can download the latest driver on the public beta of the new NVIDIA app, the essential companion for creators and gamers with NVIDIA GPUs in their PCs and laptops. The NVIDIA app beta is a first step to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience and RTX Experience apps.\nThe NVIDIA App offers easy access to the latest Studio Drivers, a suite of AI-powered Studio apps, games and more.\nThe NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping PCs updated with the latest NVIDIA drivers, enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA apps like NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse, unifies the GPU control center, and introduces a redesigned in-app overlay for convenient access to powerful recording tools. Download the NVIDIA app beta today.\nAdobe Premiere Pro\u2019s AI-powered Enhance Speech tool is now available in general release. Accelerated by NVIDIA RTX, the new feature removes unwanted noise and improves the quality of dialogue clips so they sound professionally recorded.

Download Chat with RTX today.\n\nAnd this week In the NVIDIA Studio, filmmaker James Matthews shares his short film, Dive, which was created with an Adobe Premiere Pro-powered workflow supercharged by his ASUS ZenBook Pro NVIDIA Studio laptop with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.\nGoing With the Flow\nMatthews\u2019 goal with Dive was to create a visual and auditory representation of what it feels like to get swallowed up in the creative editing process.\nTalk about a dream content creation location.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m really deep into an edit, I sometimes feel like I\u2019m fully immersed into the film and the editing process itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a flow state, where time stands still and you are one with your own creativity.\u201d\nTo capture and visualize that feeling, Matthews used the power of his ASUS ZenBook Pro NVIDIA Studio laptop equipped with a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card.\nHe started by brainstorming \u2014 listening to music and sketching conceptual images with pencil and paper. Then, Matthews added a song to his Adobe Premiere Pro timeline and created a shot list, complete with cuts and descriptions of focal range, speed, camera movement, lighting and other details.\nNext, he planned location and shooting times, paying special attention to lighting conditions.\n\u201cI always have my Premiere Pro timeline up so I can really see and feel what I need to create from the images I originally drew while building the concept in my head,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThis helps get the pacing of each shot right, by watching it back and possibly adding it into the timeline for a test.\u201d\nThen, Matthews started editing the footage in Premiere Pro, aided by his Studio laptop. His dedicated GPU-based NVIDIA video encoder (NVENC) enabled buttery-smooth playback and scrubbing of his high-resolution and multi-stream footage, saving countless hours.\n\nMatthews\u2019 RTX GPU accelerated a variety of AI-powered Adobe video editing tools, such as Enhance Speech, Scene Edit Detection and Auto Color, which applies color corrections with just a few clicks.\n\nFinally, Matthews added sound design before exporting the final files twice as fast thanks to NVENC\u2019s dual AV1 encoders.\n\u201cThe entire edit used GPU acceleration,\u201d he shared. \u201cEffects in Premiere Pro, along with the NVENC video encoders on the GPU, unlocked a seamless workflow and essentially allowed me to get into my flow state faster.\u201d\nFilmmaker James Matthews.\nWatch Matthews\u2019 content on YouTube.\nFollow NVIDIA Studio on Facebook, Instagram and X .

Chat With RTX Brings Custom Chatbot to NVIDIA RTX AI PCs\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTech demo gives anyone with an RTX GPU the power of a personalized GPT chatbot.\t\t\t\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024 by Jesse Clayton \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Chatbots are used by millions of people around the world every day, powered by NVIDIA GPU-based cloud servers. Now, these groundbreaking tools are coming to Windows PCs powered by NVIDIA RTX for local, fast, custom generative AI.\nChat with RTX, now free to download, is a tech demo that lets users personalize a chatbot with their own content, accelerated by a local NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU or higher with at least 8GB of video random access memory, or VRAM.\nAsk Me Anything\nChat with RTX uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software and NVIDIA RTX acceleration to bring generative AI capabilities to local, GeForce-powered Windows PCs. Users can quickly, easily connect local files on a PC as a dataset to an open-source large language model like Mistral or Llama 2, enabling queries for quick, contextually relevant answers.\n\nRather than searching through notes or saved content, users can simply type queries. For example, one could ask, \u201cWhat was the restaurant my partner recommended while in Las Vegas?\u201d and Chat with RTX will scan local files the user points it to and provide the answer with context.\nThe tool supports various file formats, including .txt, .pdf, .doc/.docx and .xml. Point the application at the folder containing these files, and the tool will load them into its library in just seconds.\nUsers can also include information from YouTube videos and playlists. Adding a video URL to Chat with RTX allows users to integrate this knowledge into their chatbot for contextual queries. For example, ask for travel recommendations based on content from favorite influencer videos, or get quick tutorials and how-tos based on top educational resources.\nChat with RTX can integrate knowledge from YouTube videos into queries.\nSince Chat with RTX runs locally on Windows RTX PCs and workstations, the provided results are fast \u2014 and the user\u2019s data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.\nIn addition to a GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU or higher with a minimum 8GB of VRAM, Chat with RTX requires Windows 10 or 11, and the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers.\nEditor\u2019s note: We have identified an issue in Chat with RTX that causes installation to fail when the user selects a different installation directory. This will be fixed in a future release. For the time being, users should use the default installation directory (\u201cC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\NVIDIA\\ChatWithRTX\u201d).\nDevelop LLM-Based Applications With RTX\nChat with RTX shows the potential of accelerating LLMs with RTX GPUs. The app is built from the TensorRT-LLM RAG developer reference project, available on GitHub. Developers can use the reference project to develop and deploy their own RAG-based applications for RTX, accelerated by TensorRT-LLM.

But CEO Jensen Huang isn\u2019t just banking on selling AI chips to companies. He\u2019s also looking at selling to entire countries as part of a concept known as sovereign AI.  \u201cThe language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different,\u201d Huang said during Nvidia\u2019s earnings call. \u201cAnd they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it to create their own digital intelligence, and provision it to harness that raw material themselves.\u201d Sovereign AI boils down to a single country or region setting up its own AI capabilities, allowing its AI to meet its own needs. \u201cIn regions outside of the US and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver,\u201d said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress.   Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on Oct. 18, 2023. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images \u201cCountries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems,\u201d she added. According to Huang, Japan, Canada, France, and a number of other regions are already setting up their own sovereign AI systems. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.24 -2.29 (-1.92%)  As of 2:56:08 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    Of course, sovereign AI isn\u2019t the only thing driving Nvidia\u2019s sales. In fact, the company said that more than half of its Data Center sales, which accounted for $18.4 billion of the firm\u2019s $22.1 billion in overall revenue, came from large cloud providers. A number of those large cloud providers, however, are working on their own specialized AI chips that will prove more efficient in terms of performance and power compared to Nvidia\u2019s chips. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft already have or are developing their own chips as a means of weaning off of their dependence on Nvidia.   Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance But Nvidia isn\u2019t taking the challenge lying down. According to Reuters, the company has reportedly reached out to the three cloud providers with the hopes of producing those custom chips for them. It\u2019s not as though Nvidia is hurting at the moment, though. The chip giant raked in nearly as much revenue in Q4 as it did in all of last year: $27 billion. And it\u2019s expected to bring in even more next quarter, with guidance calling for revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Nvidia)\n\n\n\n\nIn a new note to its clients, analyst firm UBS says that the lead time (wait time) for Nvidia's\u00a0hugely popular H100 80GB\u00a0GPU\u00a0for AI applications has shortened from\u00a08-11 months\u00a0to just 3-4 months\u00a0(via\u00a0SeekingAlpha). According to the firm, this shift suggests a potential peak in\u00a0near-term\u00a0growth but\u00a0could signal trouble for Nvidia's future growth prospects.\u00a0However, UBS still upgraded its outlook on Nvidia,\u00a0increasing its earnings forecasts and target price to $850.\u00a0The reduction in lead times is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it indicates that Nvidia's production partner TSMC (or its chip-packaging subcontractors) is expanding its CoWoS packaging production capacity (which limited the supply of H100 and other advanced processors used for AI applications), which means better supply and quicker fulfillment of orders. This efficiency could lead to short-term revenue and earnings boosts as the company can ship more products within a shorter timeframe. On the other hand, as lead times approach zero, Nvidia will transition from shipping against both backlogs and new orders to solely new orders, likely resulting in a decline in revenue.TSMC said it would\u00a0expand CoWoS capacity by the end of 2023 and double capacity from mid-2023 levels by the end of 2024. Perhaps the expansion of CoWoS capacity at TSMC or one of its OSAT partners is proceeding faster than expected, leading to the reduction in H100 lead times.\u00a0On the other hand, now that Nvidia\u00a0cannot ship fully-enabled H100 to China due to U.S. restrictions, reportedly leading to lower demand in China, it might simply have plenty of 'spare' H100 silicon to ship elsewhere. While China accounts for a significant portion of Nvidia's revenue, it isn't clear if its reduced shipments could cause H100 lead times to shrink from\u00a08-11 months to just 3-4 months.The market currently anticipates continued growth for Nvidia, with no expected quarter-on-quarter drops in revenue up to January 2026. However, the rapid decrease in lead times suggests that this growth might\u00a0cool off\u00a0much sooner, potentially within the next\u00a0two or three\u00a0quarters.\u00a0Analysts note this scenario is not reflected in the stock's current valuation, which assumes uninterrupted growth.\u00a0Despite the potential for a slowdown in Nvidia's growth, it's important to note that the overall AI capacity will continue to expand. Nvidia's shipments will contribute to the growing install base of GPUs, and other competitors will add to this growth. Therefore, while Nvidia's sequential growth may face challenges, the broader AI industry will continue to advance.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (2)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

This is similar to Huawei hoarding 7nm chips from TSMC just before the sanction. That\u2019s why it\u2019s expected that sales won\u2019t sustain.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavidLejdar\n\n\nI know, that there is value in improved technology for data processing. In particular improved RAM helps a lot with that, as a data process doesn't need a back and forth of terabytes of data with usually slower storage device. \n\nBut with all the hype about autonomous AI, I am a bit worried, that Nvidia in particular may have an AI, which goes rogue and overtakes or makes all of their networks unusable (such as by basically frying them). Something which wouldn't be good for the share price, I suppose. \n\nAnd I am just an average worker, who, unlike institutional investors, doesn't have the time to constantly keep checking for such news, to then quickly sell. That's why I am somewhat reluctant to purchase Nvidia shares, even if it may sure still have some potential nice return within a relatively short time frame.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All 2 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Flower\u2019s beastly 2800W power supply lands at $899 \u2014 enough juice to power a couple of RTX 5090 GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei's Microsoft Windows license for PCs expires this month, company launching PCs with Harmony OS: Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX 50-series GPU scalping extends to system integrators \u2014 over $3,000 for a RTX 5090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO gets a $1 million salary plus $68 million in bonuses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNES consoles appear to run faster with age \u2014 APU frequency increased by up to 182 Hz after 35 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech giants call Trump tariffs 'big headache' \u2014 Foxconn CEO teases increased production in US\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe week in chip news: Intel gets a new CEO, China chip smuggling, AMD dominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Pico powers $75 PicoCalc portable programming handheld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel's new CEO warns employees about 'tough decisions', but Wall Street cheers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMSI skips RDNA 4 and will not manufacture AMD Radeon 9000-series GPUs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Nvidia\u2019s $61 billion in sales and $30 billion in net income during its latest fiscal year are the lowest of any of those six trillion-dollar companies. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, who was one of the few analysts to cut its price target for Nvidia following the latter\u2019s Wednesday earnings report, noted that it\u2019s still the \u201cearly innings\u201d of AI and that Nvidia\u2019s sales could be entering a \u201csteady state\u201d after more than doubling last year.\n\nKey Background\nThe consensus on Wall Street buys into the narrative of further growth for Nvidia, projecting both sales and profits to roughly double this year. Nvidia, which designs the semiconductor chip technology needed for generative AI, counts the likes of fellow tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet as its top customers. Nvidia has actually transformed its business model in recent years. Its gaming unit moved from 53% of total revenues in its 2019 fiscal year to just 17% last year, coinciding with its AI-centered datacenter division\u2019s move from a 25% revenue share to 78%. Nvidia\u2019s CEO and cofounder Jensen Huang has grown incredibly wealthy as Nvidia\u2019s valuation soared, with his net worth exploding from below $4 billion to about $70 billion over the last four years, according to Forbes\u2019 estimates.\n\nFurther ReadingForbesNvidia's Record Rally Makes CEO Jensen Huang $9 Billion RicherBy Derek Saul\nForbesNvidia's $200 Billion Surge Boosts S&P 500 To Record HighBy Derek Saul\n\nForbesNvidia Earnings Mark Another Historic Quarter For AI TitanBy Derek Saul\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades"

That\u2019s about how much Nvidia stock is up since the end of last year, more than 70 percentage points better than the S&P 500\u2019s next best performer during the timeframe, adding $1.3 trillion to Nvidia\u2019s valuation.\n\nSurprising Fact\nAnalysts project Nvidia to report 270% profit growth ($3.34 earnings per share to $12.39) and 120% year-over-year sales growth ($27 billion to $59 billion) for its fourth fiscal quarter. For comparison, Microsoft, viewed as the other major winner of the AI boom, is expected to report 10% and 20% top and bottom line expansion this fiscal year, as Nvidia scales at a pace rarely seen by a company of its size.\nKey Background\nNvidia, which is the leading architect of the semiconductor chip technology powering generative AI, captured the hearts of Wall Street beginning last year as corporate interest in AI intensified, helping drag U.S. stocks out of their brutal 2022 and to new highs alongside other big technology stocks. Nvidia is expected to report full-year sales of $59 billion and net profits of $28 billion for its fiscal year ending last month, noticeably outperforming respective estimates a year ago of $30 billion and $8 billion, according to average analyst estimates compiled by FactSet.\n\nFurther ReadingForbes\u200b\u200bHow Nvidia's Investment Arm Is Supercharging A New Class Of AI StartupsBy Richard Nieva\n\nForbesNvidia Is Now More Valuable Than Amazon And GoogleBy Derek Saul\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades"
