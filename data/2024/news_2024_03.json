The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.7% after logging another record close on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.2%, with losses pared by a pop in Apple (AAPL) shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 1.2% after a sharp gain the previous day. Shares of Nvidia fell more than 5% after a record-breaking hot streak.  Friday's non-farm payrolls report showed the US economy added 275,000 jobs in February, once again zooming past Wall Street expectations. However, the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9%, its first increase in four months. Futures on the three major averages were trading in red figures ahead of the jobs data. The report bolstered investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates following its June meeting, but the momentum fizzled by the end of the trading day. Showing how the wind is blowing elsewhere, policymakers from the European Central Bank lined up to support a rate cut before their summer break as inflation falls faster than expected. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan officials are said to be warming to the idea of finally lifting rates out of the negative zone. On the corporate front, Costco (COST) shares fell 7% after its quarterly sales miss overshadowed an earnings beat. Broadcom's (AVGO) revenue beat and forecast for $10 billion in sales of AI-linked chips failed to impress investors, sending the stock over 6% lower. In commodities, gold futures (GC=F) continued to rally, as spot gold eyed its biggest weekly jump in five months amid optimism for a mid-year Fed rate cut.

Friday's trading session offered an answer, at least temporarily. Wall Street ended the day down as investors took profits and paused what had been a staggering rally for Big Tech names, including the AI chipmaker.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed 0.2%, with losses tempered by Apple's (AAPL) gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 1.2% after a sharp increase the previous day. Shares of Nvidia fell more than 5%, pausing a hot streak.  Sat, March 9, 2024 at 4:45 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  SEC\u2019s Gensler says crypto 'rife with abuses and fraud' as bitcoin surges to new all-time high Just as the most influential and popular cryptocurrency set an all-time record \u2014 briefly surpassing $70,000 \u2014 SEC Chair Gary Gensler offered new warnings about cryptocurrencies, saying in an interview with Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger that \"the whole field is rife with abuses and fraud.\"Investors, he added, should be aware that bitcoin is a \"highly speculative, volatile underlying asset.\"CCC - CoinMarketCap \u2022 USD  Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD)   ADD_TO_FOLLOWING    VIEW_QUOTE_DETAILS    81,881.13 -2,668.16 (-3.16%)  MARKET_TIME_NOTICE_OPEN     OPEN_ADVANCED_CHART   His remarks come amid a crypto resurgence. Bitcoin this week reached levels that investors have not seen since the 2021 boom, climbing out from the doldrums of the 2022 crash.The latest rally was sparked by demand from a series of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that started trading in January after receiving approvals from the SEC.Gensler voted in favor of those ETFs. On Friday he said of that decision \"I thought it was the most straightforward path forward.\"See the full interview and story here.  Sat, March 9, 2024 at 4:00 AM GMT+8 Jared Blikre  Apple pops from 'oversold,' but history suggests the selling may not be over Mean-reversion is the trade today, though some will call it \"profit-taking.\" Regardless, some of year's biggest winners like Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell (MRVL) are down decent amounts as beaten-down stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Etsy (ETSY) are seeing a nice pop.Apple stock has been particularly weak lately, suffering the biggest drop in Relative Strength Index (RSI) since December 2018. Thursday's close at 21.9 is solidly below the 30 level, which is commonly understood to indicate \"oversold.\"When a stock becomes deeply oversold like this, it can potentially lead to an interim bottom. (It can work the other way too at highs when a stock is overbought.) But this is not always the case.  What's Next for Apple Stock After a Quick Crash to Oversold?  The above study reveals how Apple stock fared following a close in RSI above 25 after closing below it the prior day.This \"oversold pop\" setup in Apple has caught a few price bottoms precisely \u2014 like June 28, 2013, and Feb. 6, 2018 \u2014 leading to both short- and long-term gains.But, more often than not in the dozen instances this signal has fired since the year 2000, Apple stock bleeds lower in the subsequent days and weeks. The average and median returns are negative in time periods up to one month following the signal.Notably, the results get much better as more time passes, with average gains of over 25% one year later and 75% positive results.   Sat, March 9, 2024 at 3:45 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Why Elon Musk is both right and wrong about AI Less than a week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk sued OpenAI, alleging the influential AI startup abandoned its original mission of working for the public good, the company struck back.OpenAI published a blog post that revealed a Musk-backed plan to turn the organization into a for-profit entity as early as 2017. The maker of ChatGPT also contends Musk vied for total control over the transformed company.Musk argued that OpenAI breached its founding ethos of sharing its tech breakthroughs with the public by becoming a closed-source ally with Microsoft. In shared emails, OpenAI's leaders suggested that, as their technology advances, scientific details should be kept from full public view to guard against bad actors.In the unflattering portrait OpenAI presents, Musk comes off as a bitter ex and a hypocrite. And though the re-heated memes Musk has been sharing and responding to on X about OpenAI needing to change its name are embarrassing cringe content, they also offer a straightforward critique of the company.Because the same evidence OpenAI marshals against Musk undermines the startup's own narrative about democratizing the power of advanced AI tools.That's part of what makes OpenAI's straight-faced mission statement about benefiting humanity and \"helping create broadly distributed benefits\" hard to take seriously.A decade ago, tech's big social aims held sway. But in 2024, you don't need a trove of emails to learn that story isn't real.  Sat, March 9, 2024 at 3:01 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Jobs report bolsters case for a rate cut later this year The February jobs report calmed concerns that inflation concerns could keep the Federal Reserve from cutting rates this year.The newly released jobs data released Friday showed the US economy added far fewer jobs in the previous two months than previously believed, and signs of slowing wage growth are beginning to emerge, reports Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer.An uptick in unemployment to 3.9%, in line with its highest level seen in the last two years, bolstered the narrative that the labor market remains resilient but not strong enough to rule out a coming rate cut.\"After today\u2019s report, we remain comfortable with our longstanding call for a first rate cut from the Fed in June. The rise in unemployment and easing in wage inflation should make the FOMC a little more confident that the labor market is moving back into balance,\" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday.  Sat, March 9, 2024 at 2:22 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks trending in afternoon trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:Bitcoin (BTC-USD): The world's largest cryptocurrency reached an all-time high Friday, surpassing $70,000 for the first time, but swiftly climbed down to around $68,000 as some investors locked in their profits. The recent burst of excitement around the digital currency lifted the price to levels not seen since late 2021.Nvidia (NVDA): The stock at the center of Wall Street's AI excitement pulled back nearly 5% during afternoon trading, as the company's staggering rise takes a breather. In recent months the investor frenzy around the stock has intensified as tech companies who rely on Nividia's technology double down on investment in the rapidly developing field.Costco (COST): Shares of the warehouse retailer fell by more than 7% Friday after the company reported mixed second quarter results.Rivian (RIVN): The all-electric car company rose 2% during afternoon trading after the company unveiled two new lower-priced SUVs. The first of the two, a midsize SUV called the R2, will start at around $45,000, and Rivian plans to ship it in the first half of 2026. The move is designed to attract a broader consumer base, akin to Tesla's Model 3.   Sat, March 9, 2024 at 1:36 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks wobble in afternoon trading  After a powerful surge investors are taking a breather, sending stocks mostly lower during afternoon trading on Friday and putting a pause on the tech-led rally.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) trended near the flatline after logging another record close on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) increased by close to 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost 0.3% after a sharp gain the previous day.  Sat, March 9, 2024 at 12:45 AM GMT+8 Dani Romero  RealPage expects 'muted' rent growth in 2024 Renters across the country can breathe easier this year as an influx of apartment supply pressures rent growth.Asking rents for professionally managed apartments inched up just 0.2% in February from the previous year, according to data from RealPage. That's notably lower than the historical average of 0.6% dating back to 2010.\u201cMuted rent growth is expected to continue throughout 2024 as supply continues to put downward pressure on rents,\u201d RealPage said in a report.Austin was the biggest laggard for rent growth, with a decline of 6.7% annually in February. Meanwhile, Virginia Beach led rent increases, with an uptick of 3.3%.While strategists have been expecting a slowdown in rents, one inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, has shown rents to be sticky. Analysts say this is because there is a lag in the data. February CPI will be released on Tuesday.Overall, apartment occupancy remained steady at 94.1% in February, according to RealPage, marking the third consecutive month at this rate.RealPage noted that record-high construction activity in the apartment sector poses a challenge to occupancy levels this year, with nearly 962,000 units under construction nationally at the end of 2023 and 672,000 units expected to be completed this year.  Sat, March 9, 2024 at 12:22 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Bitcoin briefly hits $70,000 Bitcoin (BTC-USD) reached an all-time high Friday, surpassing $70,000 for the first time, but swiftly climbed down as some investors locked in their profits.The recent burst of excitement around the world's largest cryptocurrency lifted the price to levels not seen since late 2021. Earlier this week, investors pushed the price to to nearly $69,000, matching the previous high set during the acute phase of the pandemic. But bitcoin tumbled below the $60,000 level again in a matter of hours, highlighting the volatility of the market.The recent trading frenzy reinforced a remarkable comeback for bitcoin following a 2022 crash that created huge losses for investors and triggered the downfall of several big industry players, including cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports.   Fri, March 8, 2024 at 11:29 PM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks trending in morning trading Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance\u2019s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:Rivian (RIVN): The all-electric car company rose 6% during morning trading after the company unveiled two new lower-priced SUVs. The first of the two, a midsize SUV called the R2, will start at around $45,000, and Rivian plans to ship it in the first half of 2026. The move is designed to attract a broader consumer base, akin to Tesla's Model 3.Costco (COST): Shares of the warehouse retailer fell sharply Friday after the company reported mixed second quarter results.Gap (GPS): The clothing company gained 3% Friday after reporting fourth quarter earnings that exceeded expectations for both the top and bottom lines. The latest quarterly results arrive about six months into the tenure of CEO Richard Dickson, whose mandate was to turn the company around.Broadcom (AVGO): Shares of the semiconductor manufacturer slipped 3% after reporting first quarter results that topped analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. However, the report was not the blowout many investors had hoped for, sending shares slightly lower.  Fri, March 8, 2024 at 10:36 PM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Stocks head for winning week after jobs report  Wall Street rang in the trading day on a positive note, as stocks climbed higher after the February jobs report showed an increase in the unemployment rate. A slightly weaker jobs market bolsters the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this summer, lifting investor optimism.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.3%.  Fri, March 8, 2024 at 8:30 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  Costco being Costco Costco (COST) being Costco has historically worked very well for investors.The company sells giant $1.50 hot dogs at its foodcourt (they taste great, as you can see below in my 2022 photo with retired CEO Craig Jelinek). In the most recent quarter, an 18% online sales increase was fueled by gold bar demand. I surprisingly found (and bought) two tomahawk steaks from my local Costco a few weeks ago for $40 (about five pounds of meat).Costco just does things differently, and it's built into its DNA. The stock has risen in the last five years because members are happy shopping there: +245%.So I wasn't surprised to hear Costco's longtime CFO Richard Galanti (who is retiring soon) reveal it's getting into the sushi business on last night's earnings call:\"We recently opened our first fully operated sushi offering in Issaquah, Washington, across the street from our headquarters, with two more planned to open in the very near future. This operation is what we have successfully done for years \u2014 for many years \u2014 and throughout our Asia Costcos and several countries over there. The sushi program has proven to be a category where we can be successful in both quality and price, and we're looking forward to seeing more of that in the future.\"Sign me up for a California roll, Rich.  The Costco hot dog is on point. At right, now retired Costco CEO Craig Jelinek.  \u00b7 Yahoo Finance     TERMS  AND PRIVACY_POLICY   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  RECOMMENDED_STORIES   MSG_NO_NEWS \n\n\n  COPYRIGHT     POPULAR_QUOTES Dow Jones  S&P 500  DAX Index  Nvidia  Tesla  DJT  Tariffs   EXPLORE_MORE Mortgages  Credit Cards  Sectors  Crypto Heatmap  Financial News   ABOUT Data Disclaimer Help Feedback Sitemap Licensing  What's New About Our Ads  TERMS  AND PRIVACY_POLICY   Privacy Dashboard   More Info    Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsTrending TickersMETAMeta Platforms, Inc.EquityNMSLCIDLucid Group, Inc.EquityNMSNVDANVIDIA CorporationEquityNMSGOOGAlphabet Inc.EquityNMSSRPTSarepta Therapeutics, Inc.EquityNMSRDDTReddit, Inc.EquityNYQ     U.S. markets close in 1h 4m  US  EUROPE  ASIA  RATES  COMMODITIES  CURRENCIES  CRYPTOCURRENCIES     S&P 500  5,622.53 -52.68 (-0.93%)       Dow 30  41,613.46 -228.30 (-0.55%)       Nasdaq  17,555.41 -253.26 (-1.42%)       Russell 2000  2,049.77 -18.56 (-0.90%)       Crude Oil  66.88 -0.70 (-1.04%)       Gold  3,043.30 +37.20 (+1.24%)              MY_PORTFOLIOS    MY_PORTFOLIOS   SIGN_IN_TO_VIEW_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE SIGN_IN   TOP_GAINERS     TNXP Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. 21.00 +4.72 (+28.99%)       FINV FinVolution Group 10.79 +1.67 (+18.31%)       JBSAY JBS S.A. 13.63 +1.98 (+17.00%)       TKAMY thyssenkrupp AG 11.49 +1.44 (+14.33%)       TME Tencent Music Entertainment Group 14.92 +1.85 (+14.20%)         TOP_LOSERS     SRPT Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. 75.77 -25.58 (-25.24%)       RDDT Reddit, Inc. 108.66 -16.90 (-13.46%)       WRBY Warby Parker Inc. 17.77 -2.58 (-12.69%)       BEKE KE Holdings Inc. 22.70 -2.40 (-9.55%)       CVNA Carvana Co. 169.17 -17.33 (-9.29%)         MOST_ACTIVES_MODULE     NVDA NVIDIA Corporation 117.22 -2.31 (-1.93%)       LCID Lucid Group, Inc. 2.3650 +0.2050 (+9.49%)       QBTS D-Wave Quantum Inc. 10.93 -0.25 (-2.24%)       INTC Intel Corporation 26.14 +0.44 (+1.73%)       TSLA Tesla, Inc. 227.09 -10.92 (-4.59%)         TRENDING_TICKERS     META Meta Platforms, Inc. 584.70 -20.20 (-3.34%)       LCID Lucid Group, Inc. 2.3650 +0.2050 (+9.49%)       NVDA NVIDIA Corporation 117.30 -2.24 (-1.87%)       GOOG Alphabet Inc. 162.79 -3.78 (-2.27%)       SRPT Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. 76.19 -25.16 (-24.82%)         TOP_ECONOMIC_EVENTS    TOP_ECONOMIC_EVENTS    Hong Kong    All     MODULE_CALENDAR_EMPTY_MSG MODULE_CALENDAR_ALL_EVENTS_MSG     TERMS  AND PRIVACY_POLICY   Privacy Dashboard  AD_TERMS  FEEDBACK  More Info      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting for permission\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Catherine Brock covers personal finance and investing. for\u00a0Investor HubFollow AuthorMar 13, 2024, 02:35pm EDTUpdated Dec 3, 2024, 12:37pm ESTShareSaveShares of Nvidia have split five times since 2000.Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\nNvidia (NVDA) shareholders have had a good run, watching their stock double in value twice since 2022. NVDA's skyrocketing stock price has done more than produce solid gains for shareholders and feelings of envy from everyone else. It has left the entire investment community wondering, will Nvidia stock split again?\n\n\nLet's explore that question with a look at Nvidia's split history, potential split catalysts, possible outcomes of a split and the likelihood that NVDA will split in 2024.\n\nThe Current State Of Nvidia Stock\nAs of March 12, NVDA trades for about $900 per share. The stock has been on an incredible run since the end of 2022, gaining nearly 500% in 14 months. Year to date in 2024, Nvidia is up 82%\u2014and that's after a 5.6% pullback on March 8. The performance flags Nvidia as one of the best stocks in 2024 so far.\n\nThe force behind that momentum is Nvidia's emergence as an early and profitable leader in artificial intelligence (AI). In its most recent earnings release, Nvidia reported 409% quarter-over-quarter sales growth for the Data Center division that handles its AI products. The growth drove quarterly Data Center revenue to $18.4 billion, which outpaced analysts' lofty expectations.\n\nInvestors, thrilled to see large-scale monetization in AI, scooped up NVDA shares in the second half of February through early-March. There was a brief reversal on March 8, which was likely profit-taking. Investors may have also been spooked by a Citigroup analyst's report noting that Nvidia's market share had slipped slightly in certain categories.\nNVDA's Stock Split History\nNvidia stock split history implies a split will come sooner rather than later. The company has split its stock five times since going public in 1999. You can see the details of those transactions in the table below.\nTable data source: Macrotrends.net.\nNvidia had been aggressive with its split strategy in the early 2000s\u2014keeping the stock price below $100. After 2007, NVDA remained in the two-digit range until 2016. In December 2018, the stock took off, climbing from about $133 to nearly $800 per share by June 2021.\nThat run-up amounted to 470% total growth in roughly 30 months. That's an impressive spike, but less so when compared to Nvidia's most recent gain of nearly 500% in 14 months.\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download Forbes' most popular report, 12 Best Stocks To Buy for 2024.\nMarket Sentiment And Speculation\nCompanies commonly split their stock to lower the share price. The thinking is that a lower share price makes the stock more attractive to a broader range of investors. That fosters a more dynamic trading environment and promotes the stock's liquidity. Liquidity is attractive to investors because it means trade requests can be fulfilled quickly. This is particularly important to institutional investors that trade at scale.\nMarket sentiment and speculation become factors when investor optimism drives a stock price higher, to the point a split becomes a consideration.\nCertainly, investors are excited about AI stocks and Nvidia in particular. That excitement does translate to a higher stock price. But Nvidia has done its part, too. With profitable growth and a dominant market share in AI chips, the company is one of the best tech stocks of 2024.\nIn other words, market sentiment in this case may expedite the need for a split, but it's not the sole factor. Market sentiment will more likely play a bigger role after Nvidia announces a split is coming.\nThis is because split announcements generate buzz and buzz generates buys. Remember the last Tesla stock split in 2022? The stock rose 8% after the split announcement, which was months ahead of the transaction. When Nvidia decides to split its stock, absent any bad news, investors will drive the stock price higher.\nPossible Nvidia Stock Split Catalysts\nThe factors that will more directly impact the timing of NVDA's next split are share price, demand growth for AI and accessibility concerns for the stock.\nNVDA Stock Price\nNVDA's price today is higher than it was the last time the stock split in 2021. Analyst price targets on NVDA range from $275 to $1,100, averaging out to a consensus of $829.66. A split is a possibility if the stock levels out to the low-$800s, but it becomes increasingly likely if NVDA stretches up to $1,000 or more.\nThe Future Of Artificial Intelligence\nNvidia has given investors a taste of AI-related gains. If the growth and profits story in Nvidia's Data Center continues, investors will remain enthusiastic. That will keep the stock price high enough to warrant a split. If the AI outlook levels out or slows, investors won't be forgiving. Many will move on to other growth stories.\nThe interesting thing is that a stock price reversal could also expedite a split. A bullish leadership team could decide to press on with a split to counter negative investment sentiment.\nLiquidity And Accessibility\nNVDA priced at $100 has more potential investors than NVDA priced at $800 or more. The $800 price point is only realistic for investors who buy fractional shares or those who invest at least $1,000 monthly.\nFor context, the average annual salary for adults in the U.S. is $4,948 monthly before taxes. That does not easily support a $1,000 investing budget.\nIf NVDA\u2019s share price rises into the four digits, even fractional share purchases can become less appealing. Fractional brokers allow for trades with as little as $1. A $1 buy on a $1,000 stock equates to 0.001 shares. That sounds far less interesting and motivating than one-tenth of a share that's priced at $100.\nNvidia's leadership team has addressed the accessibility question in the past. In its 2021 split announcement, the company cited the need \"to make stock ownership more accessible to investors and employees.\"\nStop chasing shadows in the market.

They should not change a company's value or a shareholder's returns. The split only redistributes value across a different number of shares. A forward split increases the number of shares and reduces the stock price accordingly.\nStill, splits can affect investor perception, which in turn affects the stock price. Let's look at how that may work in the short and long-term for Nvidia.\nShort-Term Considerations\nA split announcement from Nvidia will be well-received by the investment community in the short term. Investors will interpret the news as added confirmation that Nvidia's management team is optimistic. Investors will also assume a lower stock price will increase the pool of prospective shareholders. Those factors will push NVDA higher after the split announcement and in the days leading up to the split.\nNVDA Stock Long-Term Outlook\nLonger term, an NVDA split in 2024 will have less importance. There is some research indicating that stocks generally outperform after a split, but Nvidia is something of a special case. Investors have already driven the price and the valuation quite high. They're expecting results. If Nvidia doesn't deliver, the stock price will fall. A split won't prevent, delay or minimize that correction.\nAs it stands today, analysts expect Nvidia to produce 80% sales growth in this fiscal year 2025 and 20% in fiscal year 2026.getty\nWill Nvidia Stock Split In 2024?\nBased on Nvidia's split history and its current price, a 2024 split is likely. Analyst Ken Mahoney, president and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, agrees, although with a slightly longer timeline. Mahoney recently told Bloomberg News that he predicts Nvidia will split within 12 months.\nThe split ratio will depend on how the stock performs over the next few months. If NVDA has another standout earnings release that drives the price higher, we could see a six-for-one exchange before year-end. That would give shareholders of record an extra five shares for each one they own on the split date.\nBottom Line\nWith a high stock price, good momentum and an optimistic outlook, Nvidia is poised for a stock split in 2024. A split doesn't change the stock's potential for volatility, so do your research to ensure the move is right before you buy.\nRead Next \n\nThrift Savings Plan Guide: What You Need To Know\nReddit IPO: What To Know Ahead Of March's Planned Launch\n5 Best Semiconductor Stocks For 2024\n\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024.

The artificial intelligence boom remains a potent tailwind for the stock, and investment in the sector will likely remain robust through the next several years as companies ramp up efforts to grab a piece of the pie.Since its earnings announcement in February, Nvidia is up over 25%.On Thursday, Broadcom (AVGO) said that it sees $10 billion in AI-related revenue for 2024. However, AVGO sold off on Friday, in line with the broader sector. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) was down 4.3 points in morning trading as traders took profits on a solid week ahead of the weekend.Market cap approaches Apple, where next?Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization has added over $1 trillion since the start of the year to take it to a total capitalization of over $2 trillion. That puts it close to Apple (AAPL), which boasts a market cap of $2.6 trillion. Apple stock has fallen recently, with slowing iPhone sales dragging on the company\u2019s outlook.With NVDA trading around 900 per share, many traders expect to see another split occur soon. The last stock split was in May 2021, when NVDA traded at $753.03. That four-for-one split took the price down to $187.37, far below where NVDA is trading today.A stock split helps open access for more investors and should ultimately increase liquidity, although Nvidia isn\u2019t having problems with that today.Trading the Nvidia pullbackNvidia\u2019s 5% Friday pullback opens an opportunity for those who have been waiting to get long the stock. On a daily percentage basis, today is the biggest drop since May 2023.For those wanting to take advantage of the relatively high implied volatility, evidenced by an implied volatility rank (IVR) of 93.5, selling a put spread offers a defined risk neutral to bullish play to sell some of that volatility.Thomas Westwater,\u00a0a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience.\u00a0@fxwestwaterFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit tastylive or the YouTube channels tastylive (for options traders), and tastyliveTrending for stocks, futures, forex & macro.Trade with a better broker, open a tastytrade account today. tastylive, Inc. and tastytrade, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

February hiring was ahead of consensus, but January data saw a large-scale revision lower, while the Unemployment Rate rose to match the two-year high at 3.9%.\u00a0\nNvidia closed Friday down 5.6% at $875.28, while the\u00a0S&P 500 fell\u00a00.65% and\u00a0the NASDAQ dropped 1.16% in an unusually volatile session. Arm Holdings (ARM), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) all ended the session lower as well.\nNvidia stock news: February NFP, Unemployment leads market lower\nOn Friday morning, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy added 275K jobs in the month of February. That figure was well above the 200K that was previously estimated.\nHowever, the market focused on the deep revision to January\u2019s figure. Arguably, January\u2019s spike to 353K was the primary cause for Wall Street and the Federal Reserve (Fed) pushing out the schedule for the first cut to interest rates to June. In this report, the January figure was trimmed all the way to 229K. That makes the market wonder if February\u2019s 275K figure won\u2019t eventually be revised much lower as well.\nAt the same time, the Unemployment Rate rose to 3.9%, which was a large-scale difference from the previous month\u2019s 3.7% print. Investors compared the jump in unemployment to the month\u2019s Average Hourly Earnings data, which only rose 0.1% from January. That rate was well below the 0.3% consensus and January rate of 0.5%. Together some analysts view the February report as a sign that the US economy is dimming.\nLess dynamism in the economy and a looser labor market should give the Fed more reason to cut rates sooner, but the market on Friday seems worried that the data might be telling a more worrisome story. US Treasury yields fell for all tenures besides the 30-year as investors stormed into the safe asset at a strong pace.\nIn other news, the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, called the Big Fund, in China has proposed raising another $27 billion for a third semiconductor investment vehicle. The Big Fund has already put $45 billion to work in the domestic chip industry in order to build up Chinese self-sufficiency in the realm of semiconductors.\u00a0\nThe Biden administration has ramped up sanctions against supplying the leading\u00a0chips like Nvidia's H100 to Chinese corporations, so this fund would aim its sights on investments that could counter the Western sanctions by producing AI-enabled chips at home.\nNvidia stock forecast\nNvidia stock is pulling back on Friday in what seems quite necessary since the stock has been on the warpath north all year. Just on Thursday, NVDA stock reached an all-time high of $927.67, reaching a $2.3 trillion market cap. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been overbought for some time, which typically requires a period of consolidation, otherwise known as a cooling-off period.\nNvidia's intraday low was at $865. If it drops below here, both $840 and $800 are the next levels to watch. March 4 and March 5 experienced bottoms near $840, while $800 buffered\u00a0the price action from February 26 through March 1, acting as both resistance and support. The 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is also gunning for the $800 level, which provides its with more significance. Otherwise, a major pullback could send NVDA stock back to retouch the top of the upper trendline at $730 that held Nvidia stock down from 2020 through February of this year.\n\n\nNVDA daily stock chart\n\nShare:\n\n  Feed news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

If you are looking to add one of these two AI stocks to your portfolio right now, which one should you be buying?\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia has been the go-to supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for major cloud computing companies looking to train AI models. The demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs was so strong last year that its customers were waiting for as long as 11 months to get their hands on the company's hardware, according to investment bank UBS.\nNvidia's efforts to manufacture more AI chips and meet this heightened customer demand have been successful, allowing it to lower the wait time to three to four months. This goes some way to explaining why the company's growth has been stunning in recent quarters.\n\nNVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (for the three months ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue shot up a whopping 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings jumped 486% to $5.16 per share.\nThat eye-popping growth is set to continue in the current quarter. Nvidia's revenue estimate of $24 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 would translate into a year-over-year gain of 233%.\nAnalysts are expecting the company's earnings to jump to $5.51 per share in the current quarter, which would be a 5x increase over the year-ago period's reading of $1.09 per share. Even better, Nvidia should be able to sustain its impressive momentum for the rest of the fiscal year as well, especially since it expects the demand for its upcoming AI GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture to exceed supply.\n\nNvidia management pointed out on its February earnings conference call that, although the supply of its current-generation chips is improving, the next-generation products will be \"supply constrained.\" That won't be surprising, as Nvidia's upcoming AI GPUs, which will start shipping later in 2024, are reportedly four times more powerful when training AI models as compared to the current H100 processor.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia also expects a 30 times increase in the AI inference performance with its Blackwell AI GPUs. This should help it cater to a fast-growing segment of the AI chip market, as the market for AI inference chips is expected to grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $91 billion in 2030, according to reporting from Verified Market Research.\nThe good part is that customers are already lining up for Nvidia's Blackwell processors, with Meta Platforms expecting to train future generations of its Llama large language model (LLM) using the latest chips.\nAll this explains why analysts are forecasting Nvidia's earnings to increase from $12.96 per share in fiscal 2024 to almost $37 per share in fiscal 2027. That translates into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 42%, suggesting that Nvidia could remain a top AI growth play going forward.\nThe case for Micron Technology\nThe booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is turning out to be a solid tailwind for Micron Technology. That's because Nvidia's AI GPUs are powered by high-bandwidth memory (HBM) from the likes of Micron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn its recent earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that Nvidia will be deploying its HBM chips in the H200 processors, which are set to be available to customers beginning in the second quarter. Micron management also added that it is \"making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.\"\nThe demand for Micron's HBM chips is so strong that it has sold out its entire capacity for 2024. What's more, the memory specialist says that \"the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated,\" indicating that AI will continue to drive robust demand for Micron's chips.\n Micron is also looking to push the envelope in the HBM market. The company has started sampling a new HBM chip with 50% higher memory, which will allow the likes of Nvidia to make more powerful AI chips going forward. As such, booming HBM demand will positively impact Micron's financials, with the company estimating that it will \"generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024.\"\nThe HBM market is expected to generate almost $17 billion in revenue this year -- accounting for 20% of overall DRAM industry revenue -- as compared to $4.4 billion in 2023. Even better, it could keep getting bigger in the long run on the back of the fast-growing AI chip market. As a result, Micron should be able to sustain the impressive growth it has started clocking now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's revenue in the recently reported fiscal second quarter of 2024 (which ended on Feb. 29) was up 57% year over year to $5.82 billion. The revenue guidance of $6.6 billion for the ongoing quarter would be a bigger jump of 76% from the year-ago period. So, Micron's aggressive AI-driven growth is just getting started.\u00a0\nThe verdict\nGiven the data above, Micron may turn out to be the better AI play compared to Nvidia because of one simple reason: At almost 37 times sales, Nvidia stock is way more expensive when compared to Micron's price-to-sales ratio of 6.4. Also, Micron is significantly cheaper than Nvidia as far as the forward earnings multiple is concerned.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts\nOf course, Nvidia is growing at a much faster pace than Micron, and it could justify its expensive valuation by sustaining its terrific growth. However, investors looking for a cheaper way to play the AI boom are likely to consider Micron for their portfolios, considering its attractive valuation and the rapid growth it offers right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The stock just seems to keep going higher with no end in sight. And as shares attain new heights, it is only reasonable to think at some point NVDA stock has to return to earth.\nAnd yet every day the never-ending rally never ends. An NVDA stock analysis indicates gravity will take hold at some point but it raises the question, does it really matter? If the long-term outlook for the stock is as good as some suggest, then a return trip from the stratosphere should be welcome.\nHere\u2019s a look at what investors can expect from Nvidia in the not-so-distant future.\nAn unstoppable juggernaut\nThe temptation to take money off the table is great. After more than tripling in value last year, NVDA stock is up another 73% so far in 2024, adding roughly $925 billion to its market cap since Jan. 2. And we\u2019re only eight weeks into the new year! From its bottom in October 2022, Nvidia shares have soared 650%. At some point it has to come to an end, right? Right?!\nWell, sort of. The stock is riding the tsunami of artificial intelligence (AI) demand. Its shares are leapfrogging the valuation of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to become the third-largest stock in the world by capitalization. It was always a foregone conclusion Nvidia would achieve a $2 trillion valuation. And now people wonder if it will soon join Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $3 trillion.\nHedge funds, however, started selling down their positions early. In the fourth quarter, Joel Greenblatt at Gotham Asset Management reduced his stake by 16%, David Tepper at Appaloosa cut his 23%, and Cathie Wood slashed her holdings in her Ark Invest funds by more than 34%. Wood continues to sell off NVDA stock in 2024, cutting another 31% from her holdings. She now owns less than 80,000 shares from a peak of 1.3 million back in 2022. Did they sell too soon?\nAn unassailable vantage point\nThere is no reason Nvidia should stop growing, at least not for the foreseeable future. Demand for AI accelerators, including graphics processing units (GPUs) at data centers, continues unabated. Especially for hyper-scalers like Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), their needs are only escalating.\u00a0\nAs CFO Collette Kress told analysts, \u201cthe enterprise wave of AI adoption is beginning,\u201d and its crest has not yet peaked. Nvidia is firing on all cylinders, and its earnings report last month only confirms that the business is still chugging along.\nThere is also no credible threat to Nvidia on the horizon. Both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) want to steal a piece of the action and likely will at some point. But especially in the AI market, they are not going to topple Nvidia from the throne in any meaningful way.\nAlthough Nvidia\u2019s chips cost more than comparable ones from the competition, the chipmaker\u2019s ecosystem will keep most of its customers close to home. The Cuda platform integrates well with its chips making the tools easy to use while allowing customers to build out their own applications.\nBe ready for the dip\nYes, one day NVDA stock will stall out. AI mania will ebb, sales will slow, and the stock will tumble. No company can continue growing at the pace Nvidia is today. It will fall and may even fall hard. But long-term investors should welcome any discount the market is willing to share.\nThat\u2019s because AI is in the early innings of a long game. There is no telling how big the need will be. Some analysts talk about multi-trillion-dollar opportunities. Nvidia is a company that will just grow right alongside it. For bold investors who won\u2019t be shaken out, any decline will represent a chance to scoop up even more stock at a lower price just before Nvidia begins the next leg of its journey higher.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It produces the advanced chips for data centers where developers build, train, and deploy their AI models. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) are best-in-class for those applications.  Nvidia stock has more than tripled over the last 12 months, carrying the company to a $2.2 trillion valuation. Only Apple and Microsoft are worth more. Nvidia will likely continue to create value for investors, so I'm being facetious when I tell you to forget about the company. But the AI industry is evolving quickly and a number of other stocks in the chip space are also surging. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock just hit a record high of $113.50, surpassing its previous best-ever level from two years ago. Here's why it's not too late to buy. The data center isn't the only game in town when it comes to AI Micron is one of the world's leading producers of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, both of which are increasingly important to extracting maximum performance from Nvidia's data center GPUs. In fact, Nvidia chose Micron's HBM3E memory solution to power its latest H200 chip, which is the successor to its industry-leading H100. Micron's HBM3E memory consumes an estimated 30% less energy than competing hardware, and reducing electricity usage is a growing focus for data center operators due to the sheer amount of computing power commanded by AI workloads. Therefore, it's no surprise that Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is completely sold out for calendar 2024, and most of its calendar 2025 supply has also been allocated already.  But Micron's AI opportunity is now expanding beyond the data center. Every new computer and mobile device will soon be fitted with AI processors, which will speed up response times and improve the user experience. The chipsets inside next-generation computers are called neural processing units (NPUs) and are specifically designed to handle AI workloads. They require up to 80% more DRAM content than today's average PC chips, and that translates to more revenue for Micron. In the mobile space, Micron expects AI-enabled smartphones to carry up to double the DRAM content compared to traditional models. Micron's AI chips can be found in Samsung's new Galaxy S24 device, which comes with a host of AI features. One of them is Live Translate, which allows two people to speak over the phone in different languages, and another is Circle to Search, which recognizes objects in photos and allows the user to instantly run an online search.   Story Continues On-device processing is the industry's next frontier, because it will take AI out of the data center and insert it into everyday life. Demand is already soaring; Advanced Micro Devices is a leader in AI CPU and NPU technologies, and it has shipped millions of AI-enabled computers to date.Micron has returned to profitabilityMicron's revenue plunged by 50% during fiscal 2023 (ended Aug. 31, 2023), dragging the company's bottom line to a net loss of $5.8 billion for the year. Pandemic-related supply shortages caused the chip industry to overproduce, leading to an inventory glut and plummeting prices.Micron has now emerged from that period. The company's revenue returned to growth in the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), although it still lost more than $1.2 billion at the bottom line. But the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29, 2024) was a true breakout period for the company.Micron delivered $5.8 billion in revenue, which was a whopping 57% year-over-year increase, and it also crushed the company's forecast of $5.3 billion. Plus, it generated a net income of $793 million, which marked a welcome return to profitability.CEO Sanjay Mehrotra attributed the strong quarter to a tightening supply demand balance, which had a positive impact on prices across all end markets. However, he also gave a nod to the strength in AI server (data center) demand.Micron is forecasting $6.6 billion in revenue for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1), which would represent an increase of 76% compared to the year-ago period. That would be a powerful growth acceleration from the second quarter.  Image source: Getty Images.  Why Micron stock is a buy despite trading at an all-time highSince Micron was losing money up until Q2, investors can't use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value its stock. However, based on the company's trailing-12-month revenue of $18.3 billion and its current market capitalization of $122 billion, Micron stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7.That's extremely cheap compared to Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 37, and even Advanced Micro Devices stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 12.9. Those names deserve a premium because their work in the GPU, CPU, and NPU spaces is unprecedented, and they effectively create demand for Micron's products.However, AI is expected to add anywhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy over the next 10 years, and Micron's hardware is a key component to unlocking that value creation. The company is ramping up the pace of innovation; it's now sampling its 12-high HBM3E data center product, which increases DRAM capacity by 50%. That means companies like Nvidia can pack more memory into each GPU, which leads to faster training and inferencing, paving the way for more advanced AI models.With Micron's revenue growth clearly accelerating, the all-time high in its stock shouldn't deter investors from buying it -- especially considering its valuation and the substantial opportunity that lies ahead.Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

Discover how to track all 535 Congress member stock trades today.\r\nTechnology giant NVIDIA Corp NVDA passed the $1 trillion milestone for market capitalization in 2023, cementing its place as one of the most valuable companies worldwide. At its recent GTC 2024, the company\u2019s cemented its place in the artificial intelligence world.\nShares of the chip company ended 2023 as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500, marking a big win for investors who have been believers in the company for a year or more. Investors who have been betting on Nvidia since its IPO have been rewarded significantly more.\nHere's a look at how much investors in the company's IPO have made.\nInvesting $1,000 in Nvidia at IPO: Nvidia held its initial price offering on Jan. 22, 1999, with shares priced at $12 each.\nA $1,000 investment in the company would have been able to buy 83.33 shares at the time.\nSince its IPO, Nvidia had several stock splits that increased the number of shares held by shareholders. The stock had 2:1 splits in 2000, 2001 and 2006, a 3:2 split in 2007 and a 4:1 split in July 2021.\nToday, the original 83.33 shares would total 3,999.84 shares after the stock splits.\nToday, the original $1,000 investment in Nvidia stock would be worth $3,575,696.97 based on a share price of $893.96. This represents a huge return for Nvidia IPO buyers with some potential millionaires created over the years.\nFor comparison, the same $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, which tracks the S&P 500, would have underperformed Nvidia.\nA $1,000 investment in SPY stock could have bought 12.82 shares at the time, based on an adjusted price of $78.03 on Jan. 22, 1999.\nThe $1,000 invested in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust would be worth $6,601.02 today.\nRelated Link: Nvidia Q4 Earnings Highlights: Revenue Beat, EPS Beat, Q1 Guidance And More\nWhat Happened: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the company's growth with increased interest in artificial intelligence at its GTC 2024 event.\n\"There is absolutely something happening, something going on. The industry is being transformed,\" Huang said.\nThe Nvidia CEO and co-founder called the computer the single most important instrument today, because it affects every industry.\nWhile Huang and Nvidia saw technology advancement coming, the CEO said ChatGPT helped capture the imagination of consumers and the capabilities of AI.\n\"A new industry has emerged.\"\nSince its founding in 1993, Nvidia has sought to be at the forefront of technological advancements to help new industrial advancements.\nIn 1999, the company invented the Graphics Processing Unit, commonly known as GPU today. The GPU redefined the computer industry.\nIn 2012, Nvidia ushered in the modern era of AI with the AlexNet neural network, potentially showing the company ahead of others when it came to belief in the capabilities of artificial intelligence.\nIn March 2024. the company unveiled the Blackwell GPU, which could help the company further disrupt the growth of artificial intelligence.\nNvidia continues to draw praise from analysts as one of the best plays on the growth of artificial intelligence.\nThe company transformed over the years and has taken advantage of several industrial revolutions, with AI having the potential to help the company go even higher. Nvidia has been a top performer once again in 2024 to date, surpassing the $2 trillion market capitalization and joining even more elite company.\nThe big question for investors today is if Nvidia will keep outperforming the overall market and being one of the top-performing stocks going forward.\nRead Next: If You Invested $1,000 In NVIDIA Stock When Nancy Pelosi And Her Husband Did, Here\u2019s How Much You\u2019d Have Now\nPhoto: ShutterstockNVDANVIDIA Corp$116.74-2.33%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewSPYSPDR S&P 500$561.03-1.08%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Its share price soared 245% over the past year as businesses clamored to buy its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become synonymous with AI.\u00a0But analysts at Goldman Sachs see Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as a leader in the second and fourth phases of AI, and Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) as a leader in the third phase.  The four phases are detailed below. Investors should not think of them as distinct events, but rather as a continuum where a new phase can begin well before the previous one has ended. In other words, all four periods will overlap to some degree. Phase 1: Semiconductor companies will generate revenue from chips designed to support AI workloads. Phase 2: Cloud businesses will produce revenue by providing access to AI infrastructure. Phase 3: Cloud companies will generate revenue by incorporating AI into software and services. Phase 4: Many different kinds of organizations will use AI internally to improve operational efficiency.  The Goldman analyst team has made sensible selections. Amazon is the largest cloud services provider in the world and the company is already using AI to make its logistics business more efficient. Similarly, Cloudflare has a substantial opportunity to monetize AI through its Workers developer platform, so much so that management believes it could be a leader in AI inferencing. Read on to find out why both stocks could be worthwhile long-term investments. 1. Amazon Amazon is best known for its e-commerce empire. The company operates the most visited online marketplace in the world, and it has reinforced its leadership position by investing heavily in logistics capabilities. That strategy not only allows Amazon to control costs, but also enables the company to support sellers with fulfillment services and delight buyers with timely delivery. Meanwhile, Amazon has used its dominance in online retail to create a thriving advertising business. In fact, Amazon has become the third-largest adtech company in the world, and Wedbush Securities analyst Scott Devitt believes it \"is well positioned to continue taking share of global digital advertising spending over a multi-year period.\"  Finally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top dog in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and it has achieved a strong presence in several subcategories of the cloud computing market. Most notably, consultancy Gartner recently recognized AWS as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) developer services.   Story Continues Amazon looked strong in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 14% to $170 billion due to momentum in e-commerce and advertising, as well as a sequential acceleration in cloud computing revenue. Meanwhile, GAAP net income reached $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year, indicating that cost-control efforts are paying off.Looking ahead, AI should be a tailwind for Amazon, both in terms of improving efficiency and boosting revenue. For instance, the company is using machine learning to optimize inventory and delivery routes. That should support continued margin expansion, especially in conjunction with its new regional fulfillment strategy, which reduced shipping costs on a per-unit basis in 2023 for the first time since 2018, according to CEO Andy Jassy.Meanwhile, Amazon recently introduced Bedrock, a cloud service for building generative AI applications. The company also announced Amazon Q, a generative AI business assistant. Both products create new monetization opportunities that should help Amazon tap growing demand for AI. Indeed, Jassy believes investments in AI will \"drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.\"Going forward, Wall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow revenue by 11% annually over the next five years. That estimate makes its current valuation of 3.2 times sales seem reasonable, though it is a slight premium to the three-year average of 2.9 times sales.I think Goldman has the right idea where Amazon is concerned. Patient investors should consider buying a few shares of this top AI stock today.2. CloudflareCloudflare provides application, network, and security services that improve the performance of corporate infrastructure and software across public clouds and private data centers. Additionally, the company offers compute and storage services through its Workers developer platform that help businesses build and deploy applications, and it has been particularly focused on enabling artificial intelligence.Last year, CEO Matthew Prince said, \"By our estimates, Cloudflare is the most commonly used cloud provider across leading AI start-ups.\" He also stated that the company was \"uniquely positioned to become a leader in AI inferencing.\" Prince was referring to Workers AI, a recently launched service that lets businesses run AI applications on Nvidia GPUs installed across its network.Cloudflare operates the fastest cloud network on the market, and Forrester Research recently recognized the company as the leader in edge development platforms. Those qualities could indeed help Cloudflare become a major player in the AI inferencing market, despite tough competition from Amazon and Microsoft.Cloudflare reported strong fourth-quarter financial results. Its customer count climbed 17% and the average existing customer spent 15% more over the past year. In turn, revenue increased 32% to $362 million in the fourth quarter, and non-GAAP net income more than doubled to $53 million. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continueGoing forward, Grand View Research believes the edge computing market will grow by 37% annually through 2030, and Cloudflare is poised to capitalize on that opportunity given its strong position in edge development platforms. But the International Data Corp. has also ranked Cloudflare as a leader in zero-trust network access, and that market is forecast to expand by 17% annually through 2030.Collectively, Cloudflare has a good shot at 20% annual revenue growth through the end of the decade, and that estimate could be conservative depending on how well the company monetizes AI. Either way, its present valuation of 23.7 times sales is tolerable. To be clear, that multiple is not cheap, so shares will almost certainly be volatile. But patient investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a small position in this growth stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

That's because shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader have been performing fantastically, and investors are optimistic about the company's long-term growth potential.\nIf you're considering investing in Nvidia stock, it's extremely helpful to know how the company makes its money.\nWhere is Nvidia's revenue coming from? \nThe following chart shows the company's revenue breakdown by platform for its most recently reported quarter.\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\nRevenue Fiscal Q4 2024 (Ended Jan. 28)\n\n\nPercentage of Total Fiscal Q4 2024 Revenue*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData center\n\n$18.4 billion\n\n\n83%\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n$2.9 billion\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\nProfessional visualization\n\n$463 million\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\nAutomotive\n$281 million\n1%\n\n\nOEM and other\n$90 million\nLess than 1%\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$22.1 billion\n\n100%\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. OEM = original equipment manufacturer; OEM and other is not a target market platform. *Calculations by author.\nTogether, Nvidia's data center and gaming platforms accounted for 96% of its total revenue in its most recently reported quarter. So, the performances of its other platforms currently make little difference in the company's overall financial results.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's dynamic duo platforms: Data center & gaming\nNvidia's data center platform supplies graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and related products for speeding up the processing of AI and high-performance computing workloads. This platform's revenue growth has significantly revved up over the last year because companies and other entities across industries are hungry to acquire generative AI capabilities. This new tech, which powers OpenAI's wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot, greatly increases the potential applications for AI.\nDemand for Nvidia's data center GPU, the H100, and related products has been so mighty that the company's supply can't keep up with it. Moreover, management expects powerful demand for the H100's successors launching this year -- H200 and B100, the first GPU based on the company's new Blackwell architecture.\nNvidia is the world's No. 1 supplier of graphics cards -- under the GeForce brand -- for computer gaming, a market that has grown steadily. In the fourth quarter of 2023, it had an 80% share of the desktop discrete GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) captured a 19% share, while market newcomer Intel had a 1% share.\nHow fast are Nvidia's platforms growing revenue?\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\nFiscal Q4 2024 Revenue Growth YOY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData center\n409%\n\n\nGaming\n56%\n\n\nProfessional visualization\n105%\n\n\nAutomotive\n(4%)\n\n\nOEM and other\n7%\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n265%\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. YOY = year over year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the top table, Nvidia's data center platform accounted for 83% of its total revenue in its most recently reported quarter. This percentage will continue to rise if the data center continues to grow faster than the other platforms.\n\nWhere is Nvidia's profit coming from?\nNvidia doesn't break out any form of profits by platform in its quarterly earnings releases. But we can make good deductions about this topic by using data it provided in its recent 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In this document, Nvidia breaks out its fiscal year 2024 revenue and operating income by its two reporting segments, and lists what business components are included in each segment. \n\n\n\n\nSegment\n\n\nRevenue Fiscal Year 2024 (Ended Jan. 28)\n\n\nPercentage of Total Fiscal Year 2024 Revenue* \n\n\nOperating Income Fiscal Year 2024\n\n\nPercentage of Total Fiscal Year 2024 Segment Operating Income*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute and networking\n$47.4 billion\n78%\n\n$32.0 billion\n\n85%\n\n\nGraphics\n$13.5 billion\n22%\n$5.9 billion\n15%\n\n\nSegment total\n$60.9 billion\n100%\n$37.9 billion\n100%\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. *Calculations by author.\nThe compute and networking segment is more profitable than the graphics segment. In Nvidia's fiscal year ended Jan. 28, the compute and networking segment's operating income (or operating profit) contributed 78% of the company's total revenue, and an even greater percentage of its total segment operating income. The opposite is true of the graphics segment.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly all parts of the data center platform are included in the compute and networking segment, according to the 10-K filing. So, we can deduct from this fact and the chart data that Nvidia's data center platform is more profitable than its overall business.\nA winning formula for Nvidia stock\nNvidia's profits (or \"earnings\") are growing faster than its revenue because its fastest growing platform, the data center, is more profitable than its overall business. This is a winning formula for powering its stock price higher.\nThis dynamic is poised to continue for the quarter ending in late April. Management has guided for the quarter's revenue to grow 234% and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to soar 396% year over year.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

The stock nearly tripled over two months, and its performance since the start of 2023 has also been impressive, rising around 900% in total.\nIn that time, few companies come close to matching the performance of Super Micro Computer (often called Supermicro), including artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%). But does that make Supermicro a better AI stock than Nvidia?\nSupermicro and Nvidia's businesses are closely tied\nUsing the term \"better\" when comparing stocks is too broad to be analytically useful. It can mean comparing past performance, future prospects, or the underlying business. I'll look at all three factors to determine if Supermicro is better than Nvidia.\nEven though Nvidia is a strong performer, Supermicro's stock rise since 2023 blows Nvidia out of the water. So if we're talking about past performance, Supermicro takes the cake. Knowing this tidbit of information doesn't do you much good unless you have a time machine, though. Instead, I'll focus on the underlying business and potential future stock performance.\n\nSupermicro and Nvidia are closely tied. Both companies benefited from the rise of AI through their primary product lines. While Nvidia makes top-notch graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used to power AI workloads, Supermicro makes the servers that these GPUs go into to be efficiently used. While some of the larger tech firms have staff to help design the computing architecture, many do not. So smaller companies use Supermicro's highly customizable servers to meet their computing needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes me prefer Nvidia, as it controls the more desirable product. With Nvidia's GPUs in a class of their own in terms of AI computing power, customers have few choices to turn to if they want something different. Supermicro has competitors like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, so Nvidia's path to success is a little clearer.\nAdditionally, this allows Nvidia to have more control over its pricing, which plays out in its margin profile.\n\nSMCI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\nWith Nvidia's gross profit and net income margin much higher than Supermicro's, it can absorb pricing changes without fully losing profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis alone makes me prefer Nvidia to Supermicro. But what about future prospects?\nNvidia is a cheaper stock than Supermicro\nRegarding valuation, Nvidia is cheaper than Supermicro despite its better business position.\n\nSMCI PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nOne area in which Supermicro will pass Nvidia is its revenue growth rate. Although Nvidia expects an impressive 234% growth rate in Q1 FY 2025, this will soon slow. After Q1, Nvidia starts to overlap quarters where GPU demand was incredibly high, so its growth rate will slow even though the company is still doing well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Supermicro's growth is just starting to reach these levels, as its growth projections for Q3 FY 2024 (ending March 31) are anywhere from 188% to 219%. But even though Supermicro's growth rate is starting to accelerate, it doesn't mean it's a cheap stock --\u00a0especially when we utilize its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which considers analyst growth projections.\nSo while Supermicro will continue to put up flashy numbers, I think Nvidia is the better buy here. With the stock being cheaper and having a stronger underlying business model, it's still the king of AI investments. That's not to say Supermicro is a bad company; it's that the stock has gotten too expensive for what it is.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

John Ballard, The Motley Fool   March 4, 2024 5 min read        10   In This Article:  NVDA          AAPL               Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has delivered market-smashing returns for investors. The graphics chip leader's share price has rocketed 1,900% over the last five years, outpacing the broader market and Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) 317% return. Nvidia's superior returns reflect the tremendous growth it has experienced from data center customers for its high-powered graphics processors. However, Apple is the more valuable company right now, with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, and that is likely to increase as it wins more customers with the iPhone. This means Nvidia, which has a market of just under $2 trillion, will likely have to keep growing at high rates to surpass Apple's market value. Let's see what Apple could be worth in six years and whether Nvidia can beat it. Apple stock could rise as much as 80% using Wall Street's growth expectations Apple has a diverse revenue stream coming from a roster of several products and services, but the iPhone is still the cash machine, making up 42% of the company's revenue in fiscal 2023. Dependency on the iPhone has made Apple's revenue growth inconsistent in recent years, but overall, Apple is benefiting from its growing installed base of devices, which is now over 2.2 billion and could keep growing for several more years.  The global smartphone market is expected to increase by a total of 1.5 billion users by 2029, according to Statista. If Apple captures 20% of that increase, consistent with its recent share of the global smartphone market, that would add another 300 million customers for the iPhone. That could significantly increase the company's installed base of devices as some of those customers go on to buy other products. The Wall Street consensus has Apple's annual revenue reaching $512 billion by fiscal 2027, which would be annualized growth of 7.5% from last year's total. Analysts project Apple's earnings per share to grow at a compound rate of 9.4% over the long term. It reported earnings per share of $6.13 last year, so that would put the company's earnings in 2030 at $11.64. If Apple stock is still trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28, the stock price would trade at $325 in 2030, or 80% above its current share price. Assuming Apple's shares outstanding remain constant, its market cap (stock price times shares outstanding) would also increase by 80% and reach $5 trillion in six years. Nvidia's growth hinges on AI spending Nvidia's market cap is currently $1.95 trillion, so its share price would have to more than double to match Apple's projected market cap of $5 trillion in six years.   Story Continues The good news is that Nvidia is experiencing surging demand for its chip hardware as data centers start upgrading their systems to train a computer to learn by itself. Spending on artificial intelligence (AI) technology is projected to grow from $200 billion to $1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Statista.Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) used for playing video games and powering incredibly complicated computing models for AI training, robotics, and self-driving cars. However, data center revenue made up 78% of the business last year and grew 217%.As that triple-digit level of growth suggests, it's got a long growth runway. Most of Nvidia's data center growth has recently come from large cloud providers, but other industries are starting to invest in AI infrastructure, including healthcare and financial services.Analysts expect Nvidia's total revenue to triple by 2027 to $192 billion. Earnings are projected to grow 35% per year, which would put its future earnings at $105 by 2030.Nvidia trades at a high P/E based on its trailing earnings, but looking ahead to this year's estimate, it trades at a more reasonable forward P/E of 32. Assuming Nvidia is still trading at the same forward P/E, its stock price could reach $3,360 by the end of 2030, or 328% above the current share price. That would put its market cap at over $8 trillion.Nvidia stock is the better buyThe GPU is essential to power the stringent demands on data processing that AI requires, and this market is dominated by a duopoly between Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. What makes Nvidia a safe bet is that it has led the GPU market for many years and currently controls an estimated 80% share of AI chips. Nvidia is more dominant in GPUs than Apple is in smartphones.Nvidia appears to be on track to not only exceed Apple's market cap but potentially become the most valuable company in the world in the next decade.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Is the Stock a Buy Near Its All-Time High?      Danny Vena, The Motley Fool   March 12, 2024 2 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         There's no denying that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for artificial intelligence (AI). Its chips have become the industry standard for creating and running AI models, which has kicked its stock into overdrive, soaring roughly 500% since the start of 2023. One Wall Street analyst believes this is just the beginning.   Image source: Getty Images.   Profiting from the AI gold rush Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse boosted his price target to $1,200 while maintaining a buy rating on Nvidia stock. This represents gains of almost 40% compared to the stock's closing price on Monday. The analyst believes investors are underestimating the company's software business, which has already achieved a $1 billion run rate annually and is \"only in the first inning.\" The analyst further suggests generative AI will largely run in data centers, which could be a \"$500 billion business for Nvidia,\" pushing earnings per share (EPS) to $35 next year. The road to $1,200 The analyst could be on to something. Just last month, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the opportunity: There's about a trillion dollars' worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we'll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering [AI] software around the world.  This is contingent on the continued adoption of generative AI, but most market commentators believe it's still early days. Data centers will need to increase their capabilities in order to keep up with the greater computational demands required by AI. Nvidia dominates the data center market with an estimated 95% share. Furthermore, Nvidia is the gold standard for machine learning -- an established branch of AI -- with a 95% share of that market.  All the pieces are in place for Nvidia to maintain its dominance. Furthermore, if Nvidia earns $35 per share next year, a stock price of $1,200 works out to a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 34, so the stock would be a steal at its current price.

The chip giant made a relatively small investment, spending nearly $3.7 million to take a 0.6% stake in the company. The investment was one of five that Nvidia made in tech companies related to artificial intelligence (AI) in the fourth quarter of 2023. \nSo what exactly does SoundHound AI do, and should investors follow in Nvidia's footsteps and invest in the stock?\n\nCarving a niche in voice AI\nBefore Nvidia's investment in the company came to light, SoundHound AI was not exactly well-known. However, the company has relationships with a number of large automobile companies that use its technology to help power their voice assistant technologies. The company's platform is incorporated into devices, such as automobiles, and its AI technology helps voice assistants interact with users in a more natural and conversational manner.\nSoundHound AI's platform, which it calls Houndify, achieves this in two primary ways. First, it uses speech-to-meaning technology, which processes speech in real-time so the device understands its meaning even before the user is done talking. Next, it uses deep-meaning-understanding technology to help understand a user's intent and answer complex questions.\nAn example of its technology at work would be a voice assistant that is able to give hotel recommendations when given a list of variables, such as location, price ranges, amenities, and star ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMaking progress in the automobile and quick-service restaurant verticals\nThe area in which SoundHound AI has made the most progress selling into is the automotive industry. The company has relationships with over 20 auto brands, including Honda, Jeep, Hyundai, Fiat, Chrysler, and RAM, among others. In conjunction with its fourth-quarter earnings report, it said it won a deal with a prominent U.S.-based EV maker and signed another contract with a large automaker to significantly increase its unit volumes through 2037.\nThe company has also been making big strides in the quick-service restaurant vertical. Its SoundHound for Restaurants voice assistant will take phone orders so employees don't have to answer calls and can instead focus on helping customers. It also has solutions for drive-thrus and kiosks.\nThe company has signed deals with restaurant-focused fintech companies such as Toast and Olo, as well as quick-service chains such as White Castle and Jersey Mike's, among others.\nSoundHound AI's strength in the automobile and restaurant verticals helped it grow its revenue by 47% in 2023 to $45.9 million. Meanwhile, for 2024, it forecast revenue of between $63 million and $77 million, which is nearly 53% growth at the midpoint. It said it was looking for revenue to exceed $100 million in 2025. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that is solid growth, SoundHound AI's cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million is more interesting. This metric represents the potential revenue the company expects to generate over the duration of its signed contracts. Currently, the average duration of its contracted backlog is six and a half years, so much of the revenue from these contracts should be recognized before the end of 2031, although some contracts extend out longer. \nA speculative investment\nIt's easy to see why Nvidia likes SoundHound, with the company growing quickly and having a large revenue backlog. It also isn't difficult to imagine that SoundHound AI's technology can be applied to other industries as well, which could accelerate its growth.\nThe two companies also recently announced a collaboration where SoundHound AI will offer on-chip voice AI that doesn't need internet connectivity using Nvidia's DRIVE platform. The solution will allow users to access SoundHound AI's Vehicle Intelligence offering, where users can ask auto-specific questions, such as what it means when a dash light is on, as well as general questions, such as finding the best place to eat nearby. \n\nSOUN PS Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, with SoundHound stock trading at an over 26x price-to-sales ratio and the company currently unprofitable, the stock is very speculative at this point. Its technology looks impressive, but AI technology is evolving quickly. What could seem like cutting-edge technology today could become commoditized in the future. While its cumulative backlog is impressive, that only equates to about $100 million a year in revenue over the average duration of its contracts, so the company has a long way to grow into its current valuation.\nAs such, I recommend that investors keep their positions small if they want to follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock, as they should with Nvidia itself.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Seiler has positions in Toast.

However, prices are still up 60% year-to-date, CoinDesk data shows. Nvidia has pulled back 9% from its lifetime peak of $974 but still boasts a year-to-date gain of 77.5%.STORY CONTINUES BELOWDon't miss another story.Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today.

Similarly, Nvidia\u2019s market value has increased to over $2 trillion from around $100 billion.The growing demand for Nvidia processors from ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) projects has been primarily responsible for the surge in the chip makers\u2019 valuations.The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two has risen to 0.86, the highest since May 2023, having flipped positive in November, according to charting platform TradingView. The 52-week correlation has been consistently positive since July 2020 and has now risen to 0.88, the highest since January 2023.A coefficient of over 0.80 indicates that bitcoin and NVDA are highly correlated and tend to move in the same direction.52-week correlation between BTC and NVDA. (TradingView/CoinDesk) The statistical relationship is noteworthy, as some market observers, including investment management firm GMO, worry that the AI frenzy is similar to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.The launch of ChatGPT in December 2022 helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence, and the subsequent love affair with AI stocks represents a \u201cbubble within a bubble,\u201d which could start to deflate,\u201d GMO\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist Jeremy Grantham explained in a paper published on Monday. Both bitcoin and Wall Street\u2019s tech-heavy Nasdaq index bottomed out in December 2022.\u201cEvery technological revolution like this [AI] \u2013 going back from the internet to telephones, railroads, or canals \u2013 has been accompanied by early massive hype and a stock market bubble as investors focus on the ultimate possibilities of the technology, pricing most of the very long-term potential immediately into current market prices,\u201d Grantham noted, calling AI a bubble.\u201cAnd many such revolutions are, in the end, often as transformative as those early investors could see and sometimes even more so \u2013 but only after a substantial period of disappointment during which the initial bubble bursts,\u201d Grantham added.Meanwhile, strategists at Citi said AI is the bubble but could last into 2025, according to Investing.com.BitcoinMarketsNvidiaNVDAOmkar GodboleOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor on CoinDesk's Markets team based in Mumbai, holds a masters degree in Finance and a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) member.

Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool   March 4, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          MSFT          GOOG            When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- garner the most attention from Wall Street. Each of these companies is playing a major role in rapid changes across e-commerce, cloud computing, consumer electronics, robotics, advertising, and more. But among the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia may be playing the most important role. The company's graphics processing units (GPU) are fueling applications across the generative AI spectrum -- from machine learning and quantum computing to data centers.  During its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point.\" With Nvidia stock up over 230% in the last year, some investors may be wondering what Huang meant, and if it's too late to buy shares. Let's dig into Nvidia's earnings report and assess the secular trends fueling demand for generative AI GPUs. While Nvidia stock is certainly enjoying the moment, investors may still come away inspired to buy shares now. Nvidia's business is soaring Oftentimes when a company is experiencing unprecedented demand, it will see soaring revenue -- and that's it. In other words, companies sometimes have to reinvest heavily into manufacturing in order to meet that higher demand. This can put a strain on operating margins and profits, even during times of accelerated sales growth. But Nvidia is a rare breed, make no mistake about it.   NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.   The chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, net income, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last 10 years. Just look at how steep the slope of each line has become. Not only is the company generating robust top-line growth, but its profits and cash flows are growing in lockstep. Taking this a step further, Nvidia is not resting on its laurels. While demand for its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs remains strong, the company is investing its profits relentlessly into product innovation. The company is on track to begin shipments of next-generation chips, including the H200 in the second quarter. Moreover, reports suggest that Nvidia plans to release its most powerful chip to date, the B100, later in 2024. The above trends underscore the fact that Nvidia's chips are in high demand. And with newer, improved models expected to reach customers soon, Nvidia's ride could just be getting started.   Image Source: Getty Images   The AI revolution is just getting started As use cases for AI continue to evolve, so do estimates about the total market size for the technology. A top Nvidia manager recently forecast that the market for AI-powered chips and software would grow to be worth $600 billion. The jury is still out on whether that prediction will prove accurate. However, what analysts are calling for in terms of growth can shed some light on Nvidia's potential.   Story Continues   NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.  While Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue of $61 billion is impressive, perhaps even more encouraging are its long-term growth prospects as estimated by Wall Street analysts. Given Nvidia's status as a market leader in AI GPUs, many clearly believe that the current demand trends can be sustained over the next few years.Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock?To me, the biggest risk associated with Nvidia is not its valuation. Rather, I think the competitive landscape is going to become increasingly intense. Nvidia's top rival at the moment is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). However, both Amazon and Microsoft are already developing their own inference and training chips for generative AI models. While Nvidia may have a head start, investors should not turn their backs on its big tech cohorts. While I suspect it'll take a few years for other chips to acquire meaningful market share, Nvidia investors should be considering what other growth drivers the company has beyond AI GPUs.One area that investors may be overlooking at the moment is Nvidia's opportunity in software. While the company is still primarily a hardware developer, Nvidia's software and services business reached a $1 billion revenue run rate during the fourth quarter.This is a big deal for a couple of reasons. First, software tends to come with high margins. Should Nvidia begin to eventually lose share in the chip market, it's likely that its margins will take a hit. However, this could be more than offset if Nvidia continues to see success in software. Additionally, since software services are typically more predictable in terms of demand, I wouldn't be surprised to see investors apply even more of a premium to Nvidia stock in the future.At a price-to-sales ratio of 32, Nvidia stock is trading much higher than its historical levels. However, the company's soaring revenue and profits, coupled with its steadfast reinvestment into new products and its budding software business, could warrant the premium. Given its differentiated business model, full-spectrum platform, and the secular tailwinds fueling AI, I think now is as good a time as ever to scoop up shares of Nvidia and hold them for the long run.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

It's arguably the single most important stock behind the artificial intelligence trend currently fueling the market.\nAs Nvidia has climbed higher and the broad market also reaches new all-time highs, skeptics have sounded the alarm for a stock market bubble. And while the market is stretched thinner than in years past, there's still reason to believe Nvidia is not necessarily overvalued, despite its 439% gain since the beginning of 2023.\nRed hot growth\nSay what you want about Nvidia stock's epic rise, but the company is delivering on every measure with a one-two punch of high revenue growth and expanding margins.\n\nData by YCharts.\nRevenue has more than tripled in the last year, while net income is up over 500%. That level of growth for a company as big as Nvidia is incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn understandable valuation\nThe past year of gains has also pushed Nvidia to trade with a 66.2 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a steep premium to even its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. However, the average analyst estimate for Nvidia's fiscal 2025 earnings per share is $23.92, roughly double last year's result.\nThe surge in anticipated profits gives Nvidia a much more reasonable forward P/E ratio. In fact, Nvidia has a lower forward-looking valuation than Tesla, Amazon, and Microsoft.\n\nData by YCharts.\nYou would be hard-pressed to find a growth stock that has nearly quadrupled in the last year with that low of a forward P/E ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitfalls of cyclical stocks\nAt the same time, there are a few reasons why focusing only on forward P/E is dangerous for a company like Nvidia. First, Nvidia still has to double its profits in the current fiscal year -- a high bar for any company, let alone one this size. The even more significant risk to consider is that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\nTypically, cyclical stocks have low P/E ratios during an expansion and high P/E ratios during a downturn. The idea is that investors won't pay too high of a price during times of elevated earnings but also won't sell off a stock just because there's a contraction in the cycle. Over time, the median P/E ratio works itself out to something more reasonable.\nA good example is agriculture and construction giant Deere. The company's earnings are slowing as the current expansion period nears an end. However, Deere's P/E ratio is just 10.6 because its trailing earnings are high, but investor sentiment is negative (shares are down 14% in the past year). Its 10-year median P/E ratio is a much higher 17.1 -- which makes sense -- the long-term median should be higher than Deere's current valuation. But in a downturn, investors can expect Deere's P/E to climb higher than that long-term baseline.\nThe opposite is happening with Nvidia. Its 66.1 P/E is higher than its 46.7 10-year median. But again, you could argue Nvidia deserves a much higher valuation given its scorching hot growth rate and earnings outlook for this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story is getting better, but it's still a story\nNvidia is exciting because it's growing quickly, and it's already such a valuable company that it can drive the whole market. Nvidia has already become a bit of a story stock, a company valued based more on its hype and potential than its fundamentals. But Nvidia isn't priced for perfection, either -- its 32.1 forward P/E ratio is reasonable, especially relative to the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. After all, Nvidia has almost always carried a premium, and there's no reason that should change in this part of its growth journey.\nPersonally, I'd prefer to buy Nvidia when the expectations are lower, and there's more margin for error. Nvidia's short-term performance could take a turn for the worse due to macroeconomic conditions and factors outside its control. And with the stock sitting at its peak, there's a heavy expectation its growth will march on uninterrupted. A forward P/E ratio above 30 is acceptable for a company likely to double its earnings this year, but that will change quickly if the company fails to deliver.\nProspective investors should be cautious about those expectations, as well as the behavior patterns of cyclical stocks. The easy money has already been made, and with Nvidia's market cap reaching $2 trillion, expecting the stock to again triple in the near term isn't realistic.\nAs an individual investor considering Nvidia for your portfolio, it's up to you to decide what kind of price you're willing to pay for the stock and what you expect from the business at that price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Tech giants continue to invest billions in this technology, nations are stockpiling the essential chips for AI ambitions, and the discussions on the promises and challenges of generative AI persistently fuel debates in boardrooms and dining rooms worldwide.\nWith the buzz surrounding AI unlikely to fade away anytime soon, this article asses the fundamentals of two leading giants, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), which have fortified their foothold in the dynamic landscape of AI through relentless innovations.\nThe integration of AI is steadily gaining traction across diverse industries and sectors. Businesses are increasingly recognizing the significant potential of AI in driving innovation and improving efficiency, leading to a noticeable increase in the demand for AI-powered solutions.\nAccording to Statista, the global market of AI is projected to reach a remarkable $305.90 billion this year and further escalate to a staggering $738.80 billion by 2030, growing at a 15.8% CAGR from 2024 to 2030\n\n\nMeanwhile, Cognizant predicts a seismic shift in the U.S. economy, suggesting that generative AI technology has the potential to elevate U.S. productivity by 1.7% to 3.5% and expand GDP by an estimated annual value ranging somewhere between $477 billion and $1 trillion over the next decade.\nIn an effort to harness the vast potential of AI and bolster the United States\u2019 leadership in AI innovation, various initiatives have been undertaken by the Biden -Harris administration.\nThese include the launch of the National AI Research Resource pilot program, aimed at fostering widespread innovation, competition, and equitable access to AI research. Additionally, an AI Talent Surge has been initiated to expedite the hiring of AI professionals within the federal government, with a special emphasis on data scientists.\nAs the AI revolution continues to reshape industries and economies, MSFT and NVDA have emerged as two of the biggest winners, buoyed by their significant contributions and innovations in the AI space. However, with both the stocks trading at extremely high valuation compared to the industry norms, investors could closely watch these stocks for a more opportune entry point.\n2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOKKeeping all these factors in mind, let\u2019s now delve deeper into the fundamentals of the aforementioned stocks for a better perspective.\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT)\nCommanding a market cap of over $3 trillion, software giant MSFT barely requires an introduction.

Will Healy, The Motley Fool   March 12, 2024 4 min read        4   In This Article:  NVDA          ^DJI          INTC          SPGI            Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock looks unstoppable. Amid the company's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI)-ready chips and the insatiable demand for the technology, its stock has risen by close to 300% over the last 12 months. With the stock approaching $1,000 per share, investors may wonder whether a stock split is imminent. Despite the fact that such a move will not directly influence Nvidia's valuation, investors should expect one soon. Here's why. Nvidia and stock splits The history of Nvidia stock is arguably the most compelling reason for expecting a near-term split. The company has split its stock five times since 2000, one of which has occurred since AI and data centers renewed investor interest in GPUs. That previous split occurred on July 19, 2021, when Nvidia carried out a 4-for-1 stock split. Interestingly, it closed at a pre-split price of around $744 per share that day, a level lower than today's current price. Still, investors should remember that these gains came quickly, as Nvidia stock is up about 85% this year and nearly 30% over the last month alone, indicating that a need for a split could have caught the company's board off guard. The big question surrounding the split Moreover, the most significant question surrounding a split is likely where the company will set the split ratio. The most recent 4-for-1 split was the largest ratio in the company's history, with the company having approved three 2-for-1 splits and one 3-for-2 split in the 2000s. However, as mentioned before, the more recent growth has probably exceeded expectations. While future growth may not match the 126% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), analysts forecast 81% revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and 22% the next fiscal year, indicating the massive profit increases should continue for the foreseeable future.  That could possibly mean the stock price is not done rising. Conversely, slowing growth could soon dampen enthusiasm for the stock, and the company's board will have to consider the massive drops in the stock price in past years. Hence, the company has to be ready for any potential price movement when it decides the split ratio.   NVDA data by YCharts  Another possible consideration Investors may want also to consider another possible factor -- inclusion as one of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P Dow Jones Indices, operated by S&P Global, has not telegraphed any intention to add Nvidia to the Dow 30. Also, the index already includes two semiconductor stocks, Apple and Intel.   Story Continues However, Intel has struggled in recent years, increasing the chances of its removal. Also, AI's influence over the economy could lead to more tech stocks in the index, and Nvidia's $2.2 trillion market cap makes it a likely choice.Furthermore, the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index. Since the nominal share price determines a stock's weighting on the Dow, companies have often initiated stock splits to reduce their influence over the index. Should Nvidia seek a place on the Dow 30, it may alter the split ratio to increase its chances of inclusion.Making sense of a potential stock splitGiven the company's history of stock splits, investors should expect such a move sooner rather than later. Also, since the previous split occurred less than three years ago at a lower price, the split ratio is likely the most significant question surrounding such a move.Indeed, Nvidia's board will need to consider the stock's price history in deciding the ratio, both in a positive and negative sense. Also, assuming Nvidia seeks to become a Dow 30 stock, it will have to become more sensitive to its nominal share price.Ultimately, the stock split changes nothing for Nvidia on the surface. However, given the company's history, shareholders should anticipate a split and, possibly, increased interest in the stock from some unexpected parties.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated several such robots completing a variety of tasks.\nBuilt for Humanoid Robots\r\nJetson Thor was created as a new computing platform capable of performing complex tasks and interacting safely and naturally with people and machines. It has a modular architecture optimized for performance, power and size.\nThe SoC includes a next-generation GPU based on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with a transformer engine delivering 800 teraflops of 8-bit floating point AI performance to run multimodal generative AI models like GR00T. With an integrated functional safety processor, a high-performance CPU cluster and 100Gb of Ethernet bandwidth, it significantly simplifies design and integration efforts.\nNVIDIA is building a comprehensive AI platform for leading humanoid robot companies such as 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Fourier Intelligence, Sanctuary AI, Unitree Robotics and XPENG Robotics, among others.\n\u201cWe are at an inflection point in history, with human-centric robots like Digit poised to change labor forever. Modern AI will accelerate development, paving the way for robots like Digit to help people in all aspects of daily life,\u201d said Jonathan Hurst, cofounder and chief robot officer at Agility Robotics. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with NVIDIA to invest in the computing, simulation tools, machine learning environments and other necessary infrastructure to enable the dream of robots being a part of daily life.\u201d\n\u201cEmbodied AI will not only help address some of humanity\u2019s biggest challenges, but also create innovations which are currently beyond our reach or imagination,\u201d said Geordie Rose, cofounder and CEO of Sanctuary AI. \u201cTechnology this important shouldn\u2019t be built in silos, which is why we prioritize long-term partners like NVIDIA.\u201d\nMajor Updates to Isaac Platform\r\nThe Isaac tools that GR00T utilizes are capable of creating new foundation models for any robot embodiment in any environment. Among these tools are Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning, and OSMO, a compute orchestration service.\nEmbodied AI models require massive amounts of real and synthetic data. The new Isaac Lab is a GPU-accelerated, lightweight, performance-optimized application built on Isaac Sim specifically for running thousands of parallel simulations for robot learning.\nTo scale robot development workloads across heterogeneous compute, OSMO coordinates the data generation, model training and software/hardware-in-the-loop workflows across distributed environments.\nNVIDIA also announced Isaac Manipulator and Isaac Perceptor \u2014 a collection of robotics pretrained models, libraries and reference hardware.\nIsaac Manipulator offers state-of-the-art dexterity and modular AI capabilities for robotic arms, with a robust collection of foundation models and GPU-accelerated libraries. It provides up to an 80x speedup in path planning and zero-shot perception increases efficiency and throughput, enabling developers to automate a greater number of new robotic tasks. Among early ecosystem partners are Yaskawa, Universal Robots, a Teradyne company, PickNik Robotics, Solomon, READY Robotics and Franka Robotics.\nIsaac Perceptor provides multi-camera, 3D surround-vision capabilities, which are increasingly being used in autonomous mobile robots adopted in manufacturing and fulfillment operations to improve efficiency and worker safety as well as reduce error rates and costs. Early adopters include ArcBest, BYD and KION Group as they aim to achieve new levels of autonomy in material handling operations and more.\nThe new Isaac platform capabilities are expected to be available in the next quarter.

Given recent challenges for Musk's company and lagging shares price performance, retail investors have continued shifting their purchases progressively in favor of NVDA lately,\" Vanda Research said.\n\n\nThe dethroning is significant as Tesla has been a darling among retail investors throughout all of 2023, with investors purchasing upwards of $4 billion of the stock over a two-week period in early 2023.\u00a0\nThe swap between Nvidia and Tesla means the AI chipmaker is now an indicator of overall sentiment among retail traders, according to the note.\n\"NVDA looks every day more like the new bellwether of general retail sentiment,\" Vanda Research said. But the stock could still have a long way to go in winning over retail investors, as some may be hesitant to buy a stock that is sitting at all-time highs.\n\n\n\"The 'scary' part is that despite the recent hype around anything AI and semiconductors, current retail flows into NVDA shares have merely matched the lowest point seen in TSLA stocks during 2023,\" Vanda Research said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Vanda Research\n                        \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesla\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nTrading\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Renowned for its semiconductor innovations, NVDA\u2019s chips are serving as the cornerstone of the AI landscape. Through strategic partnerships and collaborations, the company is fortifying its market leadership, consistently pushing the boundaries of technological advancement.\nOn March 7, NVDA\u2019s partnership with HP Inc. (HPQ) to integrate NVIDIA CUDA-X\u2122 data processing libraries with HPQ AI workstation solutions signifies a significant advancement for the company. The collaboration is expected to enhance NVDA\u2019s position in the AI development landscape by providing accelerated data preparation and processing capabilities, strengthening its offerings and appealing to developers seeking efficient solutions.\nFurthermore, the unveiling of StarCoder2 on February 28, in collaboration with ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) and Hugging Face, highlights NVDA\u2019s commitment to innovation.\nThese unique alliances and groundbreaking advancements further validate NVDA\u2019s competitive advantage on the technological front and open up new areas of business expansion into the future. As the company is enabling more rapid AI model development for wide-ranging applications, this further extends its competitive edge in the fast-crescent AI global marketplace that foretells sustained growth and further innovation.\n\n\nNVDA shares have gained 18.8% and 92.9% over the past month and six months, closing the last trading session at $879.44.\nHere are the financial aspects of NVDA that could influence its price performance in the near term:\nMixed Financials\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on January 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s non-GAAP revenue increased 265.3% year-over-year to $22.10 billion. Its non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS came in at $12.84 billion and $5.16 per share, up 490.6% and 486.4% from the prior year\u2019s period, respectively.\n2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOKHowever, as of January 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s total\u00a0current liabilities\u00a0amounted to $10.63 billion, up from $6.56 billion as of January 29, 2023.\nRobust Historical Growth\nOver the past three years, NVDA\u2019s revenue and EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 54% and 81%, respectively. Its net income and EPS grew at respective CAGRs of 90.1% and 90.3% during the period. Moreover, the company\u2019s levered free cash flow rose at a CAGR of 74.6% over the same time frame.\nOptimistic Analyst Estimates \n\n\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $110.57 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2025 reflects an 81.5% year-over-year increase. Similarly, the company\u2019s EPS for the current year is expected to grow 90.3% from the previous year to $24.66. Moreover, the company topped the consensus revenue and EPS estimates in all four trailing quarters.\nSound Profitability\nThe stock\u2019s trailing-12-month gross profit margin and trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 72.72% and 56.60% are 49.1% and 515.3% higher than the industry averages of 48.76% and 9.20%, respectively. In addition, the company\u2019s trailing-12-month levered FCF margin of 32.61% is 261.5% higher than the 9.02% industry average.\nStretched Valuation\nIn terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, NVDA is trading at 36.85x, 48.2% higher than the industry average of 24.87x.

However, its Value rating receives a less favorable D grade, mainly due to its lofty valuation.\nIn terms of Stability, NVDA encounters hurdles, evident in its F grade. This is emphasized by the stock\u2019s 24-month beta of 1.95, indicating higher volatility.\nNVDA is ranked #22 out of 90 within the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry.\u00a0Click here\u00a0to access NVDA\u2019s Momentum, Sentiment and Quality ratings.\nBottom Line\nNVDA has the potential to establish itself as a leader in artificial intelligence and propel long-term dominance and growth through groundbreaking semiconductor advancements.

This rise in demand can be attributed to rapid technological breakthroughs, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things.\nAI chip major NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) is popular for its advanced chips that power AI, but its expensive valuation, growing competition, and strict regulations are lowering its appeal amongst investors. Therefore, investors could consider buying fundamentally strong chip stocks SMART Global Holdings, Inc. (SGH), Nikon Corporation (NINOY), and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) instead of NVDA.\nBefore diving deeper into the fundamentals of these stocks, let\u2019s discuss what\u2019s shaping the chip industry\u2019s prospects and why this is not the right time to buy NVDA.\nSemiconductors have become critical in today\u2019s tech-driven world, helping enhance the performance and functionality of electronic devices. Chips power a variety of applications in sectors, including consumer electronics, healthcare, automobiles, and manufacturing.\n\n\nIDC predicts a resurgence of the chip industry in 2024, driven by rebounding smartphone demand and rising demand for AI chips. The semiconductor market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of more than 20%.\nThe global semiconductor market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 8.8% to reach $1.31 trillion by 2032. Investors\u2019 interest in semiconductor stocks is evident from the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF\u2019s (XSD) 18.6% returns over the past year.\nThe global graphics processing unit (GPU) market is predicted to grow due to rising demand for high-performance computing, IoT trends, and sophisticated technologies such as AR, VR, and AI. The global GPU market is predicted to reach $110.6 billion by 2030, growing at a 22.5% CAGR.\nGenerative AI has been the primary driver for the outperformance of tech stocks since last year. Advanced GPUs are required to train generative AI programs. These advanced chips can use and process massive amounts of data needed to train generative AI programs rapidly and efficiently.\n2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOKWith the massive demand for generative AI, corporations are investing extensively in advanced chips. Deloitte has predicted that the market for specialized chips to power generative AI will be over $50 billion this year.\nNVDA dominates the AI market with its advanced GPUs, controlling about 80% of the high-end AI chips. The company recently surpassed the $2 trillion market capitalization, becoming the third most valuable company in the United States. Demand for its H100 and A100 chips has skyrocketed.\nHowever, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) has been gaining ground with its Radeon Instinct line of GPUs, offering competitive performance at a lower price point. Additionally, Intel Corporation (INTC) has also entered the AI market with its Nervana Neural Network Processors, providing more options for consumers and potentially disrupting Nvidia\u2019s dominance.\nMoreover, its customers, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet, are now developing their own custom chips for their needs. Moreover, export restrictions to China have hit NVDA\u2019s China revenues, dropping 53% sequentially during the fourth quarter.\n\n\nNVDA ended the year strongly by reporting that in its non-GAAP revenue in the fourth quarter rose 265.3% year-over-year to $22.10 billion. Its non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS came in at $12.84 billion and $5.16 per share, up 490.6% and 486.4% from the prior year\u2019s period, respectively.\nHowever, the stock is trading at a significant premium valuation, which its financials may fail to justify. Its forward EV/Sales of 20.32x is 595.1% higher than the 2.92x industry average. Also, its forward Price/Sales of 20.46x is 596.8% higher than the industry average of 2.94x. Moreover, the stock\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA of 32.03x is 108.8% higher than the industry average of 15.34x.\nConsidering these factors, let\u2019s analyze the fundamentals of the three Semiconductor & Wireless Chip picks that are better than NVDA, beginning with the third choice.\nStock #3: SMART Global Holdings, Inc. (SGH)\nSGH is a memory-focused company that engages in the designing and development of enterprise solutions in the United States, China, Europe, and internationally. It operates through Memory Solutions, Intelligent Platform Solutions, and LED Solutions segments.\nSGH\u2019s trailing-12-month Return on Total Capital of 3.89% is 58.6% higher than the industry average of 2.46%. Its 20.98% trailing-12-month leverage FCF margin is 132.4% higher than the 9.03% industry average. Also, its 2.73% trailing-12-month CAPEX/Sales is 18% higher than the 2.31% industry average.\nDuring the first quarter, which ended on December 1, 2023, SGH\u2019s total net sales came in at $274.25 million. The company\u2019s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $91.28 million, and its operating income stood at $26.68 million.\nIn addition, its non-GAAP net income attributable to SGH came in at $12.54 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.24.\nStreet expects SGH\u2019s EPS and revenue for fiscal 2025 to increase 78.5% and 24.7% year-over-year to $2.09 and $1.51 billion, respectively. It surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. Over the past year, the stock has gained 50.1% to close the last trading session at $23.44.\nSGH\u2019s POWR Ratings reflect this promising outlook. It has an overall rating of B, equating to a Buy in our proprietary rating system. The POWR Ratings assess stocks by 118 different factors, each with its own weighting.\nSGH has an A grade for Momentum and a B for Value and Sentiment. Within the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry, it is ranked #16 out of 90 stocks.

It operates through the Imaging Products Business, Precision Equipment Business, Healthcare Business, Components Business, Industrial equipment, and other segments.\nOn March 7, 2024, NINOY announced that it has agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding membership interests of RED.com, LLC (RED), resulting in RED becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nikon.\nThis agreement was the result of Nikon and RED\u2019s shared desire to combine their strengths in order to meet the needs of their customers and deliver outstanding user experiences that go above and beyond their expectations.\nNINOY\u2019s trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 43.26% is 20.8% higher than the 35.80% industry average. Its trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 10.91% is 1.2% higher than the 10.78% industry average. Additionally, its 4.26% trailing-12-month CAPEX/Sales is 40.2% higher than the 3.04% industry average.\n\n\nNINOY\u2019s revenue for the nine months that ended December 31, 2023, increased 16% year-over-year to \u00a5528.91 billion ($3.57 billion). Its gross profit rose 6.5% over the prior-year quarter to \u00a5229.94 billion ($1.55 billion). Also, the company\u2019s profit for the period and EPS came in at \u00a524.52 billion ($165.69 million) and \u00a571.72, respectively.\nFor the quarter ending June 30, 2024, NINOY\u2019s revenue is expected to increase 1.3% year-over-year to $1.12 billion. Over the past three months, the stock has gained 11.8% to close the last trading session at $10.55.\nNINOY\u2019s strong fundamentals are reflected in its POWR Ratings. It has an overall rating of B, which equates to a Buy in our proprietary rating system.\nIt is ranked #11 in the same industry. It has an A grade for Momentum and a B for Value and Stability. Click here to see the additional ratings of NINIOY for Growth, Sentiment, and Quality.\n\n\nStock #1: QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM)\nQCOM develops and commercializes foundational technologies for the wireless industry worldwide. It operates through three segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL), and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI).\nQCOM\u2019s trailing-12-month EBIT margin of 24.81% is 421.6% higher than the industry average of 4.76%. Its 37.63% trailing-12-month Return on Common Equity is significantly higher than the 3.12% industry average. Additionally, its 21.39% trailing-12-month net income margin is 728.2% higher than the 2.58% industry average.\nFor the fiscal first quarter that ended on December 24, 2023, QCOM\u2019s total revenues amounted to $9.94 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Its operating income increased 18.8% year-over-year to $2.93 billion.\n\n\nThe company\u2019s net income and EPS rose 23.7% and 24.2% year-over-year to $2.77 billion and $2.46, respectively.\nAnalysts expect QCOM\u2019s EPS and revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, to increase 7.2% and 0.4% year-over-year to $2.30 and $9.31 billion, respectively. It surpassed the consensus EPS estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. QCOM shares have gained 55.6% over the past six months, closing the last trading session at $173.08.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that QCOM has an overall B rating, equating to a Buy in our POWR Ratings system.\nIt has a B grade for Momentum, Sentiment and Quality.

According to the estimates of 60 analysts covering Nvidia, the stock's median one-year price target is $970. That's close to its current stock price of $962. However, it is worth noting that 88% of the analysts covering Nvidia still rate the stock as a buy.\nWhat's more, its Street-high price target of $1,400 points toward a 45% jump from current levels over the next 12 months or so. But could this high-flying AI stock really sustain its rally and hit that level in the coming year?\n\nNvidia's AI dominance could help maintain its stunning growth\nNvidia is just coming off a phenomenal fiscal 2024 during which its revenue increased 126% to $60.9 billion and adjusted earnings went up a whopping 288% to $12.96 per share. Its flagship H100 AI GPU (graphics processing unit) played a major role in helping it deliver this outstanding growth.\nThe waiting periods for buyers to obtain the H100 were as long as eight to 11 months at one point last year. However, the company's aggressive focus on boosting chip supply allowed it to eventually bring the waiting period down to three to four months. With robust demand for the H100 and limited supplies of rival options, Nvidia controls a whopping 98% of the data center GPU market, according to a report by Wells Fargo analysts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semiconductor bellwether is now looking to take things up a notch with newly announced AI GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture. These chips will be available later in 2024, and Nvidia is promising massive performance gains at significantly lower power consumption levels.\nMore specifically, Nvidia says that its Blackwell chips will allow customers \"to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\" The company is expecting major cloud computing providers to adopt these chips, and is confident that the Blackwell platform will help it grab a bigger share of the data center GPU market, which it estimates is worth $250 billion.\nSo even though Nvidia's data center revenue rose by a massive 217% to $47.5 billion in its recently ended fiscal 2024, it still has a lot of room to grow in this space. Some analysts estimate that Nvidia could generate a whopping $300 billion in annual revenue from sales of AI chips alone by 2027.\nA new and more powerful chip will allow customers to train even bigger large language models (LLMs) and help deliver real-time generative AI applications while consuming significantly less electricity. What's more, the price of a single B200 Blackwell chip will be in the range of $30,000 to $40,000, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. That would be in line with the price of the current H100 processor, suggesting that Nvidia is focused on maintaining its share of this lucrative market with competitive pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this explains why Wall Street firms have been raising their price targets on Nvidia stock. Goldman Sachs has raised its Nvidia price target to $1,000 from $875, and Bernstein's is similar. Wells Fargo now has a $970 price target on Nvidia, up from $840 previously.\nHow much upside can the stock deliver in the coming year?\nNvidia's latest product announcement has led analysts to boost their expectations for the company.\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nNvidia delivered $60.9 billion in revenue in the previous fiscal year. The chart above indicates that analysts believe its top line is on track to increase by more than 2.5 times in the space of just three years. And they've increased their earnings growth expectations as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nIf Nvidia can hit almost $25 per share in earnings in its fiscal 2025, which has just begun, its bottom line will nearly double from fiscal 2024's $12.96 per share. Nvidia is currently trading at 75 times earnings. While that's higher than its five-year average multiple of 64, Nvidia's outstanding growth justifies that valuation.\nAssuming that a year from now, Nvidia is trading at a relatively discounted 50 times earnings, and has hit $25 per share in earnings, its stock price would be $1,250 -- a 33% increase from current levels. That would exceed the Street-high price target. However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia delivering even bigger gains, as the market could reward it with a higher earnings multiple thanks to the terrific growth it has been delivering.\n\n\n\nWells Fargo is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Cathie Wood, head of Ark Investment Management, sold NVDA stock in 2023 and never looked back. Critics of Wood, of which there are many, will see this as more ammunition for their critiques of her investment style. Detractors point most commonly to her Ark funds' heavy concentration in highly volatile disruptive technology stocks, the lofty valuations of many top picks, and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 underwhelming short-term performance. But could this be a tortoise and hare situation where Wood will, over time, enjoy the last laugh? Wood hasn't abandoned artificial intelligence stocks. She's just taking a different path. Whether or not she succeeds will depend on one stock that her funds have been buying hand over fist, that of UiPath Inc. PATH. A Path to Future Riches?\u00a0Wood started buying PATH stock in April 2022, which coincided with the company going public. She has continued to hold or add to her position to this day. Today, UiPath is the second largest holding by share count in her signature Ark Innovation ETF ARKK. At the time of her first purchase, Wood expressed \"high conviction in UiPath's ability to integrate Robotic Process Automation (RPA) into many business processes across large enterprises around the world.\" To that end, UiPath has customers in several sectors, including healthcare, banking and financial services, insurance, government, telecom, and manufacturing. The company's mantra is \"UiPath is AI at work.\" Its AI software bots can help enterprise customers move from discovery to fully automated operations. Since the first quarter of its 2022 fiscal year, UiPath has grown its annualized renewal run rate (ARR) at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% through its most recent quarter ending in September 2023. It's the Egg to the Chicken\u00a0The growth of Nvidia reminds investors that the AI story is still in its early stages. That's why investors continue to rush into Nvidia. AI chips will be essential to enabling AI applications. But no chip can make an application happen with software. Perhaps that's the bet that Wood is taking on UiPath. The question is, should you? PATH stock is down more than 66% since its initial public offering (IPO). However, the stock is up 52% in the last 12 months, but the UiPath analyst ratings on MarketBeat have a Hold rating on the stock with a $22.32 consensus price target that is 6% below the price on March 4,\u00a02024. Looking at the option chain for PATH stock, $23.50 seems to be a sweet spot for short-term call and put options. Going out until mid-April, traders anticipate that the stock will be range-bound around its current level. One catalyst could be the company's next earnings report on March 13,\u00a02024. The company is forecasting revenue of $381 million. That's slightly below the consensus estimate of $382.84 million.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? When Is Debt Dangerous? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  How Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry? You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, it does have US$26.0b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$16.3b.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Debt to Equity History March 1st 2024   How Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet? According to the last reported balance sheet, NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.  This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.95t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load! Better yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.   Story Continues But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, NVIDIA generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Summing UpWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with NVIDIA .At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

(Photo illustration by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) has experienced a remarkable run-up in its stock price. \u200b\n\nTo say the stock has been on a roll would be an understatement. Nvidia has gained 550% since the start of last year, added $2 trillion in market value over the past 15 months, and is responsible for about 29% of the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date gains.\n\n\nAfter such a historic run, it\u2019s natural to wonder if the stock is ahead of itself. The bear case is tough to make, though, because Nvidia isn\u2019t just another meme stock run wild. It\u2019s a real company with powerful fundamental tailwinds. Revenue doubled in the last fiscal year and is projected to rise another 81% this year. Revenue growth like that for such a large company is extremely rare.\n\nNvidia also has an exciting story that easily captures the imagination of investors. The world\u2019s most valuable semiconductor company is at the center of a corporate arms race to boost computing power for AI workloads. The biggest companies in Silicon Valley are virtually tripping over each other to buy Nvidia\u2019s most coveted chips.\n\n\nEver since ChatGPT debuted to the broad public, it\u2019s been widely assumed that AI will be a very big market. But nobody knows precisely how big the market will become, or what Nvidia\u2019s long-term market share will be. This allows investors to project whatever stratospheric growth rate assumptions they wish, and explains why the shares trade at a nosebleed valuation multiple of 37 times sales.\nIf you\u2019re a long-term shareholder of Nvidia, congratulations\u2014it\u2019s been a wonderful ride. But how long can the vertical ascent continue?\nIn the Pixar movie Toy Story, there\u2019s a quirky character named Buzz Lightyear. He exudes boundless enthusiasm for space exploration, frequently boasting that he can travel \u201cto infinity and beyond.\u201d\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nYet, Buzz never really goes to infinity and beyond. That\u2019s just a story in his head. A figment of his imagination. In reality, he was a toy stricken with a case of ebullient delusion.\nNvidia bulls aren\u2019t as delusional as Buzz. But they may be too giddy for their own good. No stock goes up to infinity, and neither will Nvidia.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is notoriously volatile and prone to boom and bust cycles. \u200bChipmakers have struggled at times to meet short-term swings in demand with long-term levels of production capacity, which can cause periods of oversupply and shortages.\n\n\nCurrently, the industry is in a boom period. But it\u2019s unclear how long the current demand wave will last. Any slowdown in buying by major data center owners such as Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet could dent Nvidia's revenue and growth estimates.\nNvidia, whose name is partly inspired by the Latin word for envy, is currently the most envied company on the planet. Success breeds competition. Numerous companies are now rushing to get a bigger piece of the AI chip market. For instance, Advanced Micro Devices launched its AI-accelerator last year and is forecasting significant revenue growth. \u200bIntel Corp. also has its own AI chips it will attempt to push into the marketplace.\nAccording to Reuters, tech giants including Intel, Qualcomm and Google have formed a consortium named the UXL Foundation to \"build a suite of software and tools that will be able to power multiple types of AI accelerator chips.\"\nNvidia may also face competition from companies that don\u2019t even exist yet. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, was seeking to raise trillions of dollars to significantly expand the world\u2019s supply of semiconductor chips.\nAnother risk is that macro market conditions change. That\u2019s because the factors that have been driving Nvidia\u2019s manic price action stretch beyond just the company itself.\nWe have been in an era of excess liquidity ever since the Federal Reserve decided to massively expand its balance sheet in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. And we also live in an era where passive investing has become a lot more popular, which favors stocks with the strongest momentum. When abundant liquidity mixes with the valuation agnostic investing approach used to construct passive portfolios, it\u2019s an easy environment to see dramatic valuation overshoots.\nA lesson from the Tech Bubble that burst in 2000 was that it usually doesn\u2019t pay to buy stocks that trade over 10 times sales. At 37 times sales, Nvidia is well beyond that valuation. For me at least, that statistic alone says buyer beware. I don\u2019t care how great Nvidia\u2019s chips are, or how revolutionary the AI theme may be. I just don\u2019t invest in stocks at that high of a valuation, because history shows it usually doesn\u2019t work out well. If anyone has a backtest that disproves that notion, I\u2019d love to see it.\nValuation matters a lot over the long run, but it has almost no signaling power in the short run. If Nvidia can trade at 37 times sales, it can just as easily trade at 107 times sales.\nHowever, even from a trading perspective there are some yellow lights beginning to flash.\nYear-to-date, the momentum factor has dramatically outperformed, which may leave it ripe for a correction. Global PMI surveys appear to be bottoming and commodities are breaking out to the upside. If inflation heats up again, it could easily cause a rotation out of high flying tech stocks into other areas of the market. Since Nvidia is the posterchild for momentum in this market, that could lead to an uncomfortable correction.\nA trend is only your friend until it ends. One toolkit that helps diagnose when trend reversals are more likely to occur is the DeMark Indicators. I\u2019ve written about these indicators before when I was attempting to sniff out a potential market bottom.\nThis week, Nvidia printed 13 exhaustion signals using DeMark\u2019s TD Sequential and TD Combo indicators. If I were long Nvidia, this would concern me, because the stock flipped to bearish trend right after the 13s, and the next clear line of support is way down at $615. Another bearish trading signal is that momentum waned over the last month as the stock was making new highs (see bottom panel below). Wall Street traders call this a negative divergence.\nNvidia is a great company, but that doesn\u2019t make it a great investment at any price. If you\u2019re long, this may be a good time to consider taking profits. And if you\u2019re considering buying shares for the first time, you may want to patiently wait for a better entry point.Source: Bloomberg, DeMark Analytics Silverlight Asset Management, LLC\nFollow me on\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

However, two under-the-radar, pure play AI stocks offer asymmetric reward-to-risk. In addition, these two up-and-comers have recently inked deals with AI juggernauts, offering a massive catalyst. Below are the two highest-impact AI partnerships:  BigBear.ai (BBAI) & Palantir (PLTR) BigBear.ai and Palantir both offer decision intelligence solutions spanning national security, digital identity, supply chains and logistics, enterprise operations, and integration of manned-unmanned teaming within autonomous systems. On February 28th, BBAI and PLTR announced a strategic partnership combining AI-powered products with a next-generation operating platform. The partnership is a big deal for BBAI for two reasons: 1.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BBAI has a market cap of just $600 million, while PLTR has a market cap of $54 billion. With PLTR as a partner, BBAI has an opportunity to throw gasoline on their growth. 2.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PLTR is the undisputed leader in this niche space. If PLTR finds value in BBAI\u2019s offering, it proves the quality of BBAI\u2019s product suite. Also, PLTR may look to acquire the company down the line, should it be necessary. Swing to Profitably Nvidia and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) have proven how much demand there is for the AI industry. However, few pure plays exist, and even fewer profitable ones. Last quarter, BBAI posted its first profitable quarter as a public company.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Wall Street is Bullish Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest healthy EPS growth of 64.21% in 20223.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research BBAI is also gaining momentum from an EPS expectations perspective. Last quarter, BBAI beat analysts\u2019 expectations by 142.86%. Accumulation Patterns On February 27, shares jumped 38% on volume 10x the norm! The news was not apparent, but such heavy volume and price momentum indicate massive accumulation. The stock also forms a bullish and potentially explosive high-tight flag pattern.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research SoundHound AI (SOUN) & Nvidia (NVDA) SOUN Overview SoundHound is a technology company that specializes in audio and voice recognition. One of its prominent products is the SoundHound app, which allows users to identify songs by listening to a snippet of music. Users can hum, sing, or type lyrics into the app, and it provides information about the song title, artist, and album. SOUN\u2019s technology extends beyond music identification, incorporating voice-enabled AI solutions for various applications, including voice-controlled virtual assistants and integration into smart devices.   Story Continues Why is the NVDA Investment Impactful?Until now, NVDA has been selling the \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d to the AI revolution. However, NVDA\u2019s first 13F filing shows the company stepped out of its wheelhouse to purchase nearly $4 million worth of SOUN, showing the company also has ambitions for AI pure plays. Also, now that NVDA has the third largest market cap in the U.S., the company has plenty of cash to add exposure to their investment down the line \u2013 likely to keep a bid under SOUN shares.  Zacks Investment Research  Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBullish EPS Surprise HistoryThough SOUN has only been public since early 2022, the company has exhibited a strong tendency to beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations. SOUN has bested Zacks EPS Estimates in six of its first eight quarters.

The recent Q4 beat was spectacular and drove NVDA to its all-time highs. Being at the helm of the AI revolution, my bullish stance on NVDA remains. I am confident in its long-term potential for growth, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and its relatively favorable valuation. Hence, I will buy the stock at current levels.    NVDA Posts Blowout Q4 Earnings Yet Again Now the third largest company in the world, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q4 result on February 21, driven by accelerated computing and generative AI momentum. Adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share\u00a0handily beat the analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.59 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+486%) than the Fiscal Q4-2023 (ended January 2023) figure of $0.88 per share.  Impressively, Q4 revenue jumped 265% year-over-year to $22.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $20.5 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 10.6 percentage points to 76.7% from 66.1% a year ago. Importantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, more than trebled year-over-year to $47.5 billion in Fiscal 2024. Q4 revenues for the segment also saw remarkable growth, increasing by 409% year-over-year to $18.4 billion. As expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that China represented only a mid-single-digit percentage of Data Center revenue in Q4 versus 20-25% on an average basis over the last few quarters. Looking ahead, the Q1 guidance appears promising, with revenues expected to hover around $24 billion. Adjusted gross margins are forecasted to be around 77%. Exuberating great optimism for the future, CEO Jensen Huang commented during the call, \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing\u2026 [and] a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.\u201d NVDA\u2019s Long-Term Trajectory Remains Impressive NVDA is Wall Street\u2019s favorite for a good reason. Over the last six years, Nvidia\u2019s revenues have skyrocketed by nearly 9x, from $6.91 billion in FY2017 to $60.9 billion in FY2024 (see below). What\u2019s even more applaudable is that its earnings have grown by 18x from $1.67 billion to $29.8 billion over the same period, thanks to its rising profit margins. This data instills in me a profound sense of confidence in NVDA\u2019s strong business fundamentals and its anticipated growth trajectory, driven by AI.   Story Continues   According to Wall Street estimates, NVDA is projected to achieve a net profit of $64.3 billion in Fiscal 2025, doubling from the $32.3 billion reported in the recently concluded Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, revenues are expected to surpass the monumental $100 billion milestone. These remarkable growth expectations provide compelling reasons to continue investing in this AI giant, especially considering that the growth narrative of disruptive generative AI is only just beginning.NVDA Could Likely Go for a Stock SplitInching closer to the $1,000 milestone price mark, many Wall Street analysts opine that a stock split could occur in the next year or so. NVDA underwent a 4:1 stock split in May 2021, when it was priced at approximately $600. This move facilitated easier access for smaller retail investors to purchase the stock. While a stock split doesn\u2019t inherently alter the company\u2019s valuation or fundamentals, it does broaden its investor base by attracting smaller investors.Other prominent companies that have opted for stock splits include EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (in 2020 and 2022) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Therefore, it is likely that NVDA may consider another stock split in the near future.NVDA Valuation Still Isn\u2019t Expensive, Given Its Earnings ProwessHaving overtaken Amazon by market capitalization and on the verge of eclipsing Apple\u2019s market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.On the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive at all. Currently, it\u2019s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 36.9x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, U.S.-based semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trading at a forward P/E of 53.4x.Furthermore, its current valuation reflects a discount from its five-year average of 46x. These are attractive discount levels and likely present a great buying opportunity, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan NVDA.Is NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?NVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 39 Buys and two Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $909.49 suggests that the shares will return 3.4% over the next year.  Interestingly, the average target price has been increasing incredibly as analysts strive to match NVDA\u2019s continuous record-breaking highs month after month. It has increased from $661 just three months ago to $909.Conclusion: Consider Buying NVDA for Its Long-Term AI PotentialNVDA stock is poised to soar to unprecedented heights, propelled by the extraordinary growth expectations within the AI space. As an industry frontrunner, NVDA maintains a substantial lead over its competitors, boasting an almost monopolistic position with an approximately 80% market share in AI chips. This dominant position ensures a robust moat and solidifies its grip on the flourishing AI landscape.The insatiable demand for all things AI far outpaces the available supply, underscoring the potential for accelerated computing and generative AI adoption across various industries and regions. This trend is anticipated to be a primary driver of revenue and earnings growth for NVDA in the years ahead.With NVDA\u2019s highly anticipated live GTC conference scheduled for March 18-21, my bullish outlook on the company remains steadfast, prompting me to purchase shares at their current levels.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

It consists of two racks, each containing 18 NVIDIA Grace CPUs and 36 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, connected by fourth-generation NVIDIA NVLink switches.\nOn the show floor, NVIDIA demoed this fully operational data center as a digital twin in NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for connecting and building generative AI-enabled 3D pipelines, tools, applications and services.\nTo bring up new data centers as fast as possible, NVIDIA first built its digital twin with software tools connected by Omniverse. Engineers unified and visualized multiple CAD datasets in full physical accuracy and photorealism in Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) using the Cadence Reality digital twin platform, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse APIs.\n\nDesign, Simulate and Optimize With Enhanced Efficiency and Accuracy\nThe new GB200 cluster is replacing an existing cluster in one of NVIDIA\u2019s legacy data centers. To start the digital build-out, technology company Kinetic Vision scanned the facility using the NavVis VLX wearable lidar scanner to produce highly accurate point cloud data and panorama photos.\nThen, Prevu3D software was used to remove the existing clusters and convert the point cloud to a 3D mesh. This provided a physically accurate 3D model of the facility, in which the new digital data center could be simulated.\nEngineers combined and visualized multiple CAD datasets with enhanced precision and realism by using the Cadence Reality platform. The platform\u2019s integration with Omniverse provided a powerful computing platform that enabled teams to develop OpenUSD-based 3D tools, workflows and applications.\nOmniverse Cloud APIs also added interoperability with more tools, including PATCH MANAGER and NVIDIA Air. With PATCH MANAGER, the team designed the physical layout of their cluster and networking infrastructure, ensuring that cabling lengths were accurate and routing was properly configured.\nThe team used Cadence\u2019s Reality Digital Twin solvers, accelerated by NVIDIA Modulus APIs and NVIDIA Grace Hopper, to simulate airflows, as well as the performance of the new liquid-cooling systems from partners like Vertiv and Schneider Electric. The integrated cooling systems in the GB200 trays were simulated and optimized using solutions from Ansys, which brought simulation data into the digital twin.\nThe demo showed how digital twins can allow users to fully test, optimize and validate data center designs before ever producing a physical system. By visualizing the performance of the data center in the digital twin, teams can better optimize their designs and plan for what-if scenarios.\nUsers can also enhance data center and cluster designs by balancing disparate sets of boundary conditions, such as cabling lengths, power, cooling and space, in an integrated manner \u2014 enabling engineers and design teams to bring clusters online much faster and with more efficiency and optimization than before.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Blackwell.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: 3D | Digital Twin | GTC 2024 | Omniverse | Universal Scene Description \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Trained on DNA sequences, the model can be used to predict the function of specific regions of the genome, analyze the effects of gene mutations and variants, and more.\nA second model coming soon to BioNeMo, scBERT, is trained on data from single-cell RNA sequencing, enabling users to apply it to downstream tasks such as predicting the effects of gene knockouts \u2014 where a specific gene is removed or deactivated \u2014 or identifying cell types such as neurons, blood cells or muscle cells.\nEquiDock, a third, joins a collection of BioNeMo models that can predict the 3D structure of how two proteins interact, which is critical to understanding if a drug molecule will be effective.\nAt Your Service: New Microservices Enable AI Insights\nThe NIM catalog of containerized AI microservices features more than two dozen healthcare models. Among them are DiffDock, which predicts the 3D structure of potential drug candidates and their protein candidates, and ESMFold, which can predict protein structure based on a single amino acid sequence.\nAnother NIM, MolMIM, generates drug candidates optimized for properties defined by the user \u2014 and is even able to design molecules that are optimized to bind to a specific protein target.\nDevelopers can access production-grade NIM microservices through NVIDIA AI Enterprise using NVIDIA-Certified Systems on premises as well as leading cloud marketplaces, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\n100+ Companies Integrate BioNeMo-Powered AI Into Drug Discovery Workflows\nNVIDIA BioNeMo is being used by more than 100 companies worldwide, including:\n\nAstellas Pharma: The Tokyo-based company is using BioNeMo to accelerate molecular simulations and large language models for drug discovery applications. The company will use the Tokyo-1 AI supercomputer to further advance its work.\nCadence: A leading developer of computation software, San Jose, Calif.-based Cadence is integrating BioNeMo microservices with its Orion platform to accelerate molecular simulation.\nIambic: Based in San Diego, the drug discovery company has adopted BioNeMo and will contribute its NeuralPLexer model as a BioNeMo cloud API, or application programming interface, for noncommercial use, helping researchers predict how a protein\u2019s 3D structure changes in response to a drug molecule.\nInsilico Medicine: A premier member of the NVIDIA Inception program for startups, New York City-based Insilico has integrated BioNeMo in its AI-accelerated drug discovery workflow, developing a pipeline of over 30 therapeutic assets \u2014 including six in clinical stages.\nRecursion: The Salt Lake City-based drug discovery company is a hosting partner offering its Phenom-Beta AI model through BioNeMo. The transformer model extracts insights from cellular microscopy images to help researchers better understand cell function.\nTerray Therapeutics: The biotech company, based in Southern California,\u00a0 is using BioNeMo to help develop a multi-target structural binding model \u2014 and is training generative AI models for small molecule design on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\n\nDiscover the latest in AI and healthcare at GTC, a global AI conference running in San Jose, Calif., and online through Thursday, March 21.

Then, the application summarizes the interaction and creates justifications for action, which are passed on to a human analyst to decide appropriate next steps.\nIn this way, event-driven RAG lets humans oversee security measures while generative AI dramatically accelerates the brunt of the research and investigative tasks that would typically take up to days for completion.\nEnterprises Harness NVIDIA Generative AI for Security\nNVIDIA is using the application to ensure the security of its own internal software development workflows.\nOn average, the application in seconds performs over 400 internet searches and makes more than 500 queries on various enterprise data sources to analyze a single software container \u2014 a task that would typically take a human up to days. NVIDIA scans 1,000+ containers per day.\nCybersecurity leader CrowdStrike is collaborating with NVIDIA to implement generative AI and RAG.\n\u201cOur industry has reached a crucial pivot point as AI becomes an equalizer for security teams and adversaries,\u201d said Sven Krasser, senior vice president and chief scientist at CrowdStrike. \u201cToday, threat actors are leveraging the latest AI advancements to compromise organizations with increased velocity. To stay one step ahead, security and operations teams need advanced threat detection and response capabilities that force-multiply their efforts by coupling together the power of data with targeted AI to accelerate investigations, identify potential vulnerabilities and prevent breaches in their environments.\u201d\nNIM, NeMo Retriever and Morpheus are available through NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a cloud-native software platform that provides accelerated and efficient runtime for generative AI foundation models. It streamlines generative AI adoption with security, stability, manageability and support.\nAvailability\nDevelopers can experiment with NVIDIA microservices for free at ai.nvidia.com. Enterprises can deploy production-grade NIM microservices with NVIDIA AI Enterprise 5.0 running on NVIDIA-Certified Systems and leading cloud marketplaces.\nSee the software security application in action by joining Cybersecurity Developer Day at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference running through Thursday, March 21, online and at the San Jose Convention Center.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | GTC 2024 | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Open Source \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unlike traditional or multimodal LLMs that primarily process and generate text-based data, VLMs can analyze and generate text via images or videos.\nAnd retrieval-augmented generations allows manufacturers to access knowledge from a specific database or the web to assist drivers.\nThese technologies together enable NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, and multimodal language models to work together with the NVIDIA DRIVE platform to let automotive manufacturers develop their own intelligent in-car assistants.\nFor example, an Avatar configurator can allow designers to build unique, brand-inspired personas for their cars, complete with customized voices and emotional attributes. These AI-animated avatars can engage in natural dialogue, providing real-time assistance, recommendations and personalized interactions.\nFurthermore, AI-enhanced surround visualization enhances vehicle safety using 360-degree camera reconstruction, while the intelligent assistant sources external information, such as local driving laws, to inform decision-making.\nPersonalization is paramount, with AI assistants learning driver and passenger habits and adapting its behavior to suit occupants\u2019 needs.\nGenerative AI for Automotive in Full Force at GTC\u00a0\nSeveral NVIDIA partners at GTC are also showcasing their latest generative AI developments using NVIDIA\u2019s edge-to-cloud technology:\n\nCerence\u2019s CaLLM is an automotive-specific LLM that serves as the foundation for the company\u2019s next-gen in-car computing platform, running on NVIDIA DRIVE. The platform, unveiled late last year, is the future of in-car interaction, with an automotive- and mobility-specific assistant that provides an integrated in-cabin experience. Cerence is collaborating with NVIDIA engineering teams for deeper integration of CaLLM with the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models. Through joint efforts, Cerence is harnessing NVIDIA DGX Cloud as the development platform, applying guardrails for enhanced performance, and leveraging NVIDIA AI Enterprise to optimize inference. NVIDIA and Cerence will continue to partner and pioneer this solution together with several automotive OEMs this year.\nWavye is helping usher in the new era of Embodied AI for autonomy, their next-generation AV2.0 approach is characterized by a large Embodied AI foundation model that learns to drive self-supervised using AI end-to-end \u2014from sensing, as an input, to outputting driving actions. The British startup has already unveiled its GAIA-1, a generative world model for AV development running on NVIDIA; alongside LINGO-1, a closed-loop driving commentator that uses natural language to enhance the learning and explainability of AI driving models.\nLi Auto unveiled its multimodal cognitive model, Mind GPT, in June. Built on NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, an open-source library, it serves as the basis for the electric vehicle maker\u2019s AI assistant, Lixiang Tongxue, for scene understanding, generation, knowledge retention and reasoning capabilities. Li Auto is currently developing DriveVLM to enhance autonomous driving capabilities, enabling the system to understand complex scenarios, particularly those that are challenging for traditional AV pipelines, such as unstructured roads, rare and unusual objects, and unexpected traffic events. This advanced model is trained on the NVIDIA GPUs and utilizes TensorRT-LLM and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for data generation in the data center. With inference optimized by NVIDIA DRIVE and TensorRT-LLM, DriveVLMs perform efficiently on embedded systems.\nNIO launched its NOMI GPT, which offers a number of functional experiences, including NOMI Encyclopedia Q&A, Cabin Atmosphere Master and Vehicle Assistant. With the capabilities enabled by LLMs and an efficient computing platform powered by NVIDIA AI stacks, NOMI GPT is capable of basic speech recognition and command execution functions and can use deep learning to understand and process more complex sentences and instructions inside the car.\nGeely is working with NVIDIA to provide intelligent cabin experiences, along with accelerated edge-to-cloud deployment. Specifically, Geely is applying generative AI and LLM technology to provide smarter, personalized and safer driving experiences, using natural language processing, dialogue systems and predictive analytics for intelligent navigation and voice assistants. When deploying LLMs into production, Geely uses NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM to achieve highly efficient inference. For more complex tasks or scenarios requiring massive data support, Geely plans to deploy large-scale models in the cloud.\nWaabi is building AI for self-driving and will use the generative AI capabilities afforded by NVIDIA DRIVE Thor for its breakthrough autonomous trucking solutions, bringing safe and reliable autonomy to the trucking industry.\nLenovo is unveiling a new AI acceleration engine, dubbed UltraBoost, which will run on NVIDIA DRIVE, and features an AI model engine and AI compiler tool chains to facilitate the deployment of LLMs within vehicles.\nSoundHound AI is using NVIDIA to run its in-vehicle voice interface \u2014 which combines both real-time and generative AI capabilities \u2014 even when a vehicle has no cloud connectivity. This solution also offers drivers access to SoundHound\u2019s Vehicle Intelligence product, which instantly delivers settings, troubleshooting and other information directly from the car manual and other data sources via natural speech, as opposed to through a physical document.\nTata Consultancy Services (part of the TATA Group), through its AI-based technology and engineering innovation, has built its automotive GenAI suite powered by NVIDIA GPUs and software frameworks. It accelerates the design, development, and validation of software-defined vehicles, leveraging the various LLMs and VLMs for in-vehicle and cloud-based systems.\nMediaTek is announcing four automotive systems-on-a-chip within its Dimensity Auto Cockpit portfolio, offering powerful AI-based in-cabin experiences for the next generation of intelligent vehicles that span from premium to entry level. To support deep learning capabilities, the Dimensity Auto Cockpit chipsets integrate NVIDIA\u2019s next-gen GPU-accelerated AI computing and NVIDIA RTX-powered graphics to run LLMs in the car, allowing vehicles to support chatbots, rich content delivery to multiple displays, driver alertness detection and other AI-based safety and entertainment applications.\n\nCheck out the many automotive talks on generative AI and LLMs throughout the week of GTC.\nRegister today to attend GTC in person, or tune in virtually, to explore how generative AI is making transportation safer, smarter and more enjoyable.\n\n\nCategories: DrivingTags: DGX Cloud | GTC 2024 | NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many are using NVIDIA Earth-2, a full-stack, open platform for accelerating climate and weather simulation and predictions.\nEarth-2 comprises GPU-accelerated numerical weather and climate prediction models, including ICON and IFS; state-of-the-art AI-driven weather models, such as FourCastNet, GraphCast and Deep Learning Weather Prediction, offered through the NVIDIA Modulus framework; and large-scale, interactive, high-resolution data visualization and simulation enabled by the NVIDIA Omniverse platform. These capabilities are also available via cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces.\nVarious members of NVIDIA Inception \u2014 a free, global program for cutting-edge startups \u2014 are pioneering climate AI advancements with Earth-2. It\u2019s critical work, as extreme-weather events are expected to take a million lives and cost $1.7 trillion per year by 2050.\nTomorrow.io Powers Weather Predictions of Tomorrow\n\nBoston-based Tomorrow.io provides actionable, weather-related insights to countries, businesses and individuals by applying advanced AI and machine learning models to a proprietary global dataset collected from satellites, radar and other sensors. Its weather intelligence and climate adaptation platform delivers high-resolution, accurate weather forecasts across time zones for both short- and long-term projections.\nThe startup is using Earth-2 to study the potential impacts of its suite of satellites on global model forecasts. By conducting observing-system simulation experiments, or OSSEs, with Earth-2 AI forecast models, Tomorrow.io can identify the optimal configurations of satellites and other instruments to improve weather-forecasting conditions. The work ultimately aims to offer users precision and simplicity, helping them easily understand complex weather situations and make the right operational decisions at the right time.\nLearn more about Tomorrow.io\u2019s work with Earth-2 by joining the GTC session, \u201cGlobal Strategies: Startups, Venture Capital, and Climate Change Solutions,\u201d taking place today, March 19, at 3 p.m. PT, at the San Jose Convention Center and online.\nClimaSens Advances Flood-Risk Management With AI\nClimaSens, based in Melbourne, Australia, and New York, fuses historical, real-time and future climate and weather information using advanced AI models. FloodSens, its upcoming flood risk analysis model, informs clients about the probability of flooding from rainfall, offering high-resolution assessments of flash flooding, riverine flooding and all types of flooding in between.\n\nFloodSens, now in beta, was developed using Earth-2 APIs and the FourCastNet model for high-fidelity, physically accurate representations of future weather conditions, as well as an ensemble of other models for assessing the probabilities of low-likelihood, high-impact flooding events. Through this work, the startup aims to enable a more resilient, sustainable future for communities worldwide.\nNorth.io Garners Ocean Insights With AI and Accelerated Modeling\nBased in Kiel, Germany, north.io is helping to map the Earth\u2019s largest carbon sink: oceans. Only about 25% of the ocean floor \u2014 a critical source of the world\u2019s renewable energy and food security \u2014 has been mapped so far.\nNorth.io is collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and making it accessible, shareable, visualizable and understandable for users across the globe through its TrueOcean platform.\nUsing Earth-2 APIs, north.io is developing AI weather forecasts for intelligent operational planning, system management and risk assessment for its AUVs. The combination of high-precision weather modeling and the use of autonomous systems drastically reduces human safety risks in rough, offshore environments.\nLearn more about the latest AI, high performance computing and sustainable computing advancements for climate research at GTC, running through Thursday, March 21.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | GTC 2024 | High-Performance Computing | Inception | NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo | Omniverse | Science | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Project GR00T leverages various tools from the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform to create AI for humanoid robots.\n\u201cBuilding foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today,\u201d said Huang. \u201cThe enabling technologies are coming together for leading roboticists around the world to take giant leaps toward artificial general robotics.\u201d\nNVIDIA also announced a new computer for humanoid robots based on the NVIDIA Thor system-on-a-chip, and new tools for the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform, including Isaac Lab for robot learning and NVIDIA OSMO for hybrid-cloud workflow orchestration, which are instrumental in the development of Project GR00T and foundation models for robots.\nIntroducing Isaac Manipulator for Robotic Arms\n\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA Isaac Manipulator offers a collection of state-of-the-art motion generation and modular AI capabilities for robotic arms, with a robust collection of foundation models and GPU-accelerated libraries.\nRobotics developers can use combinations of software components customized for specific tasks to perceive and interact with surroundings, enabling the building of scalable and repeatable workflows for dynamic manipulation tasks by accelerating AI model training and task programming. \n\u201cIncorporating new tools for foundation model generation into the Isaac platform accelerates the development of smarter, more flexible robots that can be generalized to do many tasks,\u201d said Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA.\nLeading robotics companies Yaskawa, Solomon, PickNik Robotics, READY Robotics, Franka Robotics and Universal Robots, a Teradyne company, are partnering with NVIDIA to bring Isaac Manipulator to their customers.\n\u201cBy bringing NVIDIA AI tools and capabilities to Yaskawa\u2019s automation solutions, we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of where robots can be deployed across industries,\u201c said Masahiro Ogawa, President, Yaskawa. \u201cThis will significantly influence various industries.\u201d\n\nNVIDIA is introducing foundation models to augment existing robot manipulation systems. These will help develop robots to sense, adapt and reprogram for varied environments and applications in smart manufacturing, handling pick-and-place tasks, machine tending and assembly with the following:\n\n\nFoundationPose is a pioneering foundation model for 6D pose estimation and tracking of previously unseen objects.\ncuMotion taps into the parallel processing of NVIDIA GPUs for solving robot motion planning problems at industrial scale by running many trajectory optimizations at the same time to provide the best solution.\nFoundationGrasp is a transformer-based model that can make dense grasp predictions for unknown 3D objects.\nSyntheticaDETR is an object detection model for indoor environments that allows faster detection, rendering and training with new objects.\n\nIntroducing Isaac Perceptor for Autonomous Mobile Robots Visual AI\n\nManufacturing and fulfillment operations are adopting autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to improve efficiency and worker safety as well as to reduce error rates and costs.\nIsaac Perceptor provides multi-camera, 360-degree vision capabilities, offering early industry partners\u00a0 such as ArcBest, BYD and KION Group advanced visual AI for their AMR installations that assist in material handling operations.\nThe NVIDIA Nova Orin DevKit \u2014 created in collaboration with Segway Robotics and Leopard Imaging \u2014 allows companies to quickly develop, evaluate and deploy Isaac Perceptor.\n\u201cArcBest is collaborating with NVIDIA to bring leading-edge machine vision technology into the logistics space,\u201d said Michael Newcity, chief innovation officer of ArcBest and president of ArcBest Technologies. \u201cUsing the Isaac Perceptor platform in our Vaux Smart Autonomy AMR forklifts and reach trucks enables better perception, semantic-aware navigation and 3D mapping for obstacle detection in material handling processes across warehouses, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities.\u201d\nProject GR00T for Humanoid Robotics Development Takes a Bow\nDemonstrated at GTC, GR00T-powered humanoid robots can take multimodal instructions \u2014 text, video and demonstrations \u2014 as well as their previous interactions to produce the desired action for the robot. GR00T was shown on four humanoid robots from different companies, including Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Fourier Intelligence and Unitree Robotics. Agility Robotics and Unitree Robotics are members of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups.\nHumanoid robots are complex systems that require heterogeneous computing to meet the needs of high-frequency low-level controls, sensor fusion and perception, task planning and human-robot interaction. NVIDIA unveiled a new Jetson Thor-based computer for humanoid robots, built on the NVIDIA Thor SoC.\nJetson Thor includes a next-generation GPU based on the NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture with a transformer engine delivering 800 teraflops of 8-bit floating point AI performance to run multimodal generative AI models like GR00T. With an integrated functional safety processor, a high-performance CPU cluster and 100GB of ethernet bandwidth, it significantly simplifies design and integration efforts.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nProject GR00T uses Isaac tools that are available to robotics developers for building and testing foundation models. These include Isaac Lab, a new lightweight simulation app built in Isaac Sim to train this humanoid robot model at scale, and OSMO, a cloud workflow orchestration platform for managing the training and simulation workloads.\nAccelerating Robot Learning With Isaac Lab\nRobots that require advanced locomotion skills, whether with walking or grasping, need to use deep reinforcement learning in a simulated environment and be trained repeatedly in a virtual environment to learn skills. However, this utility becomes more useful when the model transfers to the real robot deployment, which has been demonstrated with Project GR00T.\nAs the successor to Isaac Gym, Isaac Lab benefits from NVIDIA Omniverse technologies for physics-informed, photorealistic, perception-based reinforcement learning tasks. Isaac Lab is an open-source, performance-optimized application for robot learning built on the Isaac Sim platform. It incorporates reinforcement learning APIs and a developer-friendly tasking framework.\nEnabling Cloud-Native Robotics Workflow Scheduling With NVIDIA OSMO\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNVIDIA OSMO scales workloads across distributed environments. For robotics workloads with complex multi-stage and multi-container workflows, the platform provides a location-agnostic deployment option and dataset management and traceability features for deployed models.\n\u201cBoston Dynamics employs a range of machine learning, reinforcement learning and AI technologies to power our robots,\u201d said Pat Marion, machine learning and perception lead at Boston Dynamics. \u201cTo effectively manage the large training workloads, we\u2019re using NVIDIA OSMO, an infrastructure solution that lets our machine learning engineers streamline their workflows and dedicate their expertise to tackling the hard robotics problems.\u201d\nOSMO supports GR00T, for example, by concurrently running models on NVIDIA DGX for training and NVIDIA OVX servers for live reinforcement learning in simulation. This workload involves generating and training models iteratively in a loop. OSMO\u2019s ability to manage and schedule workloads across distributed environments allows for the seamless coordination of DGX and OVX systems, enabling efficient and iterative model development. Once the model is ready for testing and validation, OSMO can uniquely orchestrate software-in-the-loop workflows on OVX (x86-64) as well as hardware-in-the-loop workflows with NVIDIA Jetson (aarch64) compute resources.\nSupporting the ROS Ecosystem of Developers\nNVIDIA joined the Open Source Robotics Alliance (OSRA) as a founding member and platinum sponsor. OSRA is a new initiative by Open Source Robotics Foundation to foster collaboration, innovation and technical guidance in the robotics community by supporting several open-source robotics projects, including the Robot Operating System (ROS).\n\u201cThe increasing capability of autonomous robots is driving a rise in demand for more powerful but still energy-efficient onboard computing,\u201d said Vanessa Yamzon Orsi, CEO of Open Robotics. \u201cThe ROS community is experiencing this demand firsthand, and our users are increasingly taking advantage of advanced accelerated computing hardware from industry leaders such as NVIDIA.\u201d\nNVIDIA Isaac Perceptor with Nova Orin evaluation kit, Isaac Manipulator, Isaac Lab and OSMO will be made available to customers and partners in the second quarter of this year.

Since then, AI on RTX PCs and workstations has grown into a thriving ecosystem with more than 100 million users and 500 AI applications.\nGenerative AI is now ushering in a new wave of capabilities from PC to cloud. And NVIDIA\u2019s rich history and expertise in AI is helping ensure all users have the performance to handle a wide range of AI features.\nUsers at home and in the office are already taking advantage of AI on RTX with productivity- and entertainment-enhancing software. Gamers feel the benefits of AI on GeForce RTX GPUs with higher frame rates at stunning resolutions in their favorite titles. Creators can focus on creativity, instead of watching spinning wheels or repeating mundane tasks. And developers can streamline workflows using generative AI for prototyping and to automate debugging.\nThe field of AI is moving fast. As research advances, AI will tackle more complex tasks. And the demanding performance needs will be handled by RTX.\nWhat Is AI?\nIn its most fundamental form, artificial intelligence is a smarter type of computing. It\u2019s the capability of a computer program or a machine to think, learn and take actions without being explicitly coded with commands to do so, or a user having to control each command.\nAI can be thought of as the ability for a device to perform tasks autonomously, by ingesting and analyzing enormous amounts of data, then recognizing patterns in that data \u2014 often referred to as being \u201ctrained.\u201d\nAI development is always oriented around developing systems that perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, and often significant levels of input, to complete \u2014 only at speeds beyond any individual\u2019s or group\u2019s capabilities. For this reason, AI is broadly seen as both disruptive and highly transformational.\nA key benefit of AI systems is the ability to learn from experiences or patterns inside data, adjusting conclusions on their own when fed new inputs or data. This self-learning allows AI systems to accomplish a stunning variety of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, language translation, medical diagnostics, car navigation, image and video enhancement, and hundreds of other use cases.\nThe next step in the evolution of AI is content generation \u2014 referred to as generative AI. It enables users to quickly create new content, and iterate on it, based on a variety of inputs, which can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models or other types of data. It then generates new content in the same or a new form.\nPopular language applications, like the cloud-based ChatGPT, allow users to generate long-form copy based on a short text request. Image generators like Stable Diffusion turn descriptive text inputs into the desired image. New applications are turning text into video and 2D images into 3D renderings.\nGeForce RTX AI PCs and NVIDIA RTX Workstations\nAI PCs are computers with dedicated hardware designed to help AI run faster. It\u2019s the difference between sitting around waiting for a 3D image to load, and seeing it update instantaneously with an AI denoiser.\n\nOn RTX GPUs, these specialized AI accelerators are called Tensor Cores. And they dramatically speed up AI performance across the most demanding applications for work and play.\nOne way that AI performance is measured is in teraops, or trillion operations per second (TOPS). Similar to an engine\u2019s horsepower rating, TOPS can give users a sense of a PC\u2019s AI performance with a single metric. The current generation of GeForce RTX GPUs offers performance options that range from roughly 200 AI TOPS all the way to over 1,300 TOPS, with many options across laptops and desktops in between. Professionals get even higher AI performance with the NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPU.\nTo put this in perspective, the current generation of AI PCs without GPUs range from 10 to 45 TOPS.\nMore and more types of AI applications will require the benefits of having a PC capable of performing certain AI tasks locally \u2014 meaning on the device rather than running in the cloud. Benefits of running on an AI PC include that computing is always available, even without an internet connection; systems offer low latency for high responsiveness; and increased privacy so that users don\u2019t have to upload sensitive materials to an online database before it becomes usable by an AI.\nAI for Everyone\nRTX GPUs bring more than just performance. They introduce capabilities only possible with RTX technology. Many of these AI features are accessible \u2014 and impactful \u2014 to millions, regardless of the individual\u2019s skill level.\nFrom AI upscaling to improved video conferencing to intelligent, personalizable chatbots, there are tools to benefit all types of users.\n\nRTX Video uses AI to upscale streaming video and display it in HDR. Bringing lower-resolution video in standard dynamic range to vivid, up to 4K high-resolution high dynamic range. RTX users can enjoy the feature with one-time, one-click enablement on nearly any video streamed in a Chrome or Edge browser.\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast, a free app for RTX users with a straightforward user interface, has a host of AI features that improve video conferencing and livestreaming. It removes unwanted background sounds like clicky keyboards, vacuum cleaners and screaming children with Noise and Echo Removal. It can replace or blur backgrounds with better edge detection using Virtual Background. It smooths low-quality camera images with Video Noise Removal. And it can stay centered on the screen with eyes looking at the camera no matter where the user moves, using Auto Frame and Eye Contact.\nChat with RTX is a local, personalized AI chatbot demo that\u2019s easy to use and free to download.\nThe tech demo, originally released in January, will get an update with Google\u2019s Gemma soon.\nUsers can easily connect local files on a PC to a supported large language model simply by dropping files into a single folder and pointing the demo to the location. It enables queries for quick, contextually relevant answers.\nSince Chat with RTX runs locally on Windows with GeForce RTX PCs and NVIDIA RTX workstations, results are fast \u2014 and the user\u2019s data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.\nAI for Gamers\nOver the past six years, game performance has seen the greatest leaps with AI acceleration. Gamers have been turning NVIDIA DLSS on since 2019, boosting frame rates and improving image quality. It\u2019s a technique that uses AI to generate pixels in video games automatically. With ongoing improvements, it now increases frame rates by up to 4x.\n\nAnd with the introduction of Ray Reconstruction in the latest version, DLSS 3.5, visual quality is further enhanced in some of the world\u2019s top titles, setting a new standard for visually richer and more immersive gameplay.\nThere are now over 500 games and applications that have revolutionized the ways people play and create with ray tracing, DLSS and AI-powered technologies.\nBeyond frames, AI is set to improve the way gamers interact with characters and remaster classic games.\n\nNVIDIA ACE microservices \u2014 including generative AI-powered speech and animation models \u2014 are enabling developers to add intelligent, dynamic digital avatars to games. Demonstrated at CES, ACE won multiple awards for its ability to bring game characters to life as a glimpse into the future of PC gaming.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix, a platform for modders to create stunning RTX remasters of classic games, delivers generative AI tools that can transform basic textures from classic games into modern, 4K-resolution, physically based rendering materials. Several projects have already been released or are in the works, including Half-Life 2 RTX and Portal with RTX.\nAI for Creators\nAI is unlocking creative potential by reducing or automating tedious tasks, freeing up time for pure creativity. These features run fastest or solely on PCs with NVIDIA RTX or GeForce RTX GPUs.\nAdobe Premiere Pro\u2019s AI-powered Enhance Speech tool removes unwanted noise and improves dialogue quality.\nAdobe Premiere Pro\u2019s Enhance Speech tool is accelerated by RTX, using AI to remove unwanted noise and improve the quality of dialogue clips so they sound professionally recorded. It\u2019s up to 4.5x faster on RTX vs. Mac. Another Premiere feature, Auto Reframe, uses GPU acceleration to identify and track the most relevant elements in a video and intelligently reframes video content for different aspect ratios.\n\nAnother time-saving AI feature for video editors is DaVinci Resolve\u2019s Magic Mask. Previously, if editors needed to adjust the color/brightness of a subject in one shot or remove an unwanted object, they\u2019d have to use a combination of rotoscoping techniques or basic power windows and masks to isolate the subject from the background.\nMagic Mask has completely changed that workflow. With it, simply draw a line over the subject and the AI will process for a moment before revealing the selection. And GeForce RTX laptops can run the feature 2.5x faster than the fastest non-RTX laptops.\nThis is just a sample of the ways that AI is increasing the speed of creativity. There are now more than 125 AI applications accelerated by RTX.\nAI for Developers\nAI is enhancing the way developers build software applications through scalable environments, hardware and software optimizations, and new APIs.\nNVIDIA AI Workbench helps developers quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs using PC-class performance and memory footprint. It\u2019s a unified, easy-to-use toolkit that can scale from running locally on RTX PCs to virtually any data center, public cloud or NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nAfter building AI models for PC use cases, developers can optimize them using NVIDIA TensorRT \u2014 the software that helps developers take full advantage of the Tensor Cores in RTX GPUs.\nTensorRT acceleration is now available in text-based applications with TensorRT-LLM for Windows. The open-source library increases LLM performance and includes pre-optimized checkpoints for popular models, including Google\u2019s Gemma, Meta Llama 2, Mistral and Microsoft Phi-2.\nDevelopers also have access to a TensorRT-LLM wrapper for the OpenAI Chat API. With just one line of code change, continue.dev \u2014 an open-source autopilot for VS Code and JetBrains that taps into an LLM \u2014 can use TensorRT-LLM locally on an RTX PC for fast, local LLM inference using this popular tool.\nEvery week, we\u2019ll demystify AI by making the technology more accessible, and we\u2019ll showcase new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX AI PC users.\nThe iPhone moment of AI is here, and it\u2019s just the beginning.

They include the NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122 cuDF library, which accelerates the work of the nearly 10 million data scientists using pandas software by up to 110x using an NVIDIA RTX\u2122 6000 Ada Generation GPU instead of a CPU-only system, without requiring any code changes.\nRAPIDS cuDF and other NVIDIA software will be available as part of Z by HP AI Studio on HP AI workstations to provide a full-stack development solution that speeds data science workflows.\n\u201cPandas is the essential tool of millions of data scientists processing and preparing data for generative AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO at NVIDIA. \u201cAccelerating pandas with zero code changes will be a massive step forward. Data scientists can process data in minutes rather than hours, and wrangle orders of magnitude more data to train generative AI models.\u201d\n\u201cData science provides the foundation for AI, and developers need fast access to software and systems to power this critical work,\u201d said Enrique Lores, president and CEO of HP Inc. \u201cWith the integration of NVIDIA AI software and accelerated GPU compute, HP AI workstations provide a powerful solution for our customers.\u201d\nNVIDIA CUDA-X Speeds Data Science on HP Workstation Solutions\r\nPandas provides a powerful data structure, called DataFrames, which lets developers easily manipulate, clean and analyze tabular data.\nThe NVIDIA RAPIDS cuDF library accelerates pandas so that it can run on GPUs with zero code changes, rather than relying on CPUs, which can slow workloads as data size grows. RAPIDS cuDF is compatible with third-party libraries and unifies GPU and CPU workflows so data scientists can develop, test and run models in production seamlessly.\nAs datasets continue to grow, RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs provide 48GB of memory per GPU to process large data science and AI workloads on Z by HP workstations. With up to four RTX 6000 GPUs, the HP Z8 Fury is one of the world\u2019s most powerful workstations for AI creation. The close collaboration between HP and NVIDIA allows data scientists to streamline development by working on local systems to process even large generative AI workloads.\nAvailability\r\nNVIDIA RAPIDS cuDF for accelerated pandas with zero code changes is expected to be available on HP AI workstations and PCs with NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs this month and on HP AI Studio later this year.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.

The team ran its research on Eos, NVIDIA\u2019s H100 GPU supercomputer.\nSoftware from the effort will be made available for researchers in fields like healthcare and chemistry. Aspuru-Guzik will detail the work in a talk at GTC.\nQuantum Scales for Fraud Detection\nAt HSBC, one of the world\u2019s largest banks, researchers designed a quantum machine learning application that can detect fraud in digital payments.\nThe bank\u2019s quantum machine learning algorithm simulated a whopping 165 qubits on NVIDIA GPUs. Research papers typically don\u2019t extend beyond 40 of these fundamental calculating units quantum systems use.\nHSBC used machine learning techniques implemented with CUDA-Q and cuTensorNet software on NVIDIA GPUs to overcome challenges simulating quantum circuits at scale. Mekena Metcalf, a quantum computing research scientist at HSBC (pictured above), will present her work in a session at GTC.\nRaising a Quantum Generation\nIn education, NVIDIA is working with nearly two dozen universities to prepare the next generation of computer scientists for the quantum era. The collaboration will design curricula and teaching materials around CUDA-Q.\n\u201cBridging the divide between traditional computers and quantum systems is essential to the future of computing,\u201d said Theresa Mayer, vice president for research at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cNVIDIA is partnering with institutions of higher education, Carnegie Mellon included, to help students and researchers navigate and excel in this emerging hybrid environment.\u201d\nTo help working developers get hands-on with the latest tools, NVIDIA co-sponsored QHack, a quantum hackathon in February. The winning project, developed by Gopal Dahale of Qkrishi \u2014 a quantum company in Gurgaon, India \u2014 used CUDA-Q to develop an algorithm to simulate a material critical in designing better batteries.\nA Trio of New Systems\nTwo new systems being deployed further expand the ecosystem for hybrid quantum-classical computing.\nThe largest of the two, ABCI-Q at Japan\u2019s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, will be one of the largest supercomputers dedicated to research in quantum computing. It will use CUDA-Q on NVIDIA H100 GPUs to advance the nation\u2019s efforts in the field.\nIn Denmark, the Novo Nordisk Foundation will lead on the deployment of an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, a significant part of which will be dedicated to research in quantum computing in alignment with the country\u2019s national plan to advance the technology.\nThe new systems join Australia\u2019s Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, which announced in February it will run CUDA-Q on NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips at its National Supercomputing and Quantum Computing Innovation Hub.\nPartners Drive CUDA-Q Forward\nIn other news, Israeli startup Classiq released at GTC a new integration with CUDA-Q.

But if you\u2019re worried about AI doing your thinking for you, you might be waiting for a while.\nIn a fireside chat Wednesday at NVIDIA GTC, the global AI conference, Kanjun Qiu, CEO of Imbue, and Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA, challenged many of the clich\u00e9s that have long dominated conversations about AI.\nLaunched in October 2022, Imbue made headlines with its Series B fundraiser last year, raising over $200 million at a $1 billion valuation.\nBridging the Gap Between \u2018Idea and Execution\u2019\n\nThe discussion highlighted not only Imbue\u2019s approach toward building practical AI agents able to automate menial, unrewarding work, but also painted a vivid picture of what the next chapter in AI innovation might hold.\n\u201cOur lives are full of so much friction \u2026 every single person\u2019s vision can come to life,\u201d Qiu said. \u201cThe barrier between idea and execution can be much smaller.\u201d\nCatanzaro\u2019s reflections on the practical difficulties of using AI for simple tasks, such as his own challenges trying to get his digital assistant to help him find his next meeting, underscored the current limitations in human-AI interaction.\nIt turns out that figuring out where and when to go to a meeting, while easy for a human assistant, isn\u2019t easy to automate.\n\u201cWe tend to underestimate the things that we do naturally and overestimate the things that require reasoning,\u201d Catanzaro observed. \u201cOne of the things humans deal with well is ambiguity.\u201d\nThis set the stage for a broader discussion of the need for AI to move beyond mere code generation and become a dynamic, intuitive interface between humans and computers.\nQiu said the idea that AI can be a magical assistant, one that knows everything about you \u201cisn\u2019t necessarily the right paradigm.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because delegation is hard.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m delegating something, even to a human, I have to think a lot about \u2018okay, how can I package this up so that the person will do the right thing?\u2019\u201d\nInstead, the better model might be telling your computer to do anything you want. So you\u2019re \u201ctelling your computer to do stuff and the agent is a middle layer,\u201d she said.\nSuch agents will need to be able to interact with people \u2014 something often described as \u201creasoning,\u201d the two observed \u2014 and communicate with computers \u2014 or \u201ccode.\u201d\nA Vision for Empowerment Through Technology\nQiu and Catanzaro \u2014 who often completed each other\u2019s sentences during the 45-minute conversation \u2014 compared AI\u2019s potential to democratize software creation to the Industrial Revolution\u2019s impact on manufacturing.\nThe parts needed for a steam engine, for example, once took years to create. Now they can be ordered off the shelf for a small sum.\nBoth speakers emphasized the importance of creating intuitive interfaces that allow individuals from nontechnical backgrounds to engage with computers more effectively, fostering a more inclusive digital landscape.\nThat means going beyond coding, which is done in text-heavy environments such as an Integrated Development Environment, or even using text-based chats.\n\u201cThe interface to agents, a lot of them today, is like a chat interface. It\u2019s not a very good interface, in a lot of ways, very restrictive. And so there are much better ways of working with these systems,\u201d Qiu said.\nThe Future of Personal Computing\nQiu and Catanzaro discussed the role that virtual worlds will play in this, and how they could serve as interfaces for human-technology interaction.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that AI is going to help build virtual worlds,\u201d said Catanzaro. \u201cI think the maybe more controversial part is virtual worlds are going to be necessary for humans to interact with AI.\u201d\nPeople have an almost primal fear of being displaced, Catanzaro said, but what\u2019s much more likely is that our capabilities will be amplified as the technology fades into the background.\nCatanzaro compared it to the adoption of electricity. A century ago, people talked a lot about electricity. Now that it\u2019s ubiquitous, it\u2019s no longer the focus of broader conversations, even as it makes our day-to-day lives better.\n\u201cI think of it as really being able to [help us] control information environments \u2026 once we have control over information environments, we\u2019ll feel a lot more empowered,\u201d Qiu said. \u201cEvery single person\u2019s vision can come to life.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | GTC 2024 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It aims to enable open innovation and accelerate the delivery of real-time insights at scale to support medical professionals before, during and after procedures.\nJ&J MedTech is in 80% of the world\u2019s operating rooms and trains more than 140,000 healthcare professionals each year through its education programs.\nSeeking to bring together its legacy and digital ecosystem in surgery with NVIDIA\u2019s leading AI solutions \u2014 including the NVIDIA IGX edge computing platform and NVIDIA Holoscan edge AI platform for building medical devices \u2014 J&J MedTech can accelerate the infrastructure needed to deploy AI-powered software applications for surgery. IGX and Holoscan can support secure, real-time processing from devices across the operating room to provide clinical insights and improve surgical outcomes.\nUnveiled at NVIDIA GTC, the global AI conference taking place March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online, this work could also facilitate the deployment of third-party models and applications developed across the digital surgery ecosystem by providing a common AI compute platform.\n\u201cAI models are currently being created by experts in surgery in various parts of the world,\u201d said Shan Jegatheeswaran, vice president and global head of digital at J&J MedTech. \u201cIf we can create a trusted, open ecosystem that enables and accelerates coordination, it would create a flywheel of innovation where different groups can collaborate and connect at scale, improving access to advanced analytics across the surgical experience.\u201d\nAn Open Ecosystem for AI Innovation: Building on NVIDIA Holoscan and IGX\u00a0\nJ&J MedTech is working with NVIDIA to test how industrial-grade edge AI capabilities purpose-built for medical environments could benefit surgery.\n\u201cOur connected digital ecosystem will help break down the traditional barriers to entry for developers seeking to build applications and deploy analytics in the operating room,\u201d Jegatheeswaran said. \u201cWe\u2019re making it simpler for those who want to participate in the surgical workflow by eliminating the heavy lifting of building a secure, enterprise-grade platform.\u201d\nNVIDIA Holoscan accelerates the development and deployment of real-time AI applications to process data streams.\nHoloscan includes reference pipelines to build AI applications for a variety of medical use cases, including endoscopy, ultrasound and other sensors. It runs on NVIDIA IGX, which includes NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules, NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX networking technology to enable high-speed data streaming from medical devices or operating room video feeds.\nNVIDIA supports the IGX software stack with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, the enterprise operating system for production-grade AI.\nFueling Surgical AI With Device Data\nThe J&J MedTech team envisions the potential of NVIDIA-accelerated edge analytics behind its connected digital ecosystem as an enabler of AI-powered applications fueled by device, patient and other surgical data.\nDevelopers could leverage continuous learning, where an algorithm improves based on data collected by the deployed device. Real-world footage collected by an endoscope, for example, could be used to refine an AI model that identifies organs, tissue and potential tumors in real time on an operating room display to support clinical decision-making.\n\u201cSurgical technologies will get more intelligent over time, bringing the power of advanced analytics to surgeons and hospitals,\u201d said Jegatheeswaran. \u201cA collection of AI models could act like driver-assistance technology for surgeons, amplifying their ability to deliver care while reducing cognitive load.\u201d\nOne example is AI that removes personally identifiable information from surgical videos so they can be used downstream for research purposes \u2014 or, when processed in real time, enable hospitals to bring in external experts through telepresence to consult during a surgery while maintaining patient privacy.\nFuture applications could enable surgeons to interact with chatbots to gain insights about a patient\u2019s medical history or best practices for handling certain complications. Other models could improve operating room efficiency by using video feeds to understand when a procedure is almost complete, alerting the next surgical team that a room will soon be available.\nDiscover the latest in AI and healthcare at GTC, running in San Jose, Calif., and online through Thursday, March 21.

This centralized occupancy map helps inform optimal AMR routes calculated by the NVIDIA cuOpt engine for solving complex routing problems.\ncuOpt, a record-breaking optimization AI microservice, solves complex routing problems with multiple constraints using GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms.\nAll of this happens in real time, while Isaac Mission Control coordinates the entire fleet using map data and route graphs from cuOpt to send and execute AMR commands.\nAn AI Gym for Industrial Digitalization\nAI agents can assist in large-scale industrial environments by, for example, managing fleets of robots in a factory or identifying streamlined configurations for human-robot collaboration in supply chain distribution centers. To build these complex agents, developers need digital twins that function as AI gyms \u2014 physically accurate environments for AI evaluation, simulation and training.\nSuch software-in-the-loop AI testing enables AI agents and AMRs to adapt to real-world unpredictability.\nIn the above demo, an incident occurs along an AMR\u2019s planned route, blocking the path and preventing it from picking up a pallet. NVIDIA Metropolis updates an occupancy grid, mapping all humans, robots and objects in a single view. cuOpt then plans an optimal route, and the AMR responds accordingly to minimize downtime.\nWith Metropolis vision foundation models powering the NVIDIA Visual Insight Agent (VIA) framework, AI agents can be built to help operations teams answer questions like, \u201cWhat situation occurred in aisle three of the factory?\u201d And the generative AI-powered agent offers immediate insights such as, \u201cBoxes fell from the shelves at 3:30 p.m., blocking the aisle.\u201d\nDevelopers can use the VIA framework to build AI agents capable of processing large amounts of live or archived videos and images with vision-language models \u2014 whether deployed at the edge or in the cloud. This new generation of visual AI agents will help nearly every industry summarize, search and extract actionable insights from video using natural language.\nAll of these AI functions can be enhanced through continuous, simulation-based training and are deployed as modular NVIDIA NIM inference microservices.\nLearn more about the latest advancements in generative AI and industrial digitalization at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference running through Thursday, March 21, at the San Jose Convention Center and online.\n\n\nCategories: RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | GTC 2024 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Isaac | Metropolis | NVIDIA cuOpt | NVIDIA NIM | Omniverse | Simulation and Design | Visual Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But in between the AI developments, Nvidia has also made a couple of significant robotics announcements.First, there\u2019s Project GR00T (with each letter and number pronounced individually so as not to invoke the wrath of Disney), a foundation model for humanoid robots. And secondly, Nvidia has committed to be the founding platinum member of the Open Source Robotics Alliance, a new initiative from the Open Source Robotics Foundation intended to make sure that the Robot Operating System (ROS), a collection of open-source software libraries and tools, has the support that it needs to flourish.GR00TFirst, let\u2019s talk about GR00T (short for \u201cGeneralist Robot 00 Technology\u201d). The way that Nvidia presenters enunciated it letter-by-letter during their talks strongly suggests that in private they just say \u201cGroot.\u201d So the rest of us can also just say \u201cGroot\u201d as far as I\u2019m concerned.As a \u201cgeneral-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots,\u201d GR00T is intended to provide a starting point for specific humanoid robots to do specific tasks. As you might expect from something being presented for the first time at an Nvidia keynote, it\u2019s awfully vague at the moment, and we\u2019ll have to get into it more later on. Here\u2019s pretty much everything useful that Nvidia has told us so far:\u201cBuilding foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cThe enabling technologies are coming together for leading roboticists around the world to take giant leaps towards artificial general robotics.\u201dRobots powered by GR00T... will be designed to understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human actions\u2014quickly learning coordination, dexterity and other skills in order to navigate, adapt and interact with the real world.This sounds good, but that \u201cwill be\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Like, there\u2019s a very significant \u201chow\u201d missing here. More specifically, we\u2019ll need a better understanding of what\u2019s underlying this foundation model\u2014is there real robot data under there somewhere, or is it based on a massive amount of simulation? Are the humanoid robotic companies involved contributing data to improve GR00T, or instead training their own models based on it? It\u2019s certainly notable that Nvidia is name-dropping most of the heavy-hitters in commercial humanoids, including 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, Fourier Intelligence, Sanctuary AI, Unitree Robotics, and XPENG Robotics. We\u2019ll be able to check in with some of those folks directly this week to hopefully learn more. On the hardware side, Nvidia is also announcing a new computing platform called Jetson Thor:Jetson Thor was created as a new computing platform capable of performing complex tasks and interacting safely and naturally with people and machines. It has a modular architecture optimized for performance, power and size. The SoC includes a next-generation GPU based on NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with a transformer engine delivering 800 teraflops of 8-bit floating point AI performance to run multimodal generative AI models like GR00T. With an integrated functional safety processor, a high-performance CPU cluster and 100GB of ethernet bandwidth, it significantly simplifies design and integration efforts.Speaking of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture\u2014today the company also unveiled its B200 Blackwell GPU. And to round out the announcements, the chip foundry TSMC and Synopsys, an electronic design automation company, each said they will be moving Nvidia\u2019s inverse lithography tool, cuLitho, into production.The Open Source Robotics AllianceThe other big announcement is actually from the Open Source Robotics Foundation, which is launching the Open Source Robotics Alliance (OSRA), a \u201cnew initiative to strengthen the governance of our open-source robotics software projects and ensure the health of the Robot Operating System (ROS) Suite community for many years to come.\u201d Nvidia is an inaugural platinum member of the OSRA, but they\u2019re not alone\u2014other platinum members include Intrinsic and Qualcomm. Other significant members include Apex, Clearpath Robotics, Ekumen, eProsima, PickNik, Silicon Valley Robotics, and Zettascale.\u201cThe [Open Source Robotics Foundation] had planned to restructure its operations by broadening community participation and expanding its impact in the larger ROS ecosystem,\u201d explains Vanessa Yamzon Orsi, CEO of the Open Source Robotics Foundation. \u201cThe sale of [Open Source Robotics Corporation] was the first step towards that vision, and the launch of the OSRA is the next big step towards that change.\u201dWe had time for a brief Q&A with Orsi to better understand how this will affect the ROS community going forward. You structured the OSRA to have a mixed membership and meritocratic model like the Linux Foundation\u2014what does that mean, exactly?Vanessa Yamzon Orsi: We have modeled the OSRA to allow for paths to participation in its activities through both paid memberships (for organizations and their representatives) and the community members who support the projects through their contributions. The mixed model enables participation in the way most appropriate for each organization or individual: contributing funding as a paying member, contributing directly to project development, or both.What are some benefits for the ROS ecosystem that we can look forward to through OSRA?Orsi: We expect the OSRA to benefit the OSRF\u2019s projects in three significant ways.By providing a stable stream of funding to cover the maintenance and development of the ROS ecosystem.By encouraging greater community involvement in development through open processes and open, meritocratic status achievement.By bringing greater community involvement in governance and ensuring that all stakeholders have a voice in decision-making.Why will this be a good thing for ROS users?Orsi: The OSRA will ensure that ROS and the suite of open source projects under the stewardship of Open Robotics will continue to be supported and strengthened for years to come. By providing organized governance and oversight, clearer paths to community participation, and financial support, it will provide stability and structure to the projects while enabling continued development.From Your Site Articlesros - IEEE Spectrum \u203aNvidia Speeds Key Chipmaking Computation by 40x \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebWhat Are Foundation Models? | NVIDIA Blogs \u203ahumanoid robotsjensen huangnvidiaopen sourceopen source robotics foundationqualcommroboticsrostsmcai robotsEvan AckermanEvan Ackerman is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

Also known as Path Tracing, this advanced ray tracing technique is used by visual effects artists to create film and TV graphics that are indistinguishable from reality, but until the arrival of GeForce RTX GPUs with RT Cores, and the AI-powered acceleration of NVIDIA DLSS, Full Ray Tracing in real-time video games was impossible.\nEnabling Full Ray Tracing in Black Myth: Wukong sees environmental effects and detail taken to the next level. Reflections on water reflect all surrounding detail. Water caustics add further realism, accurately rendering the refraction and reflection of light. Fully ray-traced Global Illumination ensures lighting indoors and outdoors is pixel perfect, darkening areas where light is occluded or doesn\u2019t reach, and realistically illuminating the world by bouncing light. And in concert with the lighting system, contact hardening and softening fully ray traced shadows are cast everywhere, rendering the smallest of shadows from leaves and pebbles, and those from geometry-rich buildings, the main character, and the gigantic bosses that must be overcome.\nTake a first look at Black Myth: Wukong with Full Ray Tracing and DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction in the new trailer below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong launches August 20th - wishlist the game on Steam and the Epic Games Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNARAKA: BLADEPOINT Adding Full Ray Tracing & DLSS 3.5\nDeveloped by 24 Entertainment and published by NetEase Games Global, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is a 60-player melee-focused Battle Royale in where players can experience a unique fighting gameplay, combining fast movements in a large environment and a deep and intense melee combat system based on combos, parries, and counters.\nEach week, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam. Having previously added DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex, 24 Entertainment is now upgrading NARAKA: BLADEPOINT with Full Ray Tracing and DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction.\nGlobal Illumination, Reflections, Ambient Occlusion and Shadows will all be enhanced with richer, more detailed Full Ray Tracing, which will be further enhanced by DLSS 3.5\u2019s Ray Reconstruction technology. Take a first look below in our new, exclusive NARAKA: BLADEPOINT Full Ray Tracing & DLSS 3.5 Gameplay Trailer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Full Ray Tracing enabled, the player\u2019s surroundings are perfectly mirrored on water, the environment is naturally and accurately lit, shadows fall realistically across the world, softening as the distance from the shadow caster increases, and the realism of every game element is enhanced with high-fidelity ambient occlusion shading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Full Ray Tracing will be available in three Player versus Player and Player versus Enemy areas, with further areas receiving upgrades over time.\u00a0\nIf you don\u2019t have a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can play NARAKA: BLADEPOINT in the cloud using the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3.5, Full Ray Tracing, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate. NARAKA: BLADEPOINT is already available on GeForce NOW with DLSS 3 and Reflex, and when the Full Ray Tracing update is released it too will be available to play via the cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal with RTX DLSS 3.5 & RTX IO Update Available Now\nPortal with RTX reimagines Valve\u2019s timeless classic using full ray tracing, also known as path tracing, to accurately model the real-world properties of light, and how that light affects every surface and object. Illumination, shadows, reflections, refraction, and everything in between are all a result of the fully ray traced world and their interactions with upgraded assets, adding dazzling detail and dynamism to levels and effects.\nToday, the free game upgrades to NVIDIA DLSS 3.5, leveraging its AI-powered Ray Reconstruction technology to improve the fidelity of full ray tracing, and the responsiveness of dynamic lighting effects. And with the introduction of NVIDIA RTX IO, texture loading times are accelerated, and the file size of the game has been reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the update now on Steam, and get all the details about the tech upgrades, watch comparison videos, and check out DLSS 3.5 performance charts in our Portal with RTX NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and RTX IO article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar WarsTM Outlaws Launching This Year With DLSS 3, Ray Tracing & Reflex\nLater this year, experience the first-ever open world Star Wars\u2122 game, Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws. Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws will invite players to experience the Star Wars galaxy like never before through an original story set between\u00a0 Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2122 and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\u2122.\u00a0 As the Galactic Empire relentlessly pursues the final defeat of the Rebel Alliance, the criminal underworld thrives. Fans will play as cunning scoundrel, Kay Vess and her loyal companion Nix, as they attempt one of the greatest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen. Seeking the means to start a new life, players will join Kay and Nix as they fight, steal, and outwit their way through the galaxy\u2019s crime syndicates and join the galaxy\u2019s most wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHere at Massive Entertainment, worldbuilding is a part of our DNA, and what better way to showcase our craft than creating the first-ever open world Star Wars game. Filled with distinct locations across the galaxy\u2019s outer rim, both iconic and new, players will be able to experience the Star Wars underworld like never before. DLSS 3 gives us the performance headroom to bring our vision to life and to support additional ray tracing features, helping gamers fully immerse themselves in the adventures of Kay Vess and Nix.\u201d - Tobias Carlsson, Technical Director\nNVIDIA has collaborated with Ubisoft and LucasFilm Games to deliver the definitive PC experience for Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws players, leveraging the game-changing technologies of GeForce RTX GPUs to enhance graphics, accelerate performance, and make gameplay even more responsive.\nFrom day one, GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA DLSS 3, multiplying performance with DLSS Frame Generation on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards, and boosting performance considerably with DLSS Super Resolution on all other GeForce RTX GPUs.\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture used in GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels. Through a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7 out of every 8 of the displayed pixels, multiplying performance even in CPU-bound scenarios.\nAdditionally, all GeForce RTX gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex, reducing system latency in Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws. System latency affects the time it takes for actions to occur in-game - the lower your latency, the more responsive a game becomes, and the better the gameplay feels. Available in over 100 games, Reflex is used by over 50 million users each month, and with there being no downsides to the tech whatsoever, it\u2019s a must-have for gamers wanting the most responsive experience possible.\nStar Wars\u2122 Outlaws is built using Massive Entertainment\u2019s incredible Snowdrop Engine, enabling the developers to create the most detailed Star Wars\u2122 experience you\u2019ve ever seen, with perfectly recreated ships and iconic locations, and stunning worlds for you to visit and experience.\u00a0\nAs part of our collaboration, Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws on PC is also being enhanced with NVIDIA RTX Direct Illumination (RTXDI) and ray-traced Global Illumination lighting, taking visuals to the next level. RTXDI figures out the most important light samples in Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws to cast physically accurate ray-traced shadows. Performance remains fast thanks to RTXDI\u2019s innovative design, and on GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs ray tracing gets even faster thanks to each card\u2019s fourth generation, super fast Ray Tracing Cores.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a GeForce RTX PC or laptop, you can still enjoy Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws by streaming it from the cloud with the same technologies as GeForce RTX 40-Series owners, including DLSS 3 and Reflex, thanks to NVIDIA GeForce NOW Ultimate. Members can play over 1,800 of the real and full PC versions of games they already own from Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG.com. Head over to the GeForce NOW website to learn more.\nWe\u2019ll have more to share about the PC technology and features of Star Wars\u2122 Outlaws closer to the game\u2019s release, so be sure to stay tuned to GeForce.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiablo IV Ray Tracing Update Arrives March 26th\nSince launch in June 2023, Diablo IV GeForce RTX gamers have been accelerating performance by 2.5X on average at 4K, thanks to the inclusion of DLSS 3.

AWS will offer the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and B100 Tensor Core GPUs, extending the companies\u2019 long standing strategic collaboration to deliver the most secure and advanced infrastructure, software, and services to help customers unlock new generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\u00a0\nNVIDIA and AWS continue to bring together the best of their technologies, including NVIDIA\u2019s newest multi-node systems featuring the next-generation NVIDIA Blackwell platform and AI software, AWS\u2019s Nitro System and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) advanced security, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) petabit scale networking, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) UltraCluster hyper-scale clustering. Together, they deliver the infrastructure and tools that enable customers to build and run real-time inference on multi-trillion parameter large language models (LLMs) faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2.\n\u201cThe deep collaboration between our two organizations goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world\u2019s first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of NVIDIA GPU solutions for customers,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation Grace Blackwell processor marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing. When combined with AWS\u2019s powerful Elastic Fabric Adapter Networking, Amazon EC2 UltraClusters\u2019 hyper-scale clustering, and our unique Nitro system\u2019s advanced virtualization and security capabilities, we make it possible for customers to build and run multi-trillion parameter large language models faster, at massive scale, and more securely than anywhere else. Together, we continue to innovate to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\u201d\n\u201cAI is driving breakthroughs at an unprecedented pace, leading to new applications, business models, and innovation across industries,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cOur collaboration with AWS is accelerating new generative AI capabilities and providing customers with unprecedented computing power to push the boundaries of what's possible.\u201d\nLatest innovations from AWS and NVIDIA accelerate training of cutting-edge LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters\r\nAWS will offer the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, featuring GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink\u2122. When connected with Amazon\u2019s powerful networking (EFA), and supported by advanced virtualization (AWS Nitro System) and hyper-scale clustering (Amazon EC2 UltraClusters), customers can scale to thousands of GB200 Superchips. NVIDIA Blackwell on AWS delivers a massive leap forward in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\nBased on the success of the NVIDIA H100-powered EC2 P5 instances, which are available to customers for short durations through\u00a0Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, AWS plans to offer EC2 instances featuring the new B100 GPUs deployed in EC2 UltraClusters for accelerating generative AI training and inference at massive scale. GB200s will also be available on\u00a0NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud, an AI platform co-engineered on AWS, that gives enterprise developers dedicated access to the infrastructure and software needed to build and deploy advanced generative AI models. The Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud instances on AWS will accelerate development of cutting-edge generative AI and LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters.\nElevate AI security with AWS Nitro System, AWS KMS, encrypted EFA, and Blackwell encryption\r\nAs customers move quickly to implement AI in their organizations, they need to know that their data is being handled securely throughout their training workflow. The security of model weights \u2014 the parameters that a model learns during training that are critical for its ability to make predictions \u2014 is paramount to protecting customers\u2019 intellectual property, preventing tampering with models, and maintaining model integrity.\nAWS AI infrastructure and services already have security features in place to give customers control over their data and ensure that it is not shared with third-party model providers. The combination of the AWS Nitro System and the NVIDIA GB200 takes AI security even further by preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing model weights. The GB200 allows inline encryption of the NVLink connections between GPUs\u00a0and encrypts data transfers,\u00a0while EFA encrypts data across servers for distributed training and inference. The GB200 will also benefit from the AWS Nitro System, which offloads I/O for functions from the host CPU/GPU to specialized AWS hardware to deliver more consistent performance, while its enhanced security protects customer code and data during processing \u2014 on both the customer side and AWS side. This capability \u2014 available only on AWS \u2014 has been\u00a0independently verified by NCC Group, a leading cybersecurity firm.\nWith the GB200 on Amazon EC2, AWS will enable customers to create a trusted execution environment alongside their EC2 instance, using\u00a0AWS Nitro Enclaves and AWS KMS. Nitro Enclaves allow customers to encrypt their training data and weights with KMS, using key material under their control. The enclave can be loaded from within the GB200 instance and can communicate directly with the GB200 Superchip. This enables KMS to communicate directly with the enclave and pass key material to it in a cryptographically secure way. The enclave can then pass that material to the GB200, protected from the customer instance and preventing AWS operators from ever accessing the key or decrypting the training data or model weights, giving customers unparalleled control over their data.\nProject Ceiba taps Blackwell to propel NVIDIA\u2019s future generative AI innovation on AWS\r\nAnnounced at AWS re:Invent 2023, Project Ceiba is a collaboration between NVIDIA and AWS to build one of the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputers. Hosted exclusively on AWS, the supercomputer is available for NVIDIA\u2019s own research and development. This first-of-its-kind supercomputer with 20,736 B200 GPUs is being built using the new NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, a system featuring fifth-generation NVLink, that scales to 20,736 B200 GPUs connected to 10,368 NVIDIA Grace CPUs. The system scales out using fourth-generation EFA networking, providing up to 800 Gbps per Superchip of low-latency, high-bandwidth networking throughput \u2014 capable of processing a massive 414\u00a0exaflops of AI \u2014 a 6x performance increase over earlier plans to build Ceiba on the Hopper architecture. NVIDIA research and development teams will use Ceiba to advance AI for LLMs, graphics (image/video/3D generation) and simulation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, NVIDIA Earth-2 climate prediction, and more to help NVIDIA propel future generative AI innovation.\nAWS and NVIDIA collaboration accelerates development of generative AI applications and advance use cases in healthcare and life sciences\r\nAWS and NVIDIA have joined forces to offer high-performance, low-cost inference for generative AI with Amazon SageMaker integration with NVIDIA NIM\u2122 inference microservices, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Customers can use this combination to quickly deploy FMs that are pre-compiled and optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs to SageMaker, reducing the time-to-market for generative AI applications.\nAWS and NVIDIA have teamed up to expand computer-aided drug discovery with new\u00a0NVIDIA BioNeMo\u2122 FMs for generative chemistry, protein structure prediction, and understanding how drug molecules interact with targets. These new models will soon be available on AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service that helps healthcare and life sciences organizations store, query, and analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data.\nAWS HealthOmics and NVIDIA Healthcare teams are also working together to launch generative AI microservices to advance drug discovery, medtech, and digital health \u2014 delivering a new catalog of GPU-accelerated cloud endpoints for biology, chemistry, imaging and healthcare data so healthcare enterprises can take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI on AWS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

This level of AI-driven interactivity and player agency opens up new possibilities for emergent gameplay, where players must think on their feet and adapt their strategies in real-time to navigate the intricacies of the game world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt on Unreal Engine 5, Covert Protocol leverages Inworld\u2019s SDK to make integrating with MetaHuman fast and simple, and incorporates NVIDIA ACE technologies, including NVIDIA Riva Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and NVIDIA Audio2Face (A2F) to augment Inworld\u2019s speech and animation pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe combination of NVIDIA ACE microservices and the Inworld Engine enables developers to create digital characters that can drive dynamic narratives, opening new possibilities for how gamers can decipher, deduce and play.\u201d said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of Inworld AI.\nTo accelerate developer adoption, Inworld will be releasing Covert Protocol\u2019s source code in the near future, enabling developers to learn from the tech demo, and use it to create their own innovations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbisoft\u2019s NEO NPCs Explores the Possibilities of Digital Humans in Games with Inworld AI & NVIDIA ACE Technologies\u00a0\nUbisoft is exploring new types of interactive gameplay with dynamic Non Player Characters (NPCs), a field that is being revolutionized with the emergence of generative AI technologies. \u201cNEO NPCs\u201d the product of their latest research and development project are advanced NPCs designed to interact in real time with players, their environment and other characters, opening up new possibilities for dynamic and emergent storytelling.\nUbisoft showcased the capabilities of these NEO NPCs through three separate demo scenarios. Each scenario focuses on different aspects of NPC behaviors, environmental and contextual awareness; a spectrum of real-time reactions and animations; as well as conversation memory, collaboration and strategic decision-making. Combined, these discoveries through the experiment pushes the boundaries of game design and immersion.\nWith NEO NPCs, Ubisoft\u2019s narrative and animation designers blended the reliability of scripted game elements with the dynamism of spontaneous player interactions, nudging the future of game development towards new horizons.\nLeveraging Inworld AI technology, Ubisoft\u2019s narrative team created two NEO NPCs, Bloom and Iron, who have their own background story, knowledge base, and different conversational styles to establish these unique characters in the demo universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nInworld technology also provides the NEO NPCs with intrinsic knowledge of their surroundings, as well as interactive responses courtesy of Inworld\u2019s LLM. NVIDIA Audio2Face provides facial animations and lip synching for the two NPCs\u2019 faces in real-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld of Jade Dynasty & Unawake Also Incorporating Audio2Face Into Development Pipeline\u00a0\nPerfect World Games\u2019 World of Jade Dynasty is an upcoming Unreal Engine 5 massively multiplayer online role-playing game, and sequel to the firm\u2019s incredibly popular Jade Dynasty.\nA new video captured in-game demonstrates offline-rendered NVIDIA Audio2Face technology that generates accurate lip syncing in both Chinese and English, allowing script writers to easily add new voiced content to World of Jade Dynasty. Audio2Face can be used to easily support multi-language versions of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RealityArts Studio and Toplitz Productions\u2019 Unreal Engine 5-powered Unawake, you decide the fate of humanity amidst the turmoil of merciless wars between nightmarish creatures from Heaven and Hell. Deliver punishment or absolution to your opponents in this action-adventure as you fight them in intense first-person melee skirmishes. You are the last bastion.\nUnawake leveraged Audio2Face to create the characters\u2019 facial animations during gameplay and in high-fidelity cinematics. Watch the new Unawake video below to see Audio2Face in action, and stay tuned for the game\u2019s release later this year also featuring DLSS 3 with Frame Generation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA ACE Technologies: Building Blocks For Digital Humans and Virtual Assistants With Hippocratic AI & UneeQ\nTo showcase the new capabilities of NVIDIA digital human technologies, we\u2019ve worked with leading companies, including Hippocratic AI and UneeQ, on a series of new technology demonstrations.\nHippocraticAI has created a safety-focused, LLM-powered, task-specific Healthcare Agent.

Accelerated computing is a dramatic speedup over general-purpose computing, in every single industry.\u201d\n\nHuang spoke in front of massive images on a 40-foot tall, 8K screen the size of a tennis court to a crowd packed with CEOs and developers, AI enthusiasts and entrepreneurs, who walked together 20 minutes to the arena from the San Jose Convention Center on a dazzling spring day.\nDelivering a massive upgrade to the world\u2019s AI infrastructure, Huang introduced the NVIDIA Blackwell platform to unleash real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models.\nHuang presented NVIDIA NIM \u2014 a reference to NVIDIA inference microservices \u2014 a new way of packaging and delivering software that connects developers with hundreds of millions of GPUs to deploy custom AI of all kinds.\nAnd bringing AI into the physical world, Huang introduced Omniverse Cloud APIs to deliver advanced simulation capabilities.\n\nHuang punctuated these major announcements with powerful demos, partnerships with some of the world\u2019s largest enterprises and more than a score of announcements detailing his vision.\nGTC \u2014 which in 15 years has grown from the confines of a local hotel ballroom to the world\u2019s most important AI conference \u2014 is returning to a physical event for the first time in five years.\nThis year\u2019s has over 900 sessions \u2014 including a panel discussion on transformers moderated by Huang with the eight pioneers who first developed the technology, more than 300 exhibits and 20-plus technical workshops.\nIt\u2019s an event that\u2019s at the intersection of AI and just about everything. In a stunning opening act to the keynote, Refik Anadol, the world\u2019s leading AI artist, showed a massive real-time AI data sculpture with wave-like swirls in greens, blues, yellows and reds, crashing, twisting and unraveling across the screen.\nAs he kicked off his talk, Huang explained that the rise of multi-modal AI \u2014 able to process diverse data types handled by different models \u2014 gives AI greater adaptability and power. By increasing their parameters, these models can handle more complex analyses.\nBut this also means a significant rise in the need for computing power. And as these collaborative, multi-modal systems become more intricate \u2014 with as many as a trillion parameters \u2014 the demand for advanced computing infrastructure intensifies.\n\u201cWe need even larger models,\u201d Huang said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to train it with multimodality data, not just text on the internet, we\u2019re going to train it on texts and images, graphs and charts, and just as we learned watching TV, there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of watching video.\u201d\nThe Next Generation of Accelerated Computing\nIn short, Huang said \u201cwe need bigger GPUs.\u201d The Blackwell platform is built to meet this challenge. Huang pulled a Blackwell chip out of his pocket and held it up side-by-side with a Hopper chip, which it dwarfed.\nNamed for David Harold Blackwell \u2014 a University of California, Berkeley mathematician specializing in game theory and statistics, and the first Black scholar inducted into the National Academy of Sciences \u2014 the new architecture succeeds the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, launched two years ago.\nBlackwell delivers 2.5x its predecessor\u2019s performance in FP8 for training, per chip, and 5x with FP4 for inference. It features a fifth-generation NVLink interconnect that\u2019s twice as fast as Hopper and scales up to 576 GPUs.\nAnd the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip connects two Blackwell NVIDIA B200 Tensor Core GPUs to the NVIDIA Grace CPU over a 900GB/s ultra-low-power NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect.\nHuang held up a board with the system. \u201cThis computer is the first of its kind where this much computing fits into this small of a space,\u201d Huang said. \u201cSince this is memory coherent, they feel like it\u2019s one big happy family working on one application together.\u201d\nFor the highest AI performance, GB200-powered systems can be connected with the NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand and Spectrum-X800 Ethernet platforms, also announced today, which deliver advanced networking at speeds up to 800Gb/s.\n\n\u201cThe amount of energy we save, the amount of networking bandwidth we save, the amount of wasted time we save, will be tremendous,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe future is generative \u2026 which is why this is a brand new industry. The way we compute is fundamentally different. We created a processor for the generative AI era.\u201d\nTo scale up Blackwell, NVIDIA built a new chip called NVLink Switch. Each can connect four NVLink interconnects at 1.8 terabytes per second and eliminate traffic by doing in-network reduction.\nNVIDIA Switch and GB200 are key components of what Huang described as \u201cone giant GPU,\u201d the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system that harnesses Blackwell to offer supercharged compute for trillion-parameter models, with 720 petaflops of AI training performance and 1.4 exaflops of AI inference performance in a single rack.\n\u201cThere are only a couple, maybe three exaflop machines on the planet as we speak,\u201d Huang said of the machine, which packs 600,000 parts and weighs 3,000 pounds. \u201cAnd so this is an exaflop AI system in one single rack. Well let\u2019s take a look at the back of it.\u201d\nGoing even bigger, NVIDIA today also announced its next-generation AI supercomputer \u2014 the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powered by NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips \u2014 for processing trillion-parameter models with constant uptime for superscale generative AI training and inference workloads.\nFeaturing a new, highly efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale architecture, the new DGX SuperPOD is built with NVIDIA DG GB200 systems and provides 11.5 exaflops of AI supercomputing at FP4 precision and 240 terabytes of fast memory \u2014 scaling to more with additional racks.\n\u201cIn the future, data centers are going to be thought of \u2026 as AI factories,\u201d Huang said. \u201cTheir goal in life is to generate revenues, in this case, intelligence.\u201d\nThe industry has already embraced Blackwell.\nThe press release announcing Blackwell includes endorsements from Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Dell CEO Michael Dell, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, and Tesla and xAI CEO Elon Musk.\nBlackwell is being adopted by every major global cloud services provider,\u00a0 pioneering AI companies, system and server vendors, and regional cloud service providers and telcos all around the world.\n\u201cThe whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell,\u201d which Huang said would be the most successful launch in the company\u2019s history.\nA New Way to Create Software\nGenerative AI changes the way applications are written, Huang said.\nRather than writing software, he explained, companies will assemble AI models, give them missions, give examples of work products, review plans and intermediate results.\nThese packages \u2014 NVIDIA NIMs \u2014 are built from NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing libraries and generative AI models, Huang explained.\n\u201cHow do we build software in the future? It is unlikely that you\u2019ll write it from scratch or write a whole bunch of Python code or anything like that,\u201d Huang said. \u201cIt is very likely that you assemble a team of AIs.\u201d\nThe microservices support industry-standard APIs so they are easy to connect, work across NVIDIA\u2019s large CUDA installed base, are re-optimized for new GPUs, and are constantly scanned for security vulnerabilities and exposures.\nHuang said customers can use NIM microservices off the shelf, or NVIDIA can help build proprietary AI and copilots, teaching a model specialized skills only a specific company would know to create invaluable new services.\n\u201cThe enterprise IT industry is sitting on a goldmine,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThey have all these amazing tools (and data) that have been created over the years. If they could take that goldmine and turn it into copilots, these copilots can help us do things.\u201d\nMajor tech players are already putting it to work. Huang detailed how NVIDIA is already helping Cohesity, NetApp, SAP, ServiceNow and Snowflake build copilots and virtual assistants. And industries are stepping in, as well.\nIn telecom, Huang announced the NVIDIA 6G Research Cloud, a generative AI and Omniverse-powered platform to advance the next communications era. It\u2019s built with NVIDIA\u2019s Sionna neural radio framework, NVIDIA Aerial CUDA-accelerated radio access network and the NVIDIA Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin for 6G.\nIn semiconductor design and manufacturing, Huang announced that, in collaboration with TSMC and Synopsys, NVIDIA is bringing its breakthrough computational lithography platform, cuLitho, to production. This platform will accelerate the most compute-intensive workload in semiconductor manufacturing by 40-60x.\nHuang also announced the NVIDIA Earth Climate Digital Twin. The cloud platform \u2014 available now \u2014 enables interactive, high-resolution simulation to accelerate climate and weather prediction.\nThe greatest impact of AI will be in healthcare, Huang said, explaining that NVIDIA is already in imaging systems, in gene sequencing instruments and working with leading surgical robotics companies.\nNVIDIA is launching a new type of biology software. NVIDIA today launched more than two dozen new microservices that allow healthcare enterprises worldwide to take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI from anywhere and on any cloud. They offer advanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction and simulation.\nOmniverse Brings AI to the Physical World\nThe next wave of AI will be AI learning about the physical world, Huang said.\n\u201cWe need a simulation engine that represents the world digitally for the robot so that the robot has a gym to go learn how to be a robot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe call that virtual world Omniverse.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why NVIDIA today announced that NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available as APIs, extending the reach of the world\u2019s leading platform for creating industrial digital twin applications and workflows across the entire ecosystem of software makers.\nThe five new Omniverse Cloud application programming interfaces enable developers to easily integrate core Omniverse technologies directly into existing design and automation software applications for digital twins, or their simulation workflows for testing and validating autonomous machines like robots or self-driving vehicles.\nTo show how this works, Huang shared a demo of a robotic warehouse \u2014 using multi-camera perception and tracking \u2014 watching over workers and orchestrating robotic forklifts, which are driving autonomously with the full robotic stack running.\nHuang also announced that NVIDIA is bringing Omniverse to Apple Vision Pro, with the new Omniverse Cloud APIs letting developers stream interactive industrial digital twins into the VR headsets.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s largest industrial software makers are embracing Omniverse Cloud APIs, including Ansys, Cadence, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes for its 3DEXCITE brand, Hexagon, Microsoft, Rockwell Automation, Siemens and Trimble.\nRobotics\nEverything that moves will be robotic, Huang said. The automotive industry will be a big part of that. NVIDIA computers are already in cars, trucks, delivery bots and robotaxis.\nHuang announced that BYD, the world\u2019s largest autonomous vehicle company, has selected NVIDIA\u2019s next-generation computer for its AV, building its next-generation EV fleets on DRIVE Thor.\nTo help robots better see their environment, Huang also announced the Isaac Perceptor software development kit with state-of-the-art multi-camera visual odometry, 3D reconstruction and occupancy map, and depth perception.\nAnd to help make manipulators, or robotic arms, more adaptable, NVIDIA is announcing Isaac Manipulator \u2014 a state-of-the-art robotic arm perception, path planning and kinematic control library.\nFinally, Huang announced Project GR00T, a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots, designed to further the company\u2019s work driving breakthroughs in robotics and embodied AI.\nSupporting that effort, Huang unveiled a new computer, Jetson Thor, for humanoid robots based on the NVIDIA Thor system-on-a-chip and significant upgrades to the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform.\nIn his closing minutes, Huang brought on stage a pair of diminutive NVIDIA-powered robots from Disney Research.\n\u201cThe soul of NVIDIA \u2014 the intersection of computer graphics, physics, artificial intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all came to bear at this moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated Analytics | Cloud | Corporate | Data Center | Deep Learning | Driving | Generative AI | Hardware | Networking | Pro Graphics | Robotics | Software | Virtual RealityTags: GTC 2024 | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It corrects inaccuracies of coarse-resolution forecasts and synthesizes metrics critical to decision-making. CorrDiff is a first-of-its-kind generative AI model to deliver super-resolution, synthesize new metrics of interest to stakeholders, and learn the physics of fine-scale local weather from high-resolution datasets.\nThe Central Weather Administration of Taiwan plans to use these diffusion models to forecast more precise locations of typhoon landfall. When a typhoon warning is launched, the priority is to minimize casualties by carrying out early evacuations based on quality information generated by relevant agencies, including Taiwan\u2019s National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR). In the last decade, the death toll due to typhoons has fallen.\n\u201cTaiwan is a critical component of the global supply chain, and flooding risk analysis and evacuation preparedness are core to our mandate,\u201d said Chia-Ping Cheng, administrator of CWA.\nWith more than 136 typhoons striking the island since 2000, using Earth-2 to mitigate these impacts is key to improving the quality and resolution of disaster informatics, NCDR said.\nAnother key component of Earth-2 cloud APIs is NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122, a computing platform that enables individuals and teams to develop Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based 3D workflows and applications.\nThe Weather Company, a global leader in weather data forecasting and insights, plans to integrate its meteorological data and Weatherverse tools with Omniverse, enabling customers building digital twins to better understand and visualize the impact of actual weather conditions for the first time. The Weather Company also plans to explore the use of NVIDIA score-based generative AI for its Weatherverse services, Weather Engine solution for enterprise-level weather intelligence and new high-resolution weather modeling products.\n\u201cTo help effectively address current and future weather- and climate-related challenges, it\u2019s critical now more than ever to incorporate reliable, globally scaled real weather data and insights into digital twin environments to better analyze, plan and simulate the impacts of weather,\u201d said Sheri Bachstein, CEO of The Weather Company. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with NVIDIA for years on GPU acceleration of GRAF, our proprietary weather modeling systems, and we plan to adopt Earth-2 APIs to create higher resolution, energy-efficient simulations at a lower cost.\u201d\nOther early adopters of Earth-2 APIs include weather analytics platform companies like Spire and Meteomatics, which can build on their proprietary data sources and data assimilation to produce accurate forecasts, as well as startups Tomorrow.io, north.io and ClimaSens, which are exploring new solutions for climate tech applications.\nNVIDIA DGX Cloud-Powered Compute\r\nEarth-2 APIs use DGX Cloud to provide full-stack acceleration for climate and weather solutions. This includes optimal AI pipelines for models such as FourCastNet, GraphCast and Deep Learning Weather Prediction. It also includes GPU acceleration of numerical weather prediction models like ICON on the latest NVIDIA Grace Hopper\u2122 systems. Running on NVIDIA DGX GH200, HGX\u2122 H100 and OVX\u2122 supercomputers, Earth-2 may provide a path to simulate and visualize the global climate simulations at unprecedented speed and scale.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics and ignited the era of modern AI.

The system, the successor to DRIVE Orin, can deliver feature-rich cockpit capabilities, plus safe and secure highly automated and autonomous driving, all on a centralized platform. This next-generation AV platform will integrate the\u00a0new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, designed for transformer, LLM and generative AI workloads, which was announced during NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at GTC.\n\u201cAccelerated compute has led to transformative breakthroughs, including generative AI, which is redefining autonomy and the global transportation industry at large,\u201d said Xinzhou Wu, vice president of automotive at NVIDIA. \u201cDRIVE Orin continues to be the AI car computer of choice for today\u2019s intelligent fleets, but now we\u2019re seeing mobility leaders looking ahead to bring NVIDIA DRIVE Thor into their next-generation, AI-enabled vehicle roadmaps.\u201d\nNext-Gen AI Fleets Embrace Accelerated Compute\r\nNVIDIA DRIVE Thor is poised to revolutionize the automotive landscape, ushering in an era where generative AI defines the driving experience. At GTC, several leading EV makers are revealing their next-gen AI vehicle fleets powered by DRIVE Thor:\n\nBYD, the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle maker, is expanding its ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA from the car to the cloud. In addition to building its next-generation EV fleets on DRIVE Thor, BYD plans to use NVIDIA\u2019s AI infrastructure for cloud-based AI development and training technologies, along with the\u00a0NVIDIA Isaac\u2122 and\u00a0NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platforms to develop tools and applications for virtual factory planning and retail configurators.\nHyper, a premium luxury brand owned by GAC AION, announced it has selected DRIVE Thor for its next-generation EVs, which will begin production in 2025 with level 4 driving capabilities. Hyper is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Orin to power its flagship model Hyper GT, which features advanced level 2+ driving capabilities.\nXPENG\u00a0has also announced it will use the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor platform as the AI brain of its next-generation EV fleets. The next-gen car computer will power the EV maker\u2019s proprietary XNGP AI-assisted driving system, enabling autonomous driving and parking capabilities, driver and passenger monitoring and other functionalities.\n\nThese EV makers join\u00a0Li Auto\u00a0and\u00a0ZEEKR, which have already announced they\u2019re building their future vehicle roadmap on DRIVE Thor.\nPowering Long-Haul Trucks, Delivery Vehicles, Robotaxis\r\nBeyond passenger vehicles, DRIVE Thor caters to the diverse needs of other segments where high-performance compute and AI are essential for ensuring safe, secure driving operations, including trucking, robotaxis, goods delivery vehicles and more.\nA number of these mobility providers are leading the charge at GTC, including:\n\nNuro, which develops level 4 autonomous driving technology for commercial and consumer vehicles, has selected DRIVE Thor to power the Nuro Driver\u2122, an integrated autonomous driving system consisting of Nuro\u2019s proprietary AI-first software and sensors paired with NVIDIA automotive-grade compute and networking hardware. The system will begin testing later this year.\nPlus, a global provider of autonomous driving software solutions, announced that future generations of its level 4 solution, SuperDrive\u2122, will run on the automotive-grade, safety-compliant DRIVE Thor centralized computer. Plus will leverage the compute performance of DRIVE Thor within its autonomous driving system to understand the world around the truck and make safe driving decisions.\nWaabi, which is building AI for self-driving, is leveraging DRIVE Thor to deliver the first generative AI-powered autonomous trucking solution to market. The company plans to integrate DRIVE Thor in its Waabi Driver to power safe and reliable autonomous trucks at scale.\nWeRide, in cooperation with tier 1 partner\u00a0Lenovo Vehicle Computing, is creating several level 4 autonomous driving solutions for commercial applications built on DRIVE Thor. Integrated within Lenovo\u2019s first autonomous driving domain controller AD1, this solution will be used for a wide range of urban-centered use cases, where functional safety, redundant safety design, fusion and scalability are a must.\n\nThe Great and Powerful DRIVE Thor\r\nSlated for production vehicles as early as next year, DRIVE Thor will harness the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, which features a generative AI engine and other cutting-edge capabilities, and wields 1,000 teraflops of performance to help ensure safe and secure autonomous machines.\nTo learn the latest on NVIDIA DRIVE, watch NVIDIA\u2019s\u00a0GTC keynote.\u00a0Register for GTC\u00a0to attend sessions from NVIDIA and transportation industry leaders through March 21.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

And NVIDIA NIM\u00a0 \u2014 a set of inference microservices that includes inferencing engines like TensorRT-LLM \u2014 makes it easier than ever for businesses to deploy NVIDIA\u2019s inference platform.\n\nRaising the Bar in Generative AI\nTensorRT-LLM running on NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs \u2014 the latest, memory-enhanced Hopper GPUs \u2014 delivered the fastest performance running inference in MLPerf\u2019s biggest test of generative AI to date.\nThe new benchmark uses the largest version of Llama 2, a state-of-the-art large language model packing 70 billion parameters. The model is more than 10x larger than the GPT-J LLM first used in the September benchmarks.\nThe memory-enhanced H200 GPUs, in their MLPerf debut, used TensorRT-LLM to produce up to 31,000 tokens/second, a record on MLPerf\u2019s Llama 2 benchmark.\nThe H200 GPU results include up to 14% gains from a custom thermal solution. It\u2019s one example of innovations beyond standard air cooling that systems builders are applying to their NVIDIA MGX designs to take the performance of Hopper GPUs to new heights.\n\nMemory Boost for NVIDIA Hopper GPUs\nNVIDIA is sampling H200 GPUs to customers today and shipping in the second quarter. They\u2019ll be available soon from nearly 20 leading system builders and cloud service providers.\nH200 GPUs pack 141GB of HBM3e running at 4.8TB/s. That\u2019s 76% more memory flying 43% faster compared to H100 GPUs. These accelerators plug into the same boards and systems and use the same software as H100 GPUs.\nWith HBM3e memory, a single H200 GPU can run an entire Llama 2 70B model with the highest throughput, simplifying and speeding inference.\nGH200 Packs Even More Memory\nEven more memory \u2014 up to 624GB of fast memory, including 144GB of HBM3e \u2014 is packed in NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, which combine on one module a Hopper architecture GPU and a power-efficient NVIDIA Grace CPU. NVIDIA accelerators are the first to use HBM3e memory technology.\nWith nearly 5 TB/second memory bandwidth, GH200 Superchips delivered standout performance, including on memory-intensive MLPerf tests such as recommender systems.\nSweeping Every MLPerf Test\nOn a per-accelerator basis, Hopper GPUs swept every test of AI inference in the latest round of the MLPerf industry benchmarks.\nIn addition, NVIDIA Jetson Orin remains at the forefront in MLPerf\u2019s edge category. In the last two inference rounds, Orin ran the most diverse set of models in the category, including GPT-J and Stable Diffusion XL.\nThe MLPerf benchmarks cover today\u2019s most popular AI workloads and scenarios, including generative AI, recommendation systems, natural language processing, speech and computer vision. NVIDIA was the only company to submit results on every workload in the latest round and every round since MLPerf\u2019s data center inference benchmarks began in October 2020.\nContinued performance gains translate into lower costs for inference, a large and growing part of the daily work for the millions of NVIDIA GPUs deployed worldwide.\nAdvancing What\u2019s Possible\nPushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible, NVIDIA demonstrated three innovative techniques in a special section of the benchmarks called the open division, created for testing advanced AI methods.\nNVIDIA engineers used a technique called structured sparsity \u2014 a way of reducing calculations, first introduced with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs \u2014 to deliver up to 33% speedups on inference with Llama 2.\nA second open division test found inference speedups of up to 40% using pruning, a way of simplifying an AI model \u2014 in this case, an LLM \u2014 to increase inference throughput.\nFinally, an optimization called DeepCache reduced the math required for inference with the Stable Diffusion XL model, accelerating performance by a whopping 74%.\nAll these results were run on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nA Trusted Source for Users\nMLPerf\u2019s tests are transparent and objective, so users can rely on the results to make informed buying decisions.\nNVIDIA\u2019s partners participate in MLPerf because they know it\u2019s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI systems and services. Partners submitting results on the NVIDIA AI platform in this round included ASUS, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure, Oracle, QCT, Supermicro, VMware (recently acquired by Broadcom) and Wiwynn.\nAll the software NVIDIA used in the tests is available in the MLPerf repository. These optimizations are continuously folded into containers available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s software hub for GPU applications, as well as NVIDIA AI Enterprise \u2014 a secure, supported platform that includes NIM inference microservices.\nThe Next Big Thing\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use cases, model sizes and datasets for generative AI continue to expand. That\u2019s why MLPerf continues to evolve, adding real-world tests with popular models like Llama 2 70B and Stable Diffusion XL.\nKeeping pace with the explosion in LLM model sizes, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced last week at GTC that the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs will deliver new levels of performance required for the multitrillion-parameter AI models.\nInference for large language models is difficult, requiring both expertise and the full-stack architecture NVIDIA demonstrated on MLPerf with Hopper architecture GPUs and TensorRT-LLM. There\u2019s much more to come.\nLearn more about MLPerf benchmarks and the technical details of this inference round.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | GPU | Hardware | Inference | Machine Learning | NGC | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA NIM | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The designer toggles through paint and trim options and even enters the vehicle \u2014 leveraging the power of spatial computing by blending 3D photorealistic environments with the physical world.\n\nBringing the Power of RTX Enterprise Cloud Rendering to Spatial Computing\nSpatial computing has emerged as a powerful technology for delivering immersive experiences and seamless interactions between people, products, processes and physical spaces. Industrial enterprise use cases require incredibly high-resolution displays and powerful sensors operating at high frame rates to make manufacturing experiences true to reality.\nThis new Omniverse-based workflow combines Apple Vision Pro groundbreaking high-resolution displays with NVIDIA\u2019s powerful RTX cloud rendering to deliver spatial computing experiences with just the device and an internet connection.\nThis cloud-based approach allows real-time physically based renderings to be streamed seamlessly to Apple Vision Pro, delivering high-fidelity visuals without compromising details of the massive, engineering fidelity datasets.\n\u201cThe breakthrough ultra-high-resolution displays of Apple Vision Pro, combined with photorealistic rendering of OpenUSD content streamed from NVIDIA accelerated computing, unlocks an incredible opportunity for the advancement of immersive experiences,\u201d said Mike Rockwell, vice president of the Vision Products Group at Apple. \u201cSpatial computing will redefine how designers and developers build captivating digital content, driving a new era of creativity and engagement.\u201d\n\u201cApple Vision Pro is the first untethered device which allows for enterprise customers to realize their work without compromise,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of simulation at NVIDIA. \u201cWe look forward to our customers having access to these amazing tools.\u201d\nThe workflow also introduces hybrid rendering, a groundbreaking technique that combines local and remote rendering on the device. Users can render fully interactive experiences in a single application from Apple\u2019s native SwiftUI and Reality Kit with the Omniverse RTX Renderer streaming from GDN.\nNVIDIA GDN, available in over 130 countries, taps NVIDIA\u2019s global cloud-to-edge streaming infrastructure to deliver smooth, high-fidelity, interactive experiences. By moving heavy compute tasks to GDN, users can tackle the most demanding rendering use cases, no matter the size or complexity of the dataset.\nEnhancing Spatial Computing Workloads Across Use Cases\nThe Omniverse-based workflow showed potential for a wide range of use cases. For example, designers could use the technology to see their 3D data in full fidelity, with no loss in quality or model decimation. This means designers can interact with trustworthy simulations that look and behave like the real physical product. This also opens new channels and opportunities for e-commerce experiences.\nIn industrial settings, factory planners can view and interact with their full engineering factory datasets, letting them optimize their workflows and identify potential bottlenecks.\nFor developers and independent software vendors, NVIDIA is building the capabilities that would allow them to use the native tools on Apple Vision Pro to seamlessly interact with existing data in their applications.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse and GDN, and sign up to get notified\u00a0about NVIDIA Omniverse streaming to Apple Vision Pro.\n\n\nCategories: Pro Graphics | Virtual RealityTags: 3D | Digital Twin | GTC 2024 | Omniverse | Rendering | Universal Scene Description | Virtual Reality \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A typical mask set for a chip \u2014 a key step in its production \u2014 could take 30 million or more hours of CPU compute time, necessitating large data centers within semiconductor foundries. With accelerated computing, 350 NVIDIA H100 systems can now replace 40,000 CPU systems, accelerating production time, while reducing costs, space and power.\n\u201cOur work with NVIDIA to integrate GPU-accelerated computing in the TSMC workflow has resulted in great leaps in performance, dramatic throughput improvement, shortened cycle time and reduced power requirements,\u201d said Dr. C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC. \u201cWe are moving NVIDIA cuLitho into production at TSMC, leveraging this computational lithography technology to drive a critical component of semiconductor scaling.\u201d\nSince its introduction last year, cuLitho has enabled TSMC to open new opportunities for innovative patterning technologies. In testing cuLitho on shared workflows, the companies jointly realized a 45x speedup of curvilinear flows and a nearly 60x improvement on more traditional Manhattan-style flows. These two types of flows differ \u2014 with curvilinear the mask shapes are represented by curves, while Manhattan mask shapes are constrained to be either horizontal or vertical.\n\u201cFor more than two decades Synopsys Proteus mask synthesis software products have been the production-proven choice for accelerating computational lithography \u2014 the most demanding workload in semiconductor manufacturing,\u201d said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys. \u201cWith the move to advanced nodes, computational lithography has dramatically increased in complexity and compute cost. Our collaboration with TSMC and NVIDIA is critical to enabling angstrom-level scaling as we pioneer advanced technologies to reduce turnaround time by orders of magnitude through the power of accelerated computing.\u201d\nSynopsys is the pioneer in delivering advanced techniques for accelerating the performance of computational lithography. Synopsys\u2019 Proteus\u2122 optical proximity correction software running on the NVIDIA cuLitho software library significantly speeds computational workloads compared to current CPU-based methods. With Proteus mask synthesis products, manufacturers like TSMC can achieve exceptional precision, efficiency and speed in proximity correction, model building for correction, and analyzing proximity effects on corrected and uncorrected IC layout patterns, revolutionizing the chip fabrication process.\nBreakthrough Generative AI Support for Computational Lithography\r\nNVIDIA has developed algorithms to apply generative AI to further enhance the value of the cuLitho platform. The new generative AI workflow delivers an additional 2x speedup on top of the accelerated processes enabled through cuLitho. The application of generative AI enables creation of a near-perfect inverse mask or inverse solution to account for diffraction of light. The final mask is then derived by traditional and physically rigorous methods, speeding up the overall optical proximity correction (OPC) process by a factor of two.\nMany changes in the fab process currently necessitate a revision in OPC, driving up the amount of compute required and creating bottlenecks in the fab development cycle. These costs and bottlenecks are alleviated with the accelerated computing cuLitho provides and generative AI, enabling fabs to allocate available compute capacity and engineering bandwidth to design more novel solutions in development of new technologies for 2nm and beyond.\nTo learn more, watch Huang\u2019s GTC keynote.

The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology, leading countless tech companies to pivot their businesses toward the high-growth sector.\nAs a result, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which will see it hit just under $2 trillion. The industry is expanding at a rapid pace, making it one of the best places to make a long-term investment.\nTwo stocks currently leading the way in AI are Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.52%) and Nvidia (NVDA -1.69%), with their shares recently up 149% and 257% respectively year over year. As prominent chipmakers, these companies supply the hardware necessary to train and run AI models. Their stocks could soar further in the coming years as the market develops.\nSo, let's compare these companies' businesses and determine whether AMD or Nvidia is the better AI stock this March.\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nAMD was slightly overshadowed by Nvidia's head start in AI chips last year, as Nvidia seized an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs). \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the massive potential of the industry suggests AMD won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still see major gains from AI. So, despite spending years prioritizing its position in central processing units (CPUs), AMD has shifted its focus to developing its GPU technology and expanding in the budding AI market.\nLast December, the company unveiled its MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and has already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players.\n\nIn November 2023, Microsoft announced that Azure would become the first cloud platform to use AMD's MI300X to optimize AI capabilities. Microsoft has a close partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, making the company a powerful ally for AMD. An agreement with Meta -- which aims to use the new chips as well -- also helps AMD's future in AI look bright.\nMoreover, AMD isn't banking solely on stealing market share from Nvidia in GPUs. AMD seeks to lead its own space within AI by investing in AI-powered PCs. According to research firm IDC, PC shipments are projected to see a major boost this year, with AI integration serving as a key catalyst. And a Canalys report predicts that 60% of all PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-enabled. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\nNvidia captivated Wall Street over the last year as its chips became the gold standard for AI developers everywhere.\nSoaring demand for AI GPUs enabled Nvidia's revenue to skyrocket. In the fourth quarter of 2024 (ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Meanwhile, operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The monster growth was primarily from a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting increased chip sales.\nIn addition to soaring earnings, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion. \n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from its competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed it further ahead with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has a powerful position in AI that looks unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. Its market cap surpassed $2 trillion this year thanks to its massive success in AI. AMD's market cap is significantly lower at about $327 billion. However, that could mean AMD has more room to run over the long term as the company is still in the early stages of its AI journey. \nIs AMD or Nvidia the better AI stock?\nAI can potentially boost countless industries, from cloud computing to consumer products, autonomous vehicles, video games, and more. With so many sectors prioritizing generative technology, chip demand is only likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result, AMD and Nvidia are two exciting options to invest in AI. However, earnings per share (EPS) estimates indicate AMD might have more growth potential in the near term.\n\nData by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows AMD's earnings could hit just over $7 per share in the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's may reach $34 per share. On the surface, Nvidia looks like the clear winner. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios (AMD's 56 and Nvidia's 35) yields stock prices of $403 for AMD and $1,197 for Nvidia. \nConsidering their current positions, these projections would see AMD's stock rise 99% and Nvidia's 41% by fiscal 2026.\nAlongside heavy investment in AI and potentially more room to run, AMD is the better AI stock over Nvidia and a screaming buy this month.\n\n\n\nDani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Featuring day-one support for DLSS 3, DLAA and Reflex, you\u2019ll want to download and install our new driver for the definitive experience when using these technologies in the critically acclaimed game.\nOur latest driver Game Ready Driver also includes support for the latest DLSS 3.5 update for Portal with RTX, which introduces DLSS Ray Reconstruction and NVIDIA RTX IO. Plus, there\u2019s support for 11 G-SYNC Compatible gaming displays, and 2 new Optimal Settings, enabling you to jump into the latest games with a great performance and image quality, without the need to manually tweak settings.\nDownload and install the new GeForce Game Ready Driver from the Drivers tab of the NVIDIA app, GeForce Experience or GeForce.com, and read on to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\nJoin Aloy as she braves the distant lands of Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, the critically-acclaimed sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn. Launching March 21st, the Complete Edition also includes Burning Shores, the story expansion that picks up after the conclusion of the main game, along with bonus content.\nExplore distant lands, fight bigger and more awe-inspiring machines, and encounter astonishing new tribes as you return to the far-future, post-apocalyptic world of Horizon. The land is dying. Vicious storms and an unstoppable blight ravage the scattered remnants of humanity, while fearsome new machines prowl their borders. Life on Earth is hurtling towards another extinction, and no one knows why.\nIt's up to Aloy to uncover the secrets behind these threats and restore order and balance to the world. Along the way, she must reunite with old friends, forge alliances with warring new factions and unravel the legacy of the ancient past \u2013 all the while trying to stay one step ahead of a seemingly undefeatable new enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo 4K screenshots from the PC release of Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition is released, GeForce RTX gamers can activate DLSS 3 from day-one to multiply their performance, while those with fast enough frame rates can use DLAA to maximize their image quality. And to make gameplay even more responsive, players can enable Reflex to reduce system latency.\u00a0\nWithout DLSS Super Resolution or Frame Generation, GeForce RTX 4080 owners can use the Very High graphics preset at 4K and play at 60 FPS, per Sony\u2019s official Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition system requirements.

(NASDAQ:MU) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), suggesting that their stock prices have the potential to rise further.\nWhat Happened: In a post on Thursday, Cramer highlighted Micron\u2019s upward trajectory and recommended buying Nvidia and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) as well.\nCramer\u2019s comments came amid a positive outlook for several tech stocks heading into the week. His endorsement of Nvidia also follows his recent spotlight on the company\u2019s non-technical partners, which could benefit from Nvidia\u2019s advanced AI technology.\n\nI think Micron can go higher still, I also think that this is still one more reason, of course, to buy Nvidia (and Broadcom)\u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) March 21, 2024\n\nCramer also added that Micron has an important role in the AI space. He emphasized that the \u201chot stuff\u201d at Micron, which is currently on allocation, is their high bandwidth business. This segment is vital for AI accelerators, such as those used in Nvidia\u2019s Tensor Core H 200 and Blackwell.\n\t\t\n\n\nSee Also: Andrew Tate Says He Made $85M On Last DeFi Bull Run: \u2018Meme Coin That\u2019s Great..But Each Bull Run There..Innovating Blockchain Coins\u2019\n\nOn Micron, let's be clear, the hot stuff that i am talking about at Micron that is on ALLOCATION is the high bandwidth business that is essential in AI accelerators like NVDA Tensor Core H 200 and Blackwell \u2026\u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) March 21, 2024\n\nWhy It Matters: This came after Micron last month initiated large-scale production of its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors, intended for integration into Nvidia\u2019s newest artificial intelligence chip. Nvidia intends to incorporate the chip into its upcoming H200 graphic processing units, slated to commence shipments in the second quarter. These units are anticipated to surpass the current H100 chip, which has driven significant revenue growth for the chip designer.\nCramer\u2019s bullish stance on Micron aligns with the broader market anticipation ahead of the company\u2019s earnings report. U.S. stock futures were trading higher with investors eyeing Micron among other stocks for potential gains.\nMoreover, Cramer\u2019s positive sentiment towards Nvidia is backed by his identification of several non-tech partners that stand to gain from Nvidia\u2019s AI advancements. As reported, these partners, which include companies like Getty Images Holdings, could see significant benefits from their collaborations with Nvidia. \n\t\t\n\n\nRead Next: Whopping $33.8 Million Worth Of Dogecoin Shifted To Robinhood \u2014 And People Suspect This Person Could Be Behind It\nImage via Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n            Engineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by \nPooja Rajkumari\n\n\n\n\n            The GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.\n            Learn more.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSHARE THIS POST\n\n\n\n\n\n FACEBOOK\n\n\n\n\n TWITTER\n\n\n\n\n EMAIL\n\n\n\n\n COPY LINK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNVIDIA NewsMORE  \n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform Paves Way for Age of AI ReasoningGlobeNewswire 22m \n\n\n\nNVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Library Accelerates and Scales AI Reasoning ModelsGlobeNewswire 39m \n\n\n\nNvidia GTC 2025: Rubin, reasoning, robotics and moreSeeking Alpha 1h \n\n\n\nGeneral Motors and NVIDIA Collaborate on AI for Next-Generation Vehicle Experience and ManufacturingGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nNVIDIA and Telecom Industry Leaders to Develop AI-Native Wireless Networks for 6GGlobeNewswire 1h \n\n\n\nForesight Autonomous announces integration of NVIDIA Jetson OrinTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NVDA): New Buy Recommendation for This Technology GiantTipRanks 8h \n\n\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Expected to Reveal New Chips at GTC Today as AI Demands Bigger GPUsTipRanks 9h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tStart Trading Futures\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n\n\n\n\nAVGO\n\n\n\n189.71\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-4.79 (-2.46%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t02:56:38 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time AVGO charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGETY\n\n\n\n2.24\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t0.09 (3.95%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t02:52:44 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time GETY charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMU\n\n\n\n103.09\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-0.02 (-0.02%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t02:56:29 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time MU charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA\n\n\n\n117.29\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-2.24 (-1.87%)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t02:56:37 PM\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nGet real-time NVDA charts here >>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tMORE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFind News\n\t\t\t\tNews\n\n\n\n\n\nGO\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n            See also:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                - Explore more categories\n            \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Despite being fallible just like every other investor, the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as he's affably known, has overseen a monstrous aggregate gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 4,995,105%, as of the closing bell on March 15. Extensive books have been written detailing the \"recipe\" Buffett has used to vastly outperform the benchmark S&P 500. Typically, this means seeking out brand-name businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and trusted management teams.   Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.   But you might be surprised to learn that three of the 45 stocks Buffett and his investment team are currently holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $366 billion portfolio are cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. According to estimates from PwC, AI solutions -- i.e., software and systems handling tasks that would normally be assigned to humans -- can add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by the end of the decade. As of March 15, 44% ($159 billion) of the $366 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was being put to work in three widely owned AI stocks -- and no, Nvidia isn't one of them. Apple: $156,317,767,200 (42.8% of invested assets) The lion's share of Buffett's \"AI holdings\" can be traced to the largest position in Berkshire's investment portfolio: tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple accounts for more than 4 times the weighting of Bank America, which is Berkshire's second-largest holding (10% of invested assets).  Although Apple isn't developing the infrastructure that's made Nvidia the foundation of the AI movement, AI solutions are embedded in virtually all of its products and are critical to the company's long-term growth strategy. Apple uses AI to improve the autocorrect and word suggestion capabilities of its U.S. market-share-leading iPhone, and recently launched its mixed-reality Vision Pro headset, which incorporates eye- and hand-tracking using AI. While artificial intelligence solutions are staples in Apple's products, Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, undoubtedly purchased shares of Apple for different reasons. One of the primary lures of Apple is its exceptional customer loyalty. It's one of the most well-known and valuable global brands. Sustaining a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market means consumers eagerly await the annual launch of a new iPhone.   Story Continues The Oracle of Omaha is likely also enamored with Apple's top-notch management team. In addition to constantly improving the functionality of iPhone and developing the Apple Watch, Apple CEO Tim Cook is spearheading a transformation that's seen his company become more services oriented. Emphasizing subscription services should steadily improve Apple's margins, smooth out the sales fluctuations observed during the tail end of major iPhone upgrade cycles, and encourage consumers to stay within Apple's ecosystem of products and services.The other reason Buffett is a big fan of Apple is the company's unmatched capital-return program. Apple returned just a hair over $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders last year, and has repurchased a jaw-dropping $651 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. This means Berkshire is steadily becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to lift a finger.Amazon: $1,744,200,000 (0.5% of invested assets)A second artificial intelligence stock you'll find nestled in Warren Buffett's $366 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway is none other than e-commerce kingpin Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).Amazon is utilizing AI in more ways than can be counted here. Some examples include analyzing what you're purchasing and putting in your shopping cart to recommend new products, as well as allowing its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to build applications using generative AI to tailor advertisements and improve customer interactions.Additionally, Amazon is developing its own graphics processing units (GPUs) for its in-house data centers that could complement, or even replace, the GPUs from Nvidia that have taken the AI movement by storm.While most people are familiar with Amazon because of its overwhelmingly dominant online marketplace, it's actually the company's ancillary operating segments that do a majority of the heavy lifting. Arguably no segment is more important than AWS.Last year, AWS accounted for about a sixth of Amazon's net sales, but was responsible for two-thirds of the company's operating income. Enterprise cloud spending still appears to be in its relatively early innings of expansion, which suggests AWS has many years of double-digit sales growth ahead. As of September 2023, AWS led all other cloud infrastructure service platforms with a 31% share of global spend.Interestingly enough, Amazon is fairly inexpensive, too. Shares can be scooped up right now for a greater than 40% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the trailing-five-year period. While this may not be the traditional \"value stock\" Buffett looks for, it's certainly something that has piqued the interest of one or both of his top investment aides.

Snowflake: $961,500,271 (0.3% of invested assets)The third AI stock that, collectively with Apple and Amazon, accounts for approximately 44% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets is cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW). This is another Berkshire holding that was almost certainly added because of the influence of Weschler or Combs.Snowflake really put itself on the map of AI investors this past summer when it announced a collaboration with Nvidia that would allow Snowflake accounts to utilize Nvidia's high-powered GPUs. Snowflake is also making generative AI solutions available to its customers to assist with training, customizing, and deploying large language models.What's really drawn investors to Snowflake since it went public in September 2020 is its well defined competitive advantages. For instance, it can be challenging for users of competing cloud infrastructure service platforms to share information. Since Snowflake built its infrastructure atop the most popular cloud platforms, sharing and transferring data is seamless.Customers also seem to appreciate Snowflake's transparent pricing policy. Instead of utilizing subscription pricing like many of its peers, Snowflake has opted to charge users based on how much data they store and how many Snowflake Compute Credits they use.But in spite of these well-defined competitive edges, justifying Snowflake's premium valuation has been challenging. Its days of triple-digit sales growth are long gone. With businesses still cautious about the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, Snowflake's annual sales growth is expected to slow to approximately 22% in the current fiscal year. At north of 160 times estimated earnings per share, investors might be wise to keep their distance and allow Snowflake to grow into its current valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s no secret that for technology companies to stay on top, they spend funds abundantly on research and development. However, in the world of AI, there\u2019s nothing more important than computing power. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been selling picks and shovels to miners during the AI gold rush.\nFiguring out which AI stocks to buy can be difficult, as many tech giant AI projects are still in development. Investors can use statistics to predict which companies have the brightest future in the AI sector. One of the best ways to do this is by determining how much companies are investing in AI infrastructure. \nThat\u2019s because it takes an exorbitant amount of processing power to develop AI large language models. Let\u2019s look at how these AI investments are coming along by discussing three of the biggest buyers of Nvidia GPUs.\nStocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\nWith its recent rebrand combining Bing AI and Copilot, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has gone all in on its AI products. Yet the process of trying to create the best large language model doesn\u2019t just mean investing millions into open AI. From Microsoft, the two-pronged approach of large language models and its Azure cloud services have resulted in the company having to buy over 150,000 units of Nvidia GPUs.\nSo far, thanks to a large amount of cash invested, Microsoft has seen tremendous expansion in valuation and customer base. Furthermore, its clear dedication to the AI space means that it will likely continue to be one of the top customers of GPUs in the years to come as it expands its offerings to more and more businesses.\nFurthermore, Nvidia GPUs serve as pistons in an engine for the AI race. Microsoft\u2019s investments mean it has more than enough to continue to power ahead against its competition. Therefore, just from its investments alone, Microsoft looks like one of the best stocks to buy in the GPU race.\nMeta Platforms (META)\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\nSocial media master Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), has predicted a total business expense range of $94-99 billion in 2024. Unsurprisingly, a significant portion of these expenses come from its commitment to computing expansion. The question is, however, what does a primarily social media service company have to gain from AI investing?\nThe answer: Meta is one of the leading companies pursuing artificial general intelligence. This superior type of AI exceeds many of the functions of regular AI, which eats up far more computer processing. However, current predictions vary widely on what the actual applications of artificial general intelligence will be.\u00a0\nEven so, the first company to achieve this leap in AI technology will likely come to dominate the market. For investors, keeping a close eye on GPU usage and procurement directly impacts the speed of AGI development. Of course, such foresight is critical when determining which stocks to buy in the AGI race.\nStocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN)\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\nBetween Amazon Web Services and new plays into mobile edge computing, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested heavily to expand its AI potential. As each year goes by, it becomes clearer and clearer that Amazon\u2019s original business model of warehousing and shipping isn\u2019t the true money maker. In fact, Amazon aims to be the company through which all cloud and edge computing is done in the AI future.\nTo achieve this, the company has needed to buy nearly 50,000 GPUs, which puts it in the top five. The difference, however, lies in the way that Amazon provides these web services. To accelerate cloud computing, Amazon combines these GPUs into highly intricate supercomputing cluster networks.\nThis approach has led to AWS cloud computing networks becoming increasingly desirable to companies outsourcing their data processing needs. Thus, it\u2019s likely Amazon will continue to buy GPUs.

Most of Nvidia's market capitalization has been added in the last 12 months alone, thanks entirely to its data center chips designed to process artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. CEO Jensen Huang is often referred to as the \"Godfather of AI\" by Wall Street analysts, and now he's spreading his company's good fortune by investing in other AI stocks.   Image source: Getty Images.   The five AI stocks Nvidia owns shares in In its first-ever 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, Nvidia revealed it purchased five AI stocks in the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31): Arm Holdings, which helps the world's largest semiconductor companies design and develop their advanced computing chips. Nano-X Imaging, which uses AI to improve the efficiency of medical imaging to help patients achieve better outcomes. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which is using AI to reshape drug discovery. Tusimple Holdings, which develops advanced autonomous self-driving technologies for the trucking industry. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which develops voice recognition and conversational AI technologies.   Arm Holdings attracted the largest investment, with Nvidia's position worth over $147.3 million at the end of last year. However, Arm is only second-best in the group of five stocks when it comes to stock price performance in 2024, with a 104% gain so far. SoundHound AI is winning that race. Its stock is up an eye-watering 180% year-to-date, valuing the company at $1.5 billion. Nvidia's stake is relatively small with a value of just $10.1 million at SoundHound's current stock price ($5.83), but it hasn't stopped the buying frenzy among investors. So is it too late to follow Nvidia's lead? Conversational AI is a game changer for businesses While many popular generative AI applications focus on ingesting text prompts to create text, image, and video content, SoundHound has developed conversational AI that understands voice and responds in kind. SoundHound's customer list includes some of the largest companies in the hospitality and automotive industries. Restaurant chains use conversational AI to take customer orders -- both in-store and in the drive-thru -- and also handle incoming phone queries, which reduces the workload on employees. Krispy Kreme and Jersey Mike's are just two of many SoundHound customers in that space.   Story Continues Car giants like Mercedes Benz and Stellantis (home to Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and other brands) use SoundHound's technology to create in-car virtual assistants capable of understanding each vehicle's functionality and answering a wide range of general queries.In early February, SoundHound took those products to the next level with its \"Dynamic Interaction With Generative AI\" technology. It's a brand-new interface that responds to voice and touch prompts with audiovisual content, rather than just voice. It can decide when it's appropriate to include maps, internet search results, images, and videos in its responses to enhance the user experience.SoundHound AI experienced a surge in demand in 2023SoundHound only generated $45.9 million in revenue in 2023, although it was an impressive 47% increase compared to 2022.The real story is the company's order backlog, which hit $661 million by the end of the year. That was double the backlog it had at the same time in 2022. Therefore, even though SoundHound's revenue is still relatively light, that backlog could translate to substantial growth in the years ahead.There are signs of that in SoundHound's 2024 forecast. It expects to deliver $70 million in revenue for the year, which would see growth accelerate to 49%.Unfortunately, there is one negative factor investors need to be wary of. SoundHound lost $88.9 million on the bottom line in 2023, and while it isn't unusual for small tech enterprises to lose money while they scale up, this company only has $99.5 million in cash on hand, so it can't afford a repeat of last year.SoundHound will most likely need a cash infusion within the next couple of years. If it completes an equity offering, that will dilute existing investors and potentially dent its stock price.Is it too late to follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock?SoundHound AI stock soared by more than 60% on Feb. 15, when investors first learned of Nvidia's investment in the company. It jumped by a further 46% on Feb. 26, when Nvidia announced an expansion of its partnership with ServiceNow to improve the telecommunications industry using generative AI.Together, Nvidia and ServiceNow will build generative AI solutions to elevate customer care and service assurance. While this deal makes no mention of SoundHound, conversational AI is the perfect technology to help service providers automate phone calls and resolve customer queries far more efficiently.Considering Nvidia's recent investment in SoundHound stock, investors are speculating this deal could benefit the conversational AI specialist down the line. Plus, in the fourth quarter of last year, SoundHound said it received a \"notable, first-of-its-kind revenue contribution from a preeminent AI chip company.\" No specifics are provided, but the timing certainly lines up nicely with Nvidia's investment in SoundHound.For now, SoundHound AI stock might simply be a speculative bet on the AI industry until it's in a more predictable financial position. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as investors understand it will probably carry more volatility than the average stock.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia's high-end GPUs are used to process complex AI tasks in data centers, while Microsoft is a leading investor in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been integrating OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into its cloud, search, and productivity tools.\nOver the past three years, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 600% while Microsoft's stock has rallied just over 70%. Nvidia was clearly the better play on the booming AI market, but will it continue to outperform Microsoft over the next few years?\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia remains the ultimate AI play\nIn fiscal 2024, which ended this January, Nvidia's revenue surged 126% to $60.9 billion as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 288%. That marked a dizzying acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% decline in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2023.\nThe company struggled in fiscal 2023 as the PC market's post-pandemic slowdown throttled its sales of gaming GPUs. The crypto market's meltdown exacerbated that pressure as disillusioned miners flooded the market with secondhand GPUs.\nThe macro headwinds also drove some companies to rein in their purchases of new data center GPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in fiscal 2024, the soaring popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms sparked a buying frenzy in its data center GPUs. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC and crypto markets recovered.\nNvidia generated 78% of its revenue from its data center GPUs in fiscal 2024, and the market's demand is still outstripping its supply by a wide margin. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect its revenue to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 39%. Those growth rates are astonishing, but its stock still doesn't look terribly expensive at 39 times forward earnings.\nNvidia seems like a simple way to profit from the growth of the generative AI market, which Fortune Business Insights estimates will have a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. But investors shouldn't overlook its longer-term challenges.\nAMD is rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, its top cloud customers are developing their own first-party chips, and start-ups like Groq are creating faster dedicated chips to process natural language queries. Chinese chipmakers could also launch alternative AI chips to counter the export curbs on Nvidia's top-tier chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is a more balanced play on the AI market\nMicrosoft is more diversified. Its sprawling ecosystem houses its Windows operating system, Office productivity software, Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Bing search engine, Xbox gaming business, and Surface hardware devices.\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last June), Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS both rose 7% as the expansion of its cloud business -- which includes Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 -- offset the slower growth of its Windows, Surface, and Xbox divisions, which all faced fierce headwinds as the PC and gaming markets cooled off in a post-pandemic world.\n\nBut for fiscal 2024, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 15% and 19%, respectively, as the growth of its cloud business accelerates again. That acceleration was driven by the integration of OpenAI's generative AI tools directly into Microsoft's cloud-based services.\nAs result, Microsoft's Azure -- the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform -- has been growing faster than the market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as its third-place competitor, Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to have a CAGR of 14% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 16%. Those estimates assume its cloud business will continue to expand, the PC market will recover, and its acquisition of Activision Blizzard will significantly strengthen its Xbox gaming division.\nThose growth rates suggest Microsoft is still a sound way to profit from the expansion of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets -- but its stock isn't cheap at 30 times next year's earnings. If Microsoft's cloud business loses its momentum or antitrust regulators challenge its investments in OpenAI, its valuations could decline and drive its stock lower.\nThe better AI play: Nvidia\nNvidia and Microsoft are both promising plays on the AI market, but Nvidia's simpler business model, higher growth rates, and more reasonable valuations make it the better buy. Nvidia's investors should keep an eye on the competitive and regulatory headwinds, but it could be years before any of those challenges limit its growth.\nUntil then, Nvidia will continue to sell the market's best shovels for the AI gold rush -- and it could even eclipse Microsoft's market cap in just a few years.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

An investor who put $10,000 into Nvidia stock a decade ago and held on would be sitting on a position worth more than $1.8 million right now and more than $1.9 million with dividends reinvested.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nBut can Nvidia replicate this feat and help new investors become millionaires if they start with a $10,000 investment?\nIs it realistic to expect such massive gains from Nvidia again?\nNvidia has grown by leaps and bounds over the past decade, and now, with a market cap of just over $2.25 trillion, it's the third-largest company in the world. So for Nvidia to grow by 100 times from here, its market cap would have to exceed $200 trillion. That looks absurd: Last year, the entire global gross domestic product (GDP) was an estimated $105 trillion, up just 5% from 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's market cap, therefore, is equivalent to about 2% of the global GDP. If it maintained that proportion over the long haul, it would be worth $200 trillion when the world economy had grown to an almost incomprehensibly large $10 quadrillion. That may not happen in our lifetime -- global GDP has grown by between 2% and 5% a year since 1980 in most years, except during the 2008-2009 recession and at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.\nAssuming the global economy grows at an optimistic 5% a year, it would take more than nine decades for it to grow to $10 quadrillion. We can't know if Nvidia will even be around then. However, going by the company's prospects and the multiple markets that it serves with its graphics processing units (GPUs), there is a good chance it could turn out to be a solid long-term bet -- even if it's unlikely to turn a $10,000 investment into a million-dollar position again in our lifetimes.\nBut if you have that much in investible cash after covering your bills, paying off any high-interest debt you have, and building up an emergency fund, putting $10,000 into Nvidia as a part of a diversified portfolio could indeed help you get closer to your financial goals.\n\nMultiple catalysts make Nvidia a solid long-term buy\nAs the following chart shows, Nvidia's growth has taken off from the end of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\nThe company's data center business has played a central role in this growth. It delivered a record $47.5 billion in revenue in its recently concluded fiscal 2024, which was a massive 217% increase. The data center business produced 79% of Nvidia's total revenue of $60.1 billion.\nThis business segment is moving the needle in a big way for Nvidia as customers are lining up to buy its most powerful GPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. From Alphabet to Amazon to Meta Platforms and many more, Nvidia has an illustrious list of customers for its flagship H100 processor. More importantly, it will launch its next-generation H200 AI GPU soon, and demand for this chip is already high.\nHowever, this is not the only GPU opportunity Nvidia is set to benefit from. The company's gaming business has also gained solid momentum and could generate billions of dollars in annual revenue for the company in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that Nvidia remains the dominant player in the market for both AI and PC GPUs. While its share of the discrete PC GPU market reportedly stands at more than 80%, Wells Fargo recently estimated that it controls a whopping 98% of the AI GPU market. Precedence Research forecasts that the global GPU market's revenue will grow from $42 billion in 2022 to $773 billion in 2032, an annualized growth rate of almost 34%. Given Nvidia's market share now, its outstanding pace of growth looks sustainable.\nMore importantly, Nvidia is looking to increase its reach beyond these two markets. For instance, it is reportedly looking to get into the custom AI chip market, a lucrative growth opportunity. On the other hand, Nvidia's professional visualization business is now growing at an impressive pace as well.\nThe company generated $463 million in revenue in the professional visualization segment last quarter, a jump of 105% from the prior-year period. This segment includes the company's Omniverse digital twin platform and graphics cards used in workstation PCs. For the full fiscal year, its professional visualization revenue was just $1.6 billion, so it is still a small segment for the company, but the opportunity here is huge, and the company has already started capitalizing on it.\nAs such, there are multiple reasons this semiconductor giant could continue to grow at a healthy pace in the long run. This is also evident from the company's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which stands at just 0.12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA PEG Ratio data by YCharts.\nThe PEG ratio is a forward-looking metric that's calculated by dividing a company's price-to-earnings ratio by the annual earnings growth it is expected to deliver, usually over five years. A result of less than 1 indicates that a stock is undervalued when compared to the growth it could deliver.\nSo, investors looking to add a potential long-term winner to their portfolios should consider buying Nvidia stock right now, as it could help them in their quest to become millionaires.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Expectations are running extremely high.Investors are eagerly awaiting Huang\u2019s vision for artificial intelligence.Investors are also awaiting developments on the next\u00a0AI\u00a0chip from Nvidia that will replace H100. In an incredible turn of events, Jensen Huang has become more important for the stock market than Fed Chair Jerome Powell.Apple Inc AAPL has fallen behind in AI.\u00a0Now, Apple is trying to catch up by licensing Google\u2019s Gemini and negotiating with Google to incorporate Gemini into the iPhone. In The Arora Report analysis, such a move will bring regulator scrutiny. In The early trade, excitement over Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0AI\u00a0event is driving aggressive momo crowd buying in stocks.Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc Class C GOOG, Meta Platforms Inc META, Nvidia (NVDA), and TSLA.In the early trade, money flows are negative in Microsoft Corp MSFT.In the early trade, money flows are positive in\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 QQQ.Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksThe momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade.GoldThe momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings.The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD.\u00a0The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV.OilThe momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade.\u00a0Smart money is inactive in the early trade.For longer-term, please see oil ratings.The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.BitcoinBitcoin \u00a0is range bound.Protection Band And What To Do NowIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.\u00a0The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.\u00a0If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.\u00a0When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.\u00a0 High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.\u00a0Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the big artificial intelligence rally before anyone else, the new bull market of 2023, the bear market of 2022, new stock market highs right after the virus low in 2020, the virus drop in 2020, the DJIA rally to 30,000 when it was trading at 16,000, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, and the financial crash of 2008.

Here Are 3 Things Smart Investors Should Know      Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool   March 24, 2024 4 min read              In This Article:  NVDA       CSCO         Companies of all sizes are scrambling to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). From data centers, semiconductor chips, cloud computing, and large language models (LLMs), the prospects of generative AI has no bounds. At the center of all the action sits Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). After adding one-trillion dollars of market cap in less than two months, it's clear that investors cannot get enough of Nvidia stock. Ark Invest CEO and outspoken technology investor Cathie Wood penned a shareholder letter earlier this month outlining why she sees some turbulence ahead for Nvidia. Let's break down Wood's argument and assess the warning signs she's posing. A cautionary tale In her shareholder letter, Wood makes an apt comparison between Nvidia and Cisco. During the early days of the internet in the 1990s, Cisco enjoyed an extended moment in the spotlight thanks to the company's breakthroughs in routers and computer hardware equipment. Unsurprisingly, investors poured into Cisco stock, eventually propelling Cisco to the world's most-valuable company. Today, Cisco isn't even in the top-50 most-valuable companies measured by market cap.  On the surface, I understand the comparison Wood makes. Demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center services is abnormally high thanks to urgency-driven investments surrounding the AI narrative. Wood warns that rising competition could spell trouble for Nvidia, and it could be here sooner than later. While this may be true, I'm not completely sold on this argument. Understanding the underlying details around increased competition is important for investors to explore.   Image source: Getty Images.   Competition is rising, but... In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, Cisco failed to innovate at the same pace as its competition. As a result, computing hardware became a commoditized product, putting Cisco in somewhat of an existential crisis. While Cisco still operates a successful business, it's clear the company ultimately dropped out of favor with investors. I see things much differently with Nvidia. For starters, designing semiconductor chips and high-performance compute is much more sophisticated than producing routers. In other words, while Cisco's hardware was innovative in the early days of the internet, it didn't take long for competing products to emerge.  Nvidia absolutely has competition -- namely, from chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm. Moreover, tangential competition is quickly entering the scene from the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and even Tesla. While I agree with Wood that intensified competition could impact demand for Nvidia's chips, I don't think she's giving the company enough credit.   Story Continues Investors should realize that unlike Cisco, Nvidia has optionality. The company is diversifying its model outside of semiconductors and is building an end-to-end AI platform....Nvidia has a planAlthough the chip arena has a rising number of entrants, Nvidia still holds a competitive advantage. The company is a pioneer in the GPU space, providing Nvidia with an enviable first-mover position. While it's plausible that Nvidia could lose some of its pricing power and market share over time, I don't see the competition as too much of a threat.Moreover, with a whopping $26 billion of cash on the balance sheet, Nvidia has been aggressively investing in all sorts of areas across the AI spectrum in an effort to expand beyond chips. Two high-profile applications that Nvidia is exploring include humanoid robotics and enterprise software.Nvidia recently joined OpenAI, Microsoft, and Intel in a $675 million funding round for robotics start-up Figure AI. On top of that, the company is currently an investor in Databricks -- the world's most-valuable privately held software business. I see both of these partnerships as ways for Nvidia to bolster its under-the-radar software operation -- which is already a one-billion-dollar revenue run rate business.Could Nvidia end up as the next Cisco? Of course, anything is possible. I think what's more likely is that if Nvidia's bets in robotics and software don't pan out, then the company could begin to experience decelerating growth. A situation like that could absolutely cause some panic-induced selling from investors.But in my opinion, I don't see that happening. I am encouraged and impressed by all of the moves Nvidia is making outside of chips. While the stock is certainly enjoying some momentum, I think Nvidia can keep it up -- and I'm optimistic that the company's best days are ahead.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

The cuPQC library harnesses the parallelism of GPUs for their most demanding security algorithms.\nRefactoring Security for the Quantum Era\u00a0\u00a0\nResearchers have known for years that quantum computers will be able to break the public keys used today to secure communications. As these systems approach readiness, government and industry initiatives have been ramping up to address this vital issue.\nThe U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, is expected to introduce the first standard algorithms for post-quantum cryptography as early as this year.\nCryptographers working on advanced algorithms to replace today\u2019s public keys need powerful systems to design and test their work.\nHopper Delivers up to 500x Speedups With cuPQC\nIn its first benchmarks, cuPQC accelerated Kyber \u2014 an algorithm proposed as a standard for securing quantum-resistant keys \u2014 by up to 500x running on an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU compared with a CPU.\nThe speedups will be even greater with NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs, given Blackwell\u2019s enhancements for the integer math used in cryptography and other high performance computing workloads.\n\u201cSecuring data against quantum threats is a critically important problem, and we\u2019re excited to work with NVIDIA to optimize post-quantum cryptography,\u201d said Douglas Stebila, co-founder of the Open Quantum Safe project, a group spearheading work in the emerging field.\nAccelerating Community Efforts\nThe project is a part of the newly formed Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance, hosted by the Linux Foundation.\nThe alliance funds open source projects to develop post-quantum libraries and applications. NVIDIA is a member of the alliance with seats on both its steering and technical committees.\nNVIDIA is also collaborating with cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure on testing cuPQC.\nIn addition, leading companies in post-quantum cryptography such as evolutionQ, PQShield, QuSecure and SandboxAQ are collaborating with NVIDIA, many with plans to integrate cuPQC into their offerings.\n\u201cDifferent use cases will require a range of approaches for optimal acceleration,\u201d said Ben Packman, a senior vice president at PQShield. \u201cWe are delighted to explore cuPQC with NVIDIA.\u201d\nLearn More at GTC\nDevelopers working on post-quantum cryptography can sign up for updates on cuPQC here.\nTo learn more, watch a session about how NVIDIA is advancing quantum computing and attend an expert panel on the topic at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference, running through March 21 at the San Jose Convention Center and online.\nGet the full view from NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang in his GTC keynote.\n\n\nCategories: SupercomputingTags: Cloud Services | Cybersecurity | GTC 2024 | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | Quantum Computing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The initial hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) centered around OpenAI and its ChatGPT platform, which quickly attracted a $10 billion investment from Microsoft in early 2023.However, the technology industry quickly realized OpenAI's success wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's specialized data center chips, which are designed specifically to process AI workloads. As a result, Nvidia experienced a tidal wave of demand -- from the smallest of AI start-ups to the world's largest tech giants.Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) was the hottest piece of AI hardware last year, and it drove the company's data center revenue to $47.5 billion during its fiscal 2024 year (ended Jan. 28). That was a 217% increase from fiscal 2023.As the below chart shows, the data center segment accounted for 78% of Nvidia's total revenue ($60.9 billion) in fiscal 2024. That's a substantial increase from just 12% in fiscal 2017, when the company generated just $830 million in revenue from the data center. Gaming dominated Nvidia's business back then.Nvidia's hot streak still has legsNvidia will ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU this year, which can inference (ingest live data so AI models can make predictions) twice as fast as the H100, while consuming half the amount of energy. That's a winning combination for data center operators, so demand could be off the charts for the new chip.Nvidia is now a $2 trillion company, yet despite its surge in value over the past year, its stock isn't necessarily expensive based on forecast earnings per share for its fiscal 2025, which just began. Therefore, it won't be a surprise if Nvidia stock continues to trend higher.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Its AI Hub has more than 20 AI-enabled solutions in production. These solutions support predictive analytics, automation and anomaly detection, among other capabilities.\nWhile the firm recognizes that AI presents opportunities to enhance its processes to reduce risk across the organization, it is also actively working to consider and manage potential risks associated with AI through its robust risk management and governance processes.\nSome of the use cases supported by DGX SuperPOD include deposit forecasting, payment automation, predictive trade analytics and end-of-day cash balances.\nMore are coming. The company identified more than 600 opportunities in AI during a firmwide exercise last year, and dozens are already in development using such NVIDIA AI Enterprise software as NVIDIA NeMo, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and NVIDIA Base Command.\nTriton Inference Server is inference-serving software that streamlines AI inferencing or puts trained AI models to work.\nBase Command powers the DGX SuperPOD, delivering the best of NVIDIA software that enables businesses and their data scientists to accelerate AI development.\nNeMo is an end-to-end platform for developing custom generative AI, anywhere. It includes tools for training, and retrieval-augmented generation, guardrailing and toolkits, data curation tools, and pretrained models, offering enterprises an easy, cost-effective, and fast way to adopt generative AI.\nFueling Innovation Through Top Talent\nWith the new DGX SuperPOD, these tools will enable BNY to streamline and accelerate innovation within the firm and across the global financial system.\nHundreds of data scientists, solutions architects and risk, control and compliance professionals have been using the NVIDIA DGX platform, which delivers the world\u2019s leading solutions for enterprise AI development at scale, for several years.\nLeveraging the new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD will help the company rapidly expand its on-premises AI infrastructure.\nThe new system also underscores the company\u2019s commitment to adopting new technologies and attracting top talent across the world to help drive its innovation agenda forward.\n\n\nCategories: Hardware | SupercomputingTags: Banking | GTC 2024 | NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA NeMo | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.8%, setting a new high. The S&P 500 has risen 16 out of 18 weeks, chugging along after passing 5,000 for the first time last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or just under 100 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 1.1%, claiming a record of its own for the second day in a row.  Stocks are kicking off March with an upbeat reaction to PCE data that showed inflation continued to cool \u2014 easing worries the Federal Reserve would get more reason to hold off from interest rate cuts. But further scrutiny has highlighted signs of \"sticky\" inflation that will be harder to shift. Among big movers, Nvidia (NVDA), the tech company at the center of the AI excitement on Wall Street ended the day with a market cap exceeding $2 trillion for the first time. Meanwhile, shares in New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) tumbled 26% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of \"material weaknesses\" in the bank's loan processes. Finally, Dell (DELL) shares rose 31% in the wake of a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers. Developments at OpenAI caught the attention of investors tracking the sector. Elon Musk has sued the Microsoft-backed (MSFT) company and its CEO Sam Altman, among others, over a breach of contract. Also, the ChatGPT maker is reportedly set to name new board members in March to end an impasse linked to Altman's abrupt firing last year.

As growth resurges and stubborn inflation pressures remain, some officials have tempered expectations that rate cuts will arrive soon. The Fed will release heir updated forecasts on March 20, alongside its next monetary policy decision, which Wall Street expects to go unchanged.Thursday's inflation reading of the Fed's preferred measure the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4% over the prior month in January. And compared to a month ago, the market is more confident that a rate cut wont arrive until June.Investors and and policymakers will also be on the lookout for the latest data on job openings and labor turnover pinned to January 2024, providing more insight into employers' staffing prospects and the confidence of job seekers.Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week:   Sat, March 2, 2024 at 3:45 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Apple says goodbye to cars and hello to AI Save your condolences for the death of the AppleCar and send your congratulations. Who needs an expensive, low-margin electric vehicle when you have ambiguous hopes for AI?After an ill-fated, decade-long odyssey, Apple has said goodbye to its car project and will redirect resources to its artificial intelligence division. A blow to all who longed to see exactly which generation Fiat 500 Jony Ive would have paid homage to.If the decision was an admission of defeat \u2014 Elon Musk responded to the news on X with an emoji of a salute and a cigarette \u2014 it didn't feel like one. The collective response from several analysts and the market was something close to \"good riddance.\"Scuttling the multibillion-dollar insurgent effort will allow Cupertino to focus on a broad AI strategy within the Apple ecosystem, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.Others have pointed to the way Apple's software and intuitive design have already reshaped the car industry through CarPlay, software that connects iPhones to cars, effectively transforming other companies' hardware into extensions of its walled garden.Musk's recent fuss over unlocking Tesla's AI potential makes Apple's car exit even more compelling. CEO Tim Cook already has multiple conduits for intimate data gathering and platforms for refining AI tools. Musk's vehicles are parked outside; Cook's screens tuck you in at night.But there's something too on the nose and a little bleak about the world's most valuable company shuffling staff from its daring EV project to the trend of the moment, pursuing a more dazzling version of ChatGPT, or finding immersive ways to sink users more deeply into their couch. You'd think the phrase \"If you can't beat em, join em\" shouldn't apply to an enterprise packing hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at a problem.At the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, Cook said Apple will share details of its new AI features later this year. It's still not clear how AI will resuscitate Apple's growth story. But at least now we know where it won't come from.   Sat, March 2, 2024 at 3:00 AM GMT+8 Alexandra Canal  Earnings season highlights media's two-sided dilemma Legacy media is facing a two-pronged conundrum: TV networks are in decline as a dismal ad environment drags on revenue. In the meantime, streaming remains unprofitable for the majority of players as costs rise and subscriber growth stalls.Most recently, Paramount (PARA) reported linear ad revenue slumped 15% year over year in Q4, steeper than the 12% drop expected by analysts and also worse than the 14% drag seen in the third quarter.Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA) also saw ad revenue in their traditional broadcast and cable businesses slump this earnings season.It's a tough spot for media companies, which have invested in expensive streaming endeavors amid the mass exodus of pay TV consumers.Prior to the cord-cutting phenomenon, linear advertising and cable affiliate fees had consistently boosted revenues. But as ad buyers now flee traditional TV channels in favor of digital options like streaming, companies are beginning to realize that they may never see the same level of returns. Adding on to financial pressures? The streaming boom may be over.\"The headlines have been unavoidable suggesting that the boom times are over and streaming video is in a new phase of sobriety,\" subscription analytics platform Antenna wrote in its quarterly \"State of Subscriptions\" report published on Tuesday.Antenna revealed that subscribers to premium subscription services grew at their slowest pace since before the pandemic began, rising just 10.1% compared to the 21.6% seen in 2022.On top of slowing growth, churn \u2014 or subscribers canceling their streaming plans \u2014 has nearly tripled since 2019 with 140.5 million cancellations in 2023, the largest drop in subscribers over the last five years.As consumer sign-ups slow, streaming profitability still has a long way to go. Virtually all media companies continue to lose money on that business, with the exception of Netflix and very recently Warner Bros. Discovery.But even WBD's streaming turnaround wasn't enough to lift earnings in the fourth quarter, further highlighting the struggle of legacy media's balancing act. The company still reported a miss on both the top and bottom lines, dragged down by a drop in networks revenue and the ad market plummet.Read more here.

Fisker reported that given its financial condition, evolving dealership sales approach and challenging EV market, it has \u201csubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern\u201d when the company files its official financial statements for 2023. Fisker also said it would reduce its headcount by 15%.West Texas Intermediate (CL=F): Oil prices jumped 2% amid signs of tight supply, rising above $80 per barrel for the first time this year. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also rose to trade above $83 per barrel.Dell (DELL): Shares of the technology company rose 25% Friday morning following a quarterly sales and profit beat fueled by AI prospects for its servers.New York Community Bancorp (NYCB): Shares tumbled 27% after the exit of its CEO, a $2.7 billion quarterly loss, and findings of \"material weaknesses\" in the bank's loan processes.Apple (AAPL): Shares of the iPhone maker fell 1% after the stock was initially buoyed by a report that it had canceled its decade-long car project and would shift resources to its artificial intelligence efforts. During the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.2% or about 70 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) rose 0.8%.   Sat, March 2, 2024 at 1:02 AM GMT+8 Ines Ferr\u00e9  Oil prices jump 3% amid signs of tight supply Oil futures rose as much as 3% on Friday to their highest levels since November, as market conditions point to tight supplies.West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) jumped above $80 per barrel for the first time this year. Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, also rose to trade above $83 per barrel.Friday's jump follows two consecutive months of gains. Greater-than-expected demand out of Asia coupled with expectations that oil alliance OPEC+ will extend its output reductions past March has helped lift contract prices.\"I think the rally in crude oil prices is on the expectation that OPEC+ will continue with their voluntary production cuts well into the second quarter of 2024,\" Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates told Yahoo Finance on Friday.Near-term contracts are currently trading at a premium compared to later months, a market condition called \"backwardation\" which signals crude supply tightness.Read more here.

But one homebuilder says consumers are more willing to swallow higher rates than they used to be.According to Mortgage News Daily, the benchmark rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan reached 7.16% on two separate days over the last week and settled at 7.1% on Thursday.\"The consumers have come a long way in the last year, 18 months, when rates were flirting at that 7%,\u201d Taylor Morrison (TMHC) CEO Sheryl Palmer told Yahoo Finance Live Thursday.\u201cBack then they were still hoping rates would go back to 4%. I think the consumer has met us kind of in the middle, recognizing that rates in the fives or sixes is actually, from any kind of long-term historic perspective, a really good rate,\u201d Palmer added.Taylor Morrison like others in the industry is able to offer such rates to buyers through incentives like mortgage rate buydowns, where the builder covers a portion of the interest paid on a loan.\u201cThe reality is every buyer needs something a little bit different,\u201d Palmer said.\u201c[Some] want a lower rate. \u2026The ability to personalize [rates] today, I think, is most important. But I think it's created a real advantage for the new home market versus that opportunity doesn't really exist in the existing market.\u201d  Sat, March 2, 2024 at 12:33 AM GMT+8 Hamza Shaban  Elon Musk sues OpenAI for abandoning its original mission and pursuing profit  Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI, and its CEO Sam Altman over what he alleges is a breach of contract.Musk claims the company is no longer following its original goal of helping humanity, and is instead focused on profits.\"OpenAI has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,\" the lawsuit states.Musk is asking the court to force OpenAI to make its research and technology publicly available and to block the AI company from using its assets to financially benefit Microsoft (MSFT) or other individuals.The lawsuit comes as OpenAI faces a probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into whether investors in the company were misled following a chaotic overhaul of the company's governance structure in November. Amid these regulatory troubles, OpenAI is planning to appoint several new board members within the next month, the Washington Post reported Thursday.Musk stepped down from OpenAI's board in 2018 and has previously called for regulation on AI technology. The owner of the website formally known as Twitter and the CEO of SpaceX also claims his own AI startup, xAI. Musk's AI company launched its own ChatGPT rival dubbed Grok, available to X premium subscribers.

Fri, March 1, 2024 at 10:27 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  Dell talks up AI in earnings call New day, same old signs of a tech bubble.Shares of formerly sleepy Dell (DELL) are up 31% pre-market because it spent most of its earnings call last night talking about AI. Yes, the same Dell that sold you your first desktop computer in the 1990s.Scenes from Dell's earnings call:\"We have positioned ourselves well in AI. We've already started to benefit from the momentum we're seeing. We saw strong demand continue for our AI-optimized server portfolio, including our flagship PowerEdge XE9680, which remains the fastest-ramping solution in company history. We have just started to touch the AI opportunities ahead of us, including broader adoption of AI by enterprise customers and the projected growth in unstructured data where we are well positioned with industry-leading storage solutions.\" \u2014 Jeff Clarke, Dell COO\"AI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X.\" Jeff ClarkeThe hyper AI-infused Dell call prompted this report headline from JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee:\"Just What the Investors Ordered With AI-Led ISG Acceleration; Raise Estimates and PT\"I guess nothing more to see here \u2014 Dell apparently is no longer a PC seller, but an AI beast that is going to change the world alongside Nvidia (NVDA)!Welcome to the bubble, friends.   Fri, March 1, 2024 at 10:26 PM GMT+8 Brian Sozzi  Hat tip to AMD CEO Lisa Su I remember it like it was yesterday.I was sitting in a meeting room with former Cisco (CSCO) CEO John Chambers, just a casual meeting to see what he was up to in life after leading the networking giant. Rather than discuss where he was playing golf next, Chambers went on and on about then Cisco board member and AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su.\"Watch Lisa Su, watch what she does over the next few years,\" Chambers told me (I still have the comment written down in my phone's notepad).The market has more than watched what Su has done since joining the former also-ran AMD as CEO in 2014. It has become a believer in the humble, focused leadership of Su and the results she continues to drive for shareholders.The company broke through the $300 billion market cap level on Thursday and is poised to tack on more gains today.Su refuses to play second fiddle in the AI chip race to rival Nvidia (NVDA), led by the black-leather-jacket-wearing Jensen Huang. Su isn't awestruck by Intel (INTC) building chip factories in the US.She just gets transformational things done, period. And right now, that includes rolling out very powerful AI chips to supply an under-supplied market.\"There are going to be multiple winners in this market,\" Su told me in early December. \"I think there's a great growth opportunity for us; we expect to gain market share.\"That December interview from Yahoo Finance Live below.

As a direct result of its huge stock price increase, the cost of one Nvidia share is nearing $1,000. This threshold may seem arbitrary, but it's actually an important milestone with a special place in the stock market's mass psychology. Therefore, management teams often consider splitting their stocks around this nice, round number. Furthermore, Nvidia's management team has a history of enacting stock splits.\nIs Nvidia preparing for another split?\u00a0\nThe conditions are right\nStock splits can have both real and artificial effects. On the artificial side, you're essentially cutting the same-sized pizza into smaller slices. Investors with access to brokerages that offer fractional shares can already cut Nvidia's stock into pieces as small as they want (usually down to one-thousandth of a share).\nHowever, not every investor (especially those outside the U.S.) has access to this capability. In that sense, Nvidia's potential stock split becomes a real factor since more investors can purchase the stock without fear of overweighting their portfolio to one company. If you only have $100 to invest this month, a stock changing hands at $1,000 per share feels out of reach (even if fractional shares are available in your favorite stock brokerage).\n\nBut will Nvidia do it? The company's history of stock splits suggests that another one could be imminent.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia has split its stock five times since it went on the market. The latest was in 2021, when it did a 4-for-1 split. The stock traded for around a pre-split price of $744 -- cheaper than it is today. \nBefore that, Nvidia last split its stock in 2007, when it would have traded at a split-adjusted price of just over $50. Stock splits were far more common back then, so the instances before the 2021 split may be less useful for forecasting purposes in 2024.\nNow that the stock price is above 2021 pre-split levels again, I'd say Nvidia is highly likely to enact a stock split.\nWhen will Nvidia announce another stock split?\nAfter Nvidia announced its stock split on May 21, 2021, the stock had a strong run-up until the split took effect on July 20, increasing nearly 40% at its peak. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts.\nThis same time frame would also make sense in 2024, as Nvidia's annual meeting occurs in June. So if you're looking for a stock split announcement, stay tuned to Nvidia's Q1 FY 2025 results, which will be reported sometime in late May.\nIs right now a good time to buy the stock in anticipation of a run-up due to buying frenzies caused by a stock split? I'd say no. The only good reason to buy a stock is if the underlying business is worth owning. In Nvidia's case, the answer to that question has been a resounding \"yes,\" as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in high demand due to interest in artificial intelligence (AI) computing.\nNvidia has continuously posted amazing revenue growth figures. Its latest results (Q4 FY 2024, ending Jan. 28) included a revenue rise of 265% to $22.1 billion and a projection for another 234% rise to $24 billion in Q1 FY 2025.) \n\n\n\n\n\nThat sounds like a great business. If the company continues to post results like that, management will likely enact a stock split. While some price movement may be associated with that announcement, don't lose sight of the bigger picture: Nvidia has been one of the biggest winners so far in the AI movement.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Key Points:Nvidia unveiled its new Blackwell chip.  Jensen Huang praised the new product.  Shares dropped 2% in after-hours trading.  Chipmaking giant Nvidia NVDA is changing the rules of the game once again. During the first session of its four-day GTC developers\u2019 event, Nvidia wasted no time and unveiled its latest AI chip, redefining speed, power, and dominance. Chief executive Jensen Huang revealed the GB200 superchip combining two of the brand-new Blackwell graphics processing units with the existing Grace central processing unit.  The result is a whopping 208 billion transistors, dwarfing the 80 billion in last year\u2019s H100 chips. Computing power is in for an overhaul\u2014the new superchip can boost performance by up to 30 times for large language model inference workloads. Huang praised the new product, saying \u201cthe inference capability of Blackwell is off the charts,\u201d noting that there was \u201cunbelievable excitement\u201d about it.  After the event concluded, shares of Nvidia had already closed regular trading and drifted about 2% to the downside in off-hours dealmaking.

Nvidia shares dropped 5.6% Friday.  Stock is up over 80% on the year.  Massive demand keeps hopes high.  Nvidia stock NVDA acted more like a penny stock on Friday rather than a $2 trillion tech behemoth which ranks third in the world\u2019s biggest companies list. The chipmaking juggernaut seesawed more than 10% to the downside, erasing over $200 billion from its value in less than an hour to hit a session low of $866 a share. Fortunately for the tech evangelists, the bulls stepped in and bought the dip.  But only halfway. Shares of Nvidia still closed down 5.6% on the day, snapping a six-session winning streak. The drastic pullback stoked talks of a frothy stock in an AI-charged bubble. Nvidia\u2019s formidable rise has propelled shares more than threefold in 2023 and another 80% so far this year. Now the question lingering on everyone\u2019s mind: Is that the start of a pullback or is there more to the breakneck rally?  There\u2019s no doubt that Nvidia\u2019s spectacular run is backed by blowout earnings and profits. Rising demand from AI data centers opens up visibility into future cash flow, emboldening CEO Jensen Huang to cite even more growth with another $24 billion in earnings for the current quarter. Enthusiasm over the stock and the broader AI space may be speculative but it\u2019s nowhere near exhaustion. How share price reacts, however, is a different story and one that does not necessarily obey fundamentals.

However, before diving into specifics, let\u2019s examine the prevailing dynamics influencing the sector.\nFollowing the pandemic, the semiconductor industry exhibited notable resilience, adeptly maneuvering through supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and shifting consumer preferences. Despite these hurdles, the sector not only endured but thrived, underscoring its adaptability and ability to excel amid fluctuating external forces.\nFor 2024, IDC forecasts a resurgence in the chip industry propelled by rebounding smartphone demand and rising requirements for AI chips, with an anticipated annual growth rate surpassing 20%. Correspondingly, Gartner (IT) predicts a parallel upsurge, estimating a 16.8% increase in global semiconductor revenue, reaching $624 billion.\nAligned with these buoyant forecasts, SEMI\u2019s latest quarterly report depicts a landscape of expansion, projecting a 6.4% upswing in global semiconductor capacity for the year, surpassing 30 million wafers per month for the inaugural time. The surge succeeds a 5.5% rise observed in 2023, showcasing the industry\u2019s continuing momentum.\n\n\nThe expansion is not occurring in isolation; instead, it is being propelled by the adoption of cutting-edge technologies such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC), alongside a resurgence in end demand for chips.\nAs global chip demand continues its upward trajectory, the industry enjoys a favorable position for enduring growth. Furthermore, augmented government incentives and a surge in fab investments are serving as catalysts for these auspicious trends. Consequently, the chip market stands poised to inaugurate a new era of innovation and prosperity.\nAgainst this backdrop, NVDA and TSM are strategically positioned to capitalize on the industry\u2019s favorable conditions.\nIn terms of price performance, NVDA has climbed 27.9% over the past month, while TSM gained 19.2% during the same period. Additionally, NVDA surged 126.4% over the past nine months, closing the last trading session at $887, whereas TSM gained 44.4% during the same period, closing the last trading session at $141.57.\n10 STOCKS TO SELL NOW!But which Semiconductor & Wireless Chip stock could be a better pick? Let\u2019s find out.\nLatest Developments\nOn February 28, NVDA, ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW), and Hugging Face unveiled StarCoder2, a revolutionary suite of open-access large language models. StarCoder2 introduces three variants: a 3-billion-parameter model by NOW, a 7-billion-parameter model by Hugging Face, and a formidable 15-billion-parameter model engineered by NVDA using NVIDIA NeMo and trained on NVDA\u2019s accelerated infrastructure.\nGiven the prevalence of proprietary programming languages across software ecosystems, these code LLMs promise to catalyze efficiency and innovation in myriad industries. NVDA\u2019s partnership would ensure the delivery of secure, ethically developed models, fostering broader accessibility to accountable generative AI and nurturing global expansion.\n\n\nOn February 24, TSM celebrated a pivotal moment as it inaugurated its majority-owned subsidiary, Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc. (JASM), in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. Furthermore, the collaboration with minority investors Sony Semiconductor Solutions (SSS), DENSO, and Toyota, along with plans for a second fab, represents a strategic move poised to benefit TSM significantly.\nThe expansion into Japan would fortify TSM\u2019s global footprint, enhancing its presence in key markets and diversifying its production capabilities. With JASM\u2019s anticipated production capacity exceeding 100,000 12-inch wafers monthly, TSM stands to bolster its revenue streams across various sectors, including automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and high-performance computing.\nRecent Financial Results\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on January 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s non-GAAP revenue rose 265.3% year-over-year to $22.10 billion. Its non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS came in at $12.84 billion and $5.16 per share, up 490.6% and 486.4% from the prior year\u2019s period, respectively.\nHowever, as of January 28, 2024, NVDA\u2019s total current liabilities stood at $10.63 billion, up from $6.56 billion as of January 29, 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarter, which ended December 31, 2023, TSM reported net revenue of NT$625.53 billion ($19.63 billion). Its net income and\u00a0EPS\u00a0amounted to NT$238.31 billion ($7.48 billion) and NT$9.21, respectively. Moreover, as of December 31, 2023, TSM\u2019s total current liabilities decreased 3.2% year-over-year to $913.58 billion ($29.71 billion).\nPast and Expected Financial Performance\nOver the past three years, NVDA\u2019s revenue and EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 54% and 81%, respectively. Its net income and EPS grew at respective CAGRs of 90.1% and 90.3%, respectively, over the period. Moreover, the company\u2019s total assets rose at a CAGR of 31.7% over the same time frame.\nFor the fiscal year ending January 2025, analysts expect the company\u2019s revenue to increase 80.9% year-over-year to $110.20 billion. Likewise, its EPS for the ongoing year is expected to grow 89.8% from the previous year to $24.59.\nOver the past three years, TSM\u2019s revenue and EBITDA rose at a CAGR of 17.3% and 17.4%, respectively. In addition, the company\u2019s net income and EPS both increased at an 18% CAGR. Furthermore, its total assets grew at a CAGR of 26.1% during the same period.\nThe consensus revenue estimate of $84.22 billion for the fiscal year ending December 2024 reflects a 23% year-over-year increase. Additionally, the company\u2019s EPS for the same period is expected to grow 21.1% from the prior year to $6.27.\nProfitability\n\n\nTSM\u2019s trailing-12-month revenue is 1.2 times that of what NVDA generates. Additionally, TSM is more profitable, with a trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 66.84% compared to NVDA\u2019s 56.60%. Similarly, TSM\u2019s trailing-12-month cash from operations of $40.46 billion compares with NVDA\u2019s $28.09 billion.\nValuation\nIn terms of forward P/E, TSM is trading at 21.46x, 43% lower than NVDA\u2019s 37.62x. Moreover, TSM\u2019s forward EV/Sales of 6.88x is 63.9% lower than NVDA\u2019s 19.06x. Furthermore, TSM\u2019s forward EV/EBITDA of 10.11x compare with NVDA\u2019s 29.63x.\nThus, TSM is more affordable.\n\n\nPOWR Ratings \nNVDA has an overall rating of C, which equates to Neutral in our proprietary POWR Ratings system.

They can run locally on PCs and workstations powered by NVIDIA GeForce and RTX GPUs.\nLLMs excel at summarizing large volumes of text, classifying and mining data for insights, and generating new text in a user-specified style, tone or format. They can facilitate communication in any language, even beyond ones spoken by humans, such as computer code or protein and genetic sequences.\nWhile the first LLMs dealt solely with text, later iterations were trained on other types of data. These multimodal LLMs can recognize and generate images, audio, videos and other content forms.\nChatbots like ChatGPT were among the first to bring LLMs to a consumer audience, with a familiar interface built to converse with and respond to natural-language prompts. LLMs have since been used to help developers write code and scientists to drive drug discovery and vaccine development.\nBut the AI models that power those functions are computationally intensive. Combining advanced optimization techniques and algorithms like quantization with RTX GPUs, which are purpose-built for AI, helps make LLMs compact enough and PCs powerful enough to run locally \u2014 no internet connection required. And a new breed of lightweight LLMs like Mistral \u2014 one of the LLMs powering Chat with RTX \u2014 sets the stage for state-of-the-art performance with lower power and storage demands.\nWhy Do LLMs Matter?\nLLMs can be adapted for a wide range of use cases, industries and workflows. This versatility, combined with their high-speed performance, offers performance and efficiency gains across virtually all language-based tasks.\nDeepL, running on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, uses advanced AI to provide accurate text translations.\nLLMs are widely used in language translation apps such as DeepL, which uses AI and machine learning to provide accurate outputs.\nMedical researchers are training LLMs on textbooks and other medical data to enhance patient care. Retailers are leveraging LLM-powered chatbots to deliver stellar customer support experiences. Financial analysts are tapping LLMs to transcribe and summarize earning calls and other important meetings. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\nChatbots \u2014 like Chat with RTX \u2014 and writing assistants built atop LLMs are making their mark on every facet of knowledge work, from content marketing and copywriting to legal operations. Coding assistants were among the first LLM-powered applications to point toward the AI-assisted future of software development. Now, projects like ChatDev are combining LLMs with AI agents \u2014 smart bots that act autonomously to help answer questions or perform digital tasks \u2014 to spin up an on-demand, virtual software company. Just tell the system what kind of app is needed and watch it get to work.\nLearn more about LLM agents on the NVIDIA developer blog.\nEasy as Striking Up a Conversation\u00a0\nMany people\u2019s first encounter with generative AI came by way of a chatbot such as ChatGPT, which simplifies the use of LLMs through natural language, making user action as simple as telling the model what to do.\nLLM-powered chatbots can help generate a draft of marketing copy, offer ideas for a vacation, craft an email to customer service and even spin up original poetry.\nAdvances in image generation and multimodal LLMs have extended the chatbot\u2019s realm to include analyzing and generating imagery \u2014 all while maintaining the wonderfully simple user experience. Just describe an image to the bot or upload a photo and ask the system to analyze it. It\u2019s chatting, but now with visual aids.\n\nFor more on how these bots are designed, check out the on-demand webinar on Building Intelligent AI Chatbots Using RAG.\n\n\nFuture advancements will help LLMs expand their capacity for logic, reasoning, math and more, giving them the ability to break complex requests into smaller subtasks.\nProgress is also being made on AI agents, applications capable of taking a complex prompt, breaking it into smaller ones, and engaging autonomously with LLMs and other AI systems to complete them. ChatDev is an example of an AI agent framework, but agents aren\u2019t limited to technical tasks.\nFor example, users could ask a personal AI travel agent to book a family vacation abroad. The agent would break that task into subtasks \u2014\u00a0itinerary planning, booking travel and lodging, creating packing lists, finding a dog walker \u2014\u00a0and independently execute them in order.\nUnlock Personal Data With RAG\nAs powerful as LLMs and chatbots are for general use, they can become even more helpful when combined with an individual user\u2019s data. By doing so, they can help analyze email inboxes to uncover trends, comb through dense user manuals to find the answer to a technical question about some hardware, or summarize years of bank and credit card statements.\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to hone LLMs for a particular dataset.\nAn example of RAG on a PC.\nRAG enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources. By connecting an LLM with practically any external resource, RAG lets users chat with data repositories while also giving the LLM the ability to cite its sources. The user experience is as simple as pointing the chatbot toward a file or directory.\nFor example, a standard LLM will have general knowledge about content strategy best practices, marketing tactics and basic insights into a particular industry or customer base. But connecting it via RAG to marketing assets supporting a product launch would allow it to analyze the content and help plan a tailored strategy.\nRAG works with any LLM, as the application supports it. NVIDIA\u2019s Chat with RTX tech demo is an example of RAG connecting an LLM to a personal dataset. It runs locally on systems with a GeForce RTX or NVIDIA RTX professional GPU.\nTo learn more about RAG and how it compares to fine-tuning an LLM, read the tech blog, RAG 101: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Questions Answered.\nExperience the Speed and Privacy of Chat with RTX\nChat with RTX is a local, personalized chatbot demo that\u2019s easy to use and free to download. It\u2019s built with RAG functionality and TensorRT-LLM and RTX acceleration. It supports multiple open-source LLMs, including\u00a0Meta\u2019s Llama 2 and Mistral\u2019s Mistral. Support for Google\u2019s Gemma is coming in a future update.\nChat with RTX connects users to their personal data through RAG.\nUsers can easily connect local files on a PC to a supported LLM simply by dropping files into a folder and pointing the demo to that location. Doing so enables it to answer queries with quick, contextually relevant answers.\nSince Chat with RTX runs locally on Windows with GeForce RTX PCs and NVIDIA RTX workstations, results are fast \u2014 and the user\u2019s data stays on the device. Rather than relying on cloud-based services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.\nTo learn more about how AI is shaping the future, tune in to NVIDIA GTC, a global AI developer conference running March 18-21 in San Jose, Calif., and online.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: AI Decoded | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Creators \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock is up 530%, while Supermicro's has risen an astounding 1,300%. \nIn other words, if you invested $10,000 in each company on Jan. 1, 2023, you'd have nearly $205,000. But after that kind of performance, many investors may wonder if they can still invest in these two AI leaders without the risk of losing serious capital in just a few months.\nSo, are either of these two stocks a buy right now? And if so, which is the better purchase?\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer are not competitors\nNvidia makes best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) that are perfect for training AI models. GPUs can process intense calculations efficiently, making them the best tool for the job. When a client wants to build a supercomputer capable of training AI models, it doesn't order a handful of GPUs; it orders thousands. With Nvidia's flagship GPU, the H100, costing an estimated $30,000 a piece, that's a massive growth driver for Nvidia. \n\nHowever, you can't just connect these GPUs together with a few cables and call it a day. You need a specialized server that properly networks these devices and combines them in clusters to maximize efficiency. That's where Super Micro Computer comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some tech giants may have this expertise in-house, many do not, so they contract Supermicro to build their servers. Supermicro has many different server designs based on the application and expected workload size, so customers of all varieties can find what they need. \n\nThis highlights the first difference between these two investments: Nvidia is a company that nearly all AI-focused businesses work with, while only some work with Supermicro. This doesn't mean Supermicro is doomed to fail, but it is a risk factor investors should consider. Supermicro could be dethroned by a competitor undercutting pricing, while Nvidia might only be knocked off its pedestal by someone creating a more powerful GPU -- something competitors have been struggling to do for a long time.\nWhen examining each company's financials, Nvidia also starts to pull away.\nNvidia's stock is cheaper than Supermicro's\nBoth companies are growing rapidly, and their projections for the next quarter are also quite strong. In Q4 of FY 2024 (ending Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue rose 265% year over year to $22.1 billion. It also gave guidance for Q1 revenue of $24 billion, indicating 234% growth. \n\n\n\n\n\nSupermicro also delivered strong results, with its Q2 FY 2024 (ending Dec. 31) revenue rising 103% to $3.67 billion. For its next quarter, Supermicro projects growth of 188% to 219%, placing it in the same realm as Nvidia. \nWhile Nvidia experienced the first wave of GPU demand, Supermicro's growth is just starting. However, the stock already responded with strong price appreciation because investors know what kind of growth to expect based on Nvidia's performance over the past year.\nAs a result, Supermicro's stock is much more expensive than Nvidia's on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a forward P/E ratio when a company is undergoing a massive change is wise, as it uses analyst projections to value it. There is still room for error (as no one has a crystal ball), but it gives investors an idea of what they're paying for.\nBecause Nvidia is cheaper from this metric and has stronger growth and vital product positioning, I think it's a much better buy than Super Micro Computer.\nShould the strong AI demand persist for a few years, both stocks could be excellent picks, but Nvidia remains the king of AI investment opportunities right now.\n\n\n\nKeithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Together, we\u2019re combining the power of Adobe\u2019s PDF services with NVIDIA technologies to advance what\u2019s possible with large language models (LLMs) and PDFs on three fronts: we will draw on Adobe\u2019s PDF technology and expertise to support NVIDIA in training and tuning next-generation LLMs \u2014 help companies apply generative AI to the data stored in PDFs utilizing NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA NeMo microservices and Adobe PDF services \u2014 and develop open datasets to promote LLM research and development.\nOur recent introduction of AI Assistant in Acrobat leveraged the intelligence in PDFs to accelerate individual productivity, and now we\u2019re looking to scale that value to the enterprise. NVIDIA\u2019s innovation with LLMs and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), combined with Adobe PDF extract technologies, represents a step toward a new era of document intelligence.\n\u201cPDF documents store immense volumes of valuable information that can be used to customize the intelligence of every enterprise\u2019s generative AI applications,\u201d said Manuvir Das, vice president of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. \u201cThis new chapter of NVIDIA and Adobe\u2019s partnership will help businesses tap into the value of their PDF data using NVIDIA microservices to make their generative AI agents and copilots powerful productivity tools.\u201d\nTraining and tuning next-gen LLMs\nAdobe and NVIDIA are working together to train new NVIDIA LLMs. Pairing NVIDIA AI foundry services with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and leveraging Adobe\u2019s PDF Extract services, we are building datasets to train and tune next-generation NVIDIA AI foundation models, including NVIDIANemotronLLMs. These models and open-source and commercial LLMs run on NVIDIA NIM inference microservices in the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.\nPDF documents house some of the world\u2019s most valuable information. However, transforming the data into usable intelligence is usually difficult or impossible because the data is unstructured. As the inventor and innovator of PDF, Adobe is the global authority on PDF structure and content. Our PDF Extract services deliver highly accurate data extraction across various document types \u2014 native and scanned PDFs \u2014 without any customization or setup. This technology leverages the same artificial intelligence and machine learning models behind the award-winning Acrobat Liquid Mode to transform unstructured data in PDFs into rich, structured data for efficient analysis.\nScaling generative AI to global enterprises\nWe are also looking at new ways to scale high-performance generative AI capabilities to global enterprises. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities can scale the usefulness of LLMs for enterprises by combining generated responses with proprietary data and external knowledge bases to provide more up-to-date and reliable answers.\nWe are exploring combining Adobe\u2019s PDF services to extract proprietary information from inside organizations\u2019 PDFs into specialized knowledge bases with pre-trained NVIDIA LLMs, enabling enterprises to talk to their data using natural language. We are also investigating ways to help enterprises use Adobe Document Cloud products and services with NVIDIA NIM inference and NVIDIA NeMo Retriever microservices to enable synchronous use of PDFs in production apps.\nIn addition, we\u2019re exploring using NVIDIA accelerated computing and enterprise AI software, like NVIDIA NIM, with Adobe AI-enabled products, including Adobe Firefly, to speed time to market and provide high-performance, interactive customer experiences.\nBuilding open datasets for research\nAdobe and NVIDIA are also bringing their collective expertise to accelerate research on LLMs and the role of digital documents. We are collaborating on a jointly curated dataset to enhance the research and development of LLMs using PDFs as pre-training data. Together, we will enable open research into post-processing techniques for making PDF data maximally useful for LLM and very large model (VLM) training. We plan to publish this dataset's findings, methodologies, and impact and make it available for research purposes, ensuring easy access and widespread distribution among researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/promotions/products/document-cloud/document-cloud\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/03/06/ibm-reimagines-content-creation-digital-marketing-adobe-firefly-generative-ai\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/02/28/how-mayo-clinic-applies-empathy-digital-transformation\nhttps://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/02/28/platforms-people-process-how-humana-personalizes-healthcare-consumer-experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

future in healthcare\nMedtronic collaborates with NVIDIA to drive AI advancements in the detection of colorectal cancer\n\nInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKimberly Powell, VP of Healthcare at NVIDIA\n\nLast year, Medtronic and Cosmo Intelligent Medical Devices announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to build a new AI platform for GI Genius\u2122, the first AI-powered endoscopy module. The use of AI in healthcare is growing significantly, spurred in part by such collaborations between companies like Medtronic and NVIDIA.\nFor NVIDIA\u2019s perspective on the future of AI and healthcare technology, we spoke with Kimberly Powell, the company\u2019s vice president of healthcare, who shared why she believes the technology can serve as a healthcare \u201cco-pilot\u201d for everyone, including patients and doctors.\nNote: This interview was edited for length and clarity.\nWhy is NVIDIA investing in healthcare? \nWhen I started with NVIDIA, one of the very first phone calls I made was to a company that\u2019s well known for building CT scanners. One thing the healthcare technology industry focuses on is seeing inside the body, and medical devices can generate massive amounts of visual data. That data must be processed and turned into something humans can read. That\u2019s where we come in. NVIDIA accelerated computing is capable of processing data very, very fast, and now we can apply AI applications of all kinds to enhance the information coming from sources like medical instruments and health records. Beyond providing computing platforms, NVIDIA and its partners are enabling the shift toward holistic patient care by augmenting healthcare providers\u2019 operational and clinical care capabilities. NVIDIA has been working in healthcare for over a decade, and we are certain this is an industry in which we\u2019re making a difference and to which we can continue contributing significantly.\nWhy did NVIDIA partner with Medtronic?\nMedtronic, a world leader in healthcare technology, recognized early that AI can be a co-pilot in healthcare. By overlaying AI as an assistant to healthcare professionals, they can catch issues earlier and make sure patients have the best outcomes. NVIDIA is building computing platforms that can help healthcare companies achieve their goals and benefit patients.\nSince NVIDIA began collaborating with Medtronic, I\u2019ve learned a lot about colorectal cancer and how to use technology to help reduce the miss rates of polyps. Colorectal cancer is the number one cancer killer of men in the U.S., so, well, I can\u2019t think of anything more meaningful to work on than that.\nHow will the integration of NVIDIA\u2019s platform help improve the detection of colorectal polyps?\nThe computing platform that we\u2019ve built with Medtronic can deliver AI at scale, bringing this capability to more places in the world and helping doctors with the early detection of colorectal cancer during real-time colonoscopies. Also, the platform can deliver many AI applications to expand the functionality of the device. It all comes down to the software and the ease of updates. I always go back to smartphones and how they continuously improve with over-the-air updates. It\u2019s a similar case with the platform we\u2019ve created for the GI Genius\u2122 intelligent endoscopy system.\nRecently Medtronic conducted a significant survey about how Americans feel about AI. Overall, it showed that Americans are very optimistic about certain applications of AI, such as diagnosing diseases. But it also noted some skepticism. Do you see that changing in the future with the evolution of technology?\nWith ChatGPT, everybody can experience AI in some shape or form, and that\u2019s going to build consumer trust. We helped make this huge AI moment possible by building computers that enable those AI applications to be trained and deployed at scale, so, for example, even my eight-year-old daughter can interact with an AI. Grandparents, too, are talking about how they use ChatGPT. If you sit back and think about how it has stunned you personally, just as a consumer of technology, you might think to yourself, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want every doctor to have this type of capability at their fingertips?\u201d\nI go back to this idea of AI as a co-pilot. It\u2019s an assistant. It helps people automate tasks that might not leverage their skillsets. It helps bring together information in one place, in a given amount of time, which may not have been possible otherwise. It\u2019s not about completely automating all processes. It's about augmenting them. And I think that if the world can really understand that, people will want the augmentation, these skills, the second pair of eyes, these co-pilots. They would want these tools to be at every clinician\u2019s disposal, because it\u2019s going to be what transforms their work, what elevates their craft. I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t all be chomping at the bit to get more of this going and out there in the world.\nImportant Safety Information:\r\nGI Genius\u2122 system is intended to be used as an adjunct to colonoscopy procedures and is not intended to replace endoscopist assessment or histopathological sampling. GI Genius\u2122 system does not make any elaboration or alteration of the colonoscopy video streaming, it only overlays graphical markers.\n\nDanger: Do not use this system for any purpose other than its intended use.\nDanger: The system does not perform any diagnosis.\nCaution: The sale, distribution, and the use of the GI Genius\u2122 system are restricted to prescription use in accordance with 21 CFR 801.109.\nCaution: The device is not intended to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic device.\nCaution: The device is not intended to characterize lesions in a manner that would potentially replace biopsy sampling.\nCaution: The device is not intended to replace clinical decision-making.\nCaution: The device is not intended to be used with equipment that was not tested against during validation activities.\nCaution: The device has not been studied in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), history of CRC, or previous colonic resection. The device performance may be negatively impacted by mucosal irregularities such as background inflammation from certain underlying disease.\nCaution: Users should be aware, when using automated systems such as the GI Genius\u2122 that provide assistance in identifying suspicious lesions, that a high level of reliance may be placed on the system output, potentially leading to user complacency and a bias towards accepting the system output results, rather than using the device as intended. The device is intended to provide adjunctive information to the endoscopist who performs endoscopic evaluations with an expected high level of clinical expertise. Placing too much reliance on the system in this way may lead to an unacceptably low level of procedural oversight ('situational awareness'), sub-par evaluation of the patient, and eventual endoscopist skill degradation, following which retraining may be necessary.\nDanger: Using incompatible equipment can result in patient injury or equipment damage and makes it impossible to obtain the expected functionality.\n\nL001-03042024\nRelated content\n\n\nFive healthcare technology trends in 2024\n\nReady for the AI revolution in healthcare?\n\nRobots see the future of surgery [and it\u2019s super cool]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories published to our news archive may contain outdated information or links that are no longer active.

And below you can check out the system requirements for Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West Complete Edition System Requirements Released\nJoin Aloy as she braves the distant lands of Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, the critically-acclaimed sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn. Launching March 21st, the Complete Edition also includes Burning Shores, the story expansion that picks up after the conclusion of the main game, along with bonus content.\nExplore distant lands, fight bigger and more awe-inspiring machines, and encounter astonishing new tribes as you return to the far-future, post-apocalyptic world of Horizon. The land is dying. Vicious storms and an unstoppable blight ravage the scattered remnants of humanity, while fearsome new machines prowl their borders. Life on Earth is hurtling towards another extinction, and no one knows why.\nIt's up to Aloy to uncover the secrets behind these threats and restore order and balance to the world. Along the way, she must reunite with old friends, forge alliances with warring new factions and unravel the legacy of the ancient past \u2013 all the while trying to stay one step ahead of a seemingly undefeatable new enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 new, exclusive 4K screenshots from the forthcoming PC release of Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition\nWhen Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition is released, GeForce RTX gamers can activate DLSS 3 from day-one to multiply their performance, while those with fast enough frame rates can use DLAA to maximize their image quality. And to make gameplay even more responsive, players can enable Reflex to reduce system latency. \u00a0\nWithout DLSS Super Resolution or Frame Generation, GeForce RTX 4080 owners can use the Very High graphics preset at 4K and play at 60 FPS, per Sony\u2019s official Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition system requirements. At 1440p, using the High preset, Sony recommends a GeForce RTX 3070 for 60 FPS gameplay, and with the many scalable in-game options, cards dating back to the GeForce GTX 1650 can play at lower resolutions and detail levels.\nWith DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation, performance is substantially faster, enabling gamers to play with increased levels of detail at higher resolutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more about the PC edition of Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, watch the features trailer below, and return to GeForce.com shortly before the game\u2019s release for our Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition DLSS 3 performance charts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSons Of The Forest Available Now With DLSS 2\nEndnight Games\u2019 The Forest was an incredibly popular open-world survival and crafting game. Their critically acclaimed follow-up, Sons Of The Forest, recently exited Early Access with a massive content update.

Craft, build, and struggle to survive, alone or with friends, in this terrifying new open-world survival horror simulator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its initial Early Access launch, Sons Of The Forest has included DLSS 2 support, enabling GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate performance at the highest detail levels and resolutions.

The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world.\nMeanwhile, Broadcom\u2019s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves.\nIn this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course.\nDespite AI hype, the macro is softening\nYou\u2019d never know it from all the AI froth but the macro appears to be getting worse.\n\nEnterprise Technology Research shared the chart above earlier in the week with its private clients. It shows the expected information technology spending growth rates from more than 1,500 IT decision makers for three time periods \u2013 October 2023, January 2024 and the most recent survey in the field. Note the material drop in Q1 from 2.8% to 1.5% and more than a 100-basis-point drop in the expectations for the full-year 2024. As we\u00a0reported earlier this year, the tech spending outlook is backloaded toward the second half and is further deteriorating based on the latest data.\nBut the AI trade is broadening\nDespite the softer macro environment, we\u2019re seeing countervailing effects from investors toward clear AI beneficiaries beyond the giants. Specifically, the strong performance of the market in 2023 was narrow with just a few names powering the tech rally. Although both Nvidia and Broadcom were part of that momentum along with Microsoft and some other names, 2024 is shaping up to have much broader participation in the AI tailwind. Firms such as Ansys, Cadence, Synopsys,\u00a0Dell Technologies, Micron, IBM, Supermicro, Pure Storage, VAST Data, ServiceNow, CrowdStrike Holdings, Arm, UiPath, Lam Research and many others are benefitting from the froth around GTC24.\n\nAbove we show the recent movement post Chief Executive Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote at GTC24 for Ansys, Cadence, Synopsys and Dell, each of which got major shoutouts from Huang in his presentation. You can see they all moved up nicely and we believe it\u2019s from the combination of 1) the GTC momentum; and 2) good fundamentals, including demand outstripping supply for these firms.\nIn the case of Ansys, Cadence and Synopsys, they are critical design software providers for silicon chips. In the case of Dell, the company\u2019s supply chain leverage is putting it in a good position to secure GPUs. Its execution is throwing of cash that it\u2019s returning to investors and as well it is benefitting from the AI tailwind. And there\u2019s likely more to come from a new PC cycle that will take shape later this year.\nWe also show Cisco Systems, a company that is not considered an AI leader, despite the fact that it has a robust portfolio, which includes many AI innovations. Cisco has silicon to power AI networking,\u00a0AI in its own networking, AI in its collaboration software, and data from its recently completed Splunk acquisition and ThousandEyes to provide network intelligence data that can feed Splunk. But the macro is hurting Cisco right now as the company has disappointed investors recently.\nSnowflake (not shown above) is another company that in theory should be benefitting from AI because it houses so much critical analytic data. It has partnerships with the likes of Nvidia and it has acquired AI expertise in the form of Neeva. But investors were shaken by\u00a0Frank Slootman stepping down as CEO\u00a0and the street is waiting for Snowflake\u2019s new leader, Sridhar Ramaswamy, to prove that Snowflake is still on track.\nAI is everywhere but still is in the experimental phase within the enterprise. Our premise is that while the macro is still challenging, AI will be infused into all sectors and eventually be a rising tide for all areas of tech and beyond. However, at the moment, though the return on investment of AI is clear for consumer internet companies such as Google and Meta Platforms, the business impact for enterprise AI has not been as evident. Until it shows up in the quarterly numbers, we expect chief financial officers to remain conservative with their budget allocations.\nThe point is that the AI rally is broadening but it\u2019s still not a tide that lifts all ships. Nonetheless, a broadening of a rally signals investor concern about the valuations at leading companies. They\u2019re making the case for putting money to work with other AI beneficiaries that could give them better returns in the near term. As well, others such as the Cisco and Snowflake examples we shared will eventually benefit in our opinion. These are indicators in our view that there\u2019s still plenty of upside in this AI run. We understand it\u2019s just a matter of time before the other AI winners become highly valued and the market gets toppy. But we\u2019re not there yet, in our view.\nNvidia GTC marks an industry milestone\nGTC was a remarkable moment for our industry. The event was held in the San Jose Convention Center, a venue that was filled to the max in 2019, the last time GTC was held as an in-person event. GTC24 was far too large for this venue. In fact, the keynote took place in the SAP Center sports arena, about a mile from the main event. Rumors circulated that Jensen wanted GTC to be held at the Sphere in Las Vegas but it was booked. Perhaps next year, as clearly GTC has outgrown the coziness of San Jose.\n\nThe main venue was packed for days, with Monday seeing the largest attendance. Perhaps as many as 30,000 people attended over the course of the week, but what made GTC so important was the reach not only in the technology community but with many presenters outside tech in automotive, healthcare, financial services \u2013 virtually every industry was represented.\nA new industry platform: The tokenization of everything\nThe big takeaways \u2013 and there are many we won\u2019t touch on today \u2013 started with Jensen\u2019s keynote and his vision for the industry and what he calls accelerated computing. And the building of AI factories. The vision he put forth during the week was that a world of generated content is here. The images from his keynote he said were all simulation, not animation \u2013 and the simulations were impressive.\nHe also put forth a vision of a token economy where the computer sees tokens and these tokens can be generalized. If you can generalize, he said, then you can talk to the AI and generate images, perform gene analysis, control robotic arms and more.\nThe world\u2019s biggest GPU\nJensen said that Blackwell, its new chip named after mathematician\u00a0David Blackwell, was built for this generative AI moment. He described a reinforcement learning loop where training, learning and generation become part of the same process. And if done well and enough times, it becomes reality. He implied that this workflow would perform both inference and training and a critical enabler to Blackwell is NVLink, a high speed interconnect that is proprietary to Nvidia. He said Blackwell took three years, 25,000 people and $10 billion to create, with incredible complexity \u2013 600,000 parts and lots of software to do switching, links, cables and all the plumbing.\nHe also explained that Nvidia is not a chip company. Rather, it builds entire systems, then disaggregates them to sell to customers. This no doubt caused some stress among systems vendors.\nA new software development paradigm\nGTC24 is a developer conference first, even though that point gets lost sometimes in all the noise from the ecosystem. Jensen laid out a vision for developers showing off NIMS (Nvidia Inference Microservices), which are inference containers. As well, there\u2019s NeMo (Neural\u00a0Modules), which are models for conversational AI and a platform for developing end-to-end generative AI using automated speech recognition, natural language processing and retrieval augmented generation at very high performance.\nAnd he discussed the AI Foundry, which packages all this technology into systems and essentially changes the way data centers are built.\nHe also spent a lot of time showing off Omniverse\u00a0a platform of APIs, services, and SDKs that allow developers to build digital representations of a business and its workflows using generative AI-enabled tools. Jensen\u00a0talked about digital twins at length and had robots on stage with him.\nIn a private meeting with Jensen, he told us that within eight to 10 years, robots will be generally fully functioning. And he said this will be done with \u201cjust a bunch of tokens.\u201d Think tokenizing of movement. He said we have lots of data and there\u2019s a finite vocabulary around what various human movements like walking, sprinting, skipping, throwing, hugging and the like look like. And this can be simulated with AI \u2014 and done so very accurately by being tokenized and made generative.\nA key, he said, was to be able to ground Omniverse in the laws of physics and he described a cycle of imitate>learn>adapt>generalize>reinforce and ground in the laws of physics.\nEcosystem enablement\nThe ecosystem was on full display at GTC24. Virtually every company with a play in AI was basking in the AI glow. Hence the broadening of the AI tailwind we\u2019re seeing post-GTC.\nYou left the event truly believing we saw proof of a new era emerging and coming into full swing. The days of Moore\u2019s Law driving industry innovation are over. A new performance curve has emerged and new styles of computing will dominate virtually all sectors for the next decade.\nThis was the strong feeling one gets when assessing the impact of GTC 2024.\nMeanwhile, Broadcom continues to execute on a differentiated AI strategy\nA different but compelling AI vision was put forth by Broadcom at its investor event.\n\nBroadcom held its first-ever investor day at its facilities in San Jose on Wednesday morning, perfectly timed to capitalize on the GTC24 momentum and position the company for investors. It was attended by both buy-side and sell-side analysts and only a few industry analysts such as ourselves.\nThis was Charlie Kawwas\u2019 show, designed to educate the investment community on Broadcom\u2019s unique approach to the market. We learned a lot from the president of Broadcom\u2019s Semiconductor Solutions Group about its strategy, philosophy, technology, execution ethos, engineering talent and we saw demos of some of the most leading edge silicon technology on the planet.\nBroadcom has 26 divisions or P&Ls and 17 of them are in the semiconductor group. The semiconductor group is a roughly $30 billion revenue business, growing in the double digits. The group spends $3 billion annually on R&D.\nKawwas and his team took us through the history of how Broadcom came to be, with roots in Bell Labs, HP, LSI Logic, LSI Avago, Broadcom, Brocade and more recently software assets such as CA, Symantec and of course VMware.\nBroadcom\u2019s unconventional strategy\nKawwas explained\u00a0the company\u2019s unique three-pronged strategy shown below.\n\nBroadcom doesn\u2019t chase hockey stick markets to try to ride the steep part of an S-surve. Rather, it looks for durable markets with sustainable franchises that have a decade or more runway. In those markets, it goes for technology leadership and it executes to a firm plan. With AI, Broadcom\u00a0just happened to catch a big wave\u00a0and is exceedingly well-positioned.\nSo this is a nice Powerpoint, but what was impressive to us is that the five presenters coming after Kawwas each demonstrated: 1) a deep understanding of their markets and the history of their businesses; 2) technology\u00a0leadership within their division, showing us when they entered the market, how they were first with innovations, their technology roadmaps and; 3) evidence of execution.\nThe proof points were many from AI networks presented by Ram Velaga, server interconnects by Jas Tremblay, optical interconnects from Near Margalit, foundational technologies such as\u00a0SerDes\u00a0that are shared across the P&Ls from Vijay Janapaty, and custom AI accelerators presented by Frank Ostojic.\nA new custom silicon customer: Is No. 3 ByteDance?\nThe biggest news from the event and part of the reason why the stock popped after Investor Day \u2014 in addition to the credibility of the presentations and the GTC24 momentum \u2013 was the announcement of a third custom silicon customer.\nCustomer No. 1 is Google in our opinion. It has been a custom silicon customer of Broadcom for 10 years. Custom customer No. 2, we believe, is Meta, a customer for the past four years and one where Broadcom CEO Hock Tan sits on the board.\nWe were all speculating on which customer is No. 3. We think it\u2019s ByteDance, but this wasn\u2019t disclosed. Kawwas was asked in the Q&A if its technologies are restricted from selling to China and his answer was currently there are no restrictions on selling its technology. So ByteDance, the owner of Tik Tok, can\u2019t be ruled out.\nBut as well, we know that ByteDance is an advanced customer of Broadcom. It has a large network and has embraced Broadcom\u2019s\u00a0on-chip, neural-network inference engine, giving it programmability and flexibility. It also is a large consumer-oriented social network that can get fast ROI from using more custom versus merchant silicon.\n\nFurther strengthening our\u00a0belief that customer No. 3 is ByteDance came from a two other key takeaways from this discussion that further explain the value of custom silicon.\nConsumer markets drive innovation ahead of enterprise\n\nFirst, the business case for consumer AI at companies such as Google and Meta are is very strong. The bigger the AI clusters they can build, the better AI they have, the better they can serve content to customers and the more ad revenue they generate. ByteDance is a leader in AI with perhaps the best algorithm and it would make sense that custom silicon would further support its mission.\nThe second point is that the consumer internet giants have very specific workloads, and if you can customize silicon for those workloads, you can significantly cut costs and power. Power is the No. 1 problem at scale and these internet giants are scaling up. So if custom silicon can save 80 watts per chip and these internet companies use hundreds of thousands or millions of chips\u2026 well, you do the math.\n\nFor these reasons, we think custom customer No. 3 is ByteDance. Could it be Amazon, Apple or Tesla? Maybe\u2026 but we think ByteDance makes the most sense. And the reason this is important is because these are durable customers with long lifecycles and a highly differentiated and very difficult to displace business.\nThese custom customers are AI-driven and will contribute to Broadcom\u2019s AI revenue. The company increased its AI contribution forecast saying that 35% of its semiconductor revenues will come from AI in 2024. That\u2019s a 10% increase from previous forecasts and its up from less than 5% in 2021.\nIn 2024, 35% of Broadcom\u2019s silicon revenue will come from AI workloads.\nWe don\u2019t make GPUs\u2026.We make the stuff that makes XPUs and HBMs work\nThere\u2019s so much to unpack from the Broadcom meeting. We have almost 90 slides of content and multiple pages of notes from the event. But one other key point we want to leave you with is shown here.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s premise is that we\u2019re moving from a world that is CPU-centric to one that is connectivity-centric. The emergence of alternative processors beyond the CPU such as the GPU, NPU, LPU \u2013 the XPUs, if you will \u2013 requires high-speed connections between them. And that is Broadcom\u2019s specialty.\nAnd the power of its business model is shown above. This is an example of a type of system needed to support AI workloads. Broadcom technologies are shown on the right and the numbers show where they fit in the packaging. The company is essentially surrounding the AI infrastructure.\nImagine Broadcom tech at scale\nBelow is a different picture of this dynamic with a configuration that scales up and out to\u00a0many clusters. Broadcom\u2019s technology is shown in the red and the yellow optics that connect all the various components of a system, from the spine, top-of-rack switching, NICs, PCIe innovation and the like. It has a massive total available market beyond that GPU and CPU that is a very difficult market in which to participate.\n\nAnother key takeaway which was shown on all of Broadcom\u2019s slides \u2013 Kawwas\u2019 mantra \u2013 Open, Scalable, Power-efficient.\nBroadcom is focused on open technology standards. Two examples are PCIe and Ethernet. There was a nuanced but interesting tidbit shared\u00a0by Jas Tremblay about Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s giant GPU. The southbound connectivity of Blackwell is proprietary NVLink, but the northbound connection is PCIe. Nvidia\u2019s highly proprietary architecture is built around Infiniband from the Mellanox acquisition. But even Nvidia must play in the open standards world.\nThe southbound connectivity of Blackwell is proprietary NVLink but the northbound connection is PCIe. \u2013 Jas Tremblay, GM Data Center Solutions Group, Broadcom\nNvidia is Broadcom\u2019s fastest-growing customer\nDespite the tension between Nvidia\u2019s proprietary approach to network connectivity and Broadcom\u2019s embrace of Ethernet, Kawwas highlighted that Broadcom has a great relationship with Nvidia and Nvidia is its fastest-growing customer.\nSo you can begin to see how compelling Broadcom\u2019s business model is because it sells to consumer internet companies, device manufacturers such as Apple, hyperscalers, enterprise players such as Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the most important company in AI right now, Nvidia \u2014 which in some ways makes Broadcom as important to the growth of the industry.\nAnother clear takeaway is that Broadcom does the really hard silicon work that others can\u2019t do. The example given was many folks can ski the green trails but the double blacks and extreme skiing with warning signs and skeletons \u2013 Broadcom does really well but that\u2019s a huge barrier to entry.\nThere\u2019s so much more we could talk about and we will share more over the coming weeks and months as we digest this material. Especially in the Infiniband-versus-Ethernet discussion, which was fascinating \u2013 Jensen saying Ethernet is essentially useless for AI and Broadcom countering with many proof points of AI leaders such as Meta, Google and others adopting Ethernet.\nThe AI outlook\n\nWe\u2019ll close with the following key points:\n\nThe AI tailwind is broadening and is especially evident for those firms seeing unprecedented AI demand.\nOther firms are more susceptible to the macro right now and will have to prove their AI innovations and execution to participate in the updraft.\nNvidia and Broadcom have radically different strategies but both have sustainable moats with long runways.\nThere\u2019s lots of discussion on training vs. inference and how Nvidia will play as costs come down. Broadcom will 100% participate in both.\nConsumer AI ROI is clear. Consumer markets always lead and eventually spill into the enterprise. AI ROI must be tangible for the macro headwinds to subside.\n\nWill 2024 be the year of AI ROI in the enterprise, the way it has been for years in consumer internet markets such as search and social? We think perhaps in the second half of this year, enterprises will start to see ROI on their AI investments, but 80% of organizations are still firmly in the experimentation phase.\u00a0It\u2019s more likely AI ROI is a 2025 story where enough value is thrown off from investments to gain share back into new AI projects that will ideally drive productivity growth and fulfill the promise of AI.\nFor now, keep experimenting, finding those high-value uses cases and stay ahead of the competition in your industry.\nKeep in touch\nThanks to Alex Myerson and Ken Shifman on production, podcasts and media workflows for Breaking Analysis.

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  From designing dream cars to customizing clothing, 3D product configurators are ringing in a new era of hyper-personalization that will benefit retailers and consumers.\nDevelopers are delivering innovative virtual product experiences and automated personalization using Universal Scene Description (aka OpenUSD), NVIDIA RTX technologies from NVIDIA Omniverse software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs), and generative AI from NVIDIA Edify models.\nTogether, these technologies enable developers to create configurator applications that deliver physically accurate, photoreal digital twins of products, revolutionizing the way brands personalize buyer journeys at unprecedented scale.\nFor example, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 3DEXCITE brand is adopting Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable interoperability with generative AI services, such as Shutterstock\u2019s Edify3D or Edify 360, directly inside its web-based application.\nBy using NVIDIA Edify-powered models, trained by Shutterstock, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes can generate stunning 3D environments from text prompts to instantly personalize scenes representing physically accurate products. And with Omniverse APIs, the company can supercharge the web-based app with real-time ray-traced rendering.\n\nMany other developers are also building 3D product configurator software and solutions with NVIDIA Omniverse SDKs and APIs.\nCGI studio Katana has developed a content creation application, COATCreate, used by manufacturers such as Nissan, that allows marketing assets to be staged and created faster with product digital twins. COATCreate also enables users to view and customize the digital twin while wearing an Apple Vision Pro headset, unlocking real-time ray-traced extended reality experiences.\n\nBrickland, another CGI studio, is developing real-time virtual experiences that allow users to customize clothing by choosing from predefined parameters such as color and material. Through their Digitex initiative, Brickland is expanding into digital textures and allowing consumers to visualize and interact with extreme levels of detail in their 3D assets thanks to RTX real-time rendering\nConfigit connected its powerful configurator logic tool Configit Ace to Omniverse and OpenUSD by streamlining the management of the complex rules system behind the creation of configurators and combining it with the rendering capabilities of Omniverse and RTX. This allows for rapid creation of articulated product configurators and enables the configurator developers to power real-time ray-traced rendering in their solutions.\n\nWPP has developed a content engine that harnesses OpenUSD and AI to enable creative teams to produce high-quality commercial content faster, more efficiently and at scale while remaining aligned with a client\u2019s brand.\nMedia.Monks has developed an AI-centric professional managed service that leverages Omniverse called Monks.Flow, which helps brands virtually explore different customizable product designs and unlock scale and hyper-personalization across any customer journey.\nAccenture Song, the world\u2019s largest tech-powered creative group, is using Omniverse SDKs to generate marketing content for Defender vehicles. Using it with the Edify-powered generative AI microservice, Accenture Song is enabling the creation of cinematic 3D environments via conversational prompts.\nProduct Digital Twins in the Era of Industrial Digitalization\nForecasts indicate that consumer purchases, including high-value items like vehicles and luxury goods, will increasingly take place online in the coming decade. 3D product digital twins and automated personalization with generative AI serve as invaluable tools for brands to showcase their products and enhance customer engagement in the changing retail landscape.\n3D configurators provide tangible benefits for businesses, including increased average selling prices, reduced return rates and stronger brand loyalty. Once a digital twin is built, it can serve many purposes and be updated to meet shifting consumer preferences with minimal time, cost and effort.\n\nCreating a 3D Product Configurator\nThe process of creating a 3D product configurator begins with harnessing OpenUSD\u2019s powerful composition engine and interoperability. These features enable developers to create dynamic, interactive experiences that accurately reflect the nuances of each product.\nTeams can also integrate generative AI technologies into OpenUSD-based product configurators using NVIDIA Omniverse APIs to enhance the realism and customization options available to users. By leveraging AI, configurators can intelligently adapt to user inputs, offering personalized recommendations and dynamically adjusting product configurations in real time. And with NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network , high-quality, real-time viewports can be embedded into web applications so consumers can browse products in full fidelity, on nearly any device.\nThe possibilities for 3D product configurators are virtually limitless, applicable across a wide range of industries and use cases.\nTo start, get NVIDIA Omniverse and follow along with a tutorial series.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | Retail \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It can ease the handling of complex datasets, facilitate collaboration and enable seamless interoperability between 3D applications.\nThe latest news and demos from NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference that ran last week, put on display the power developers gain from NVIDIA Omniverse \u2014 a platform of application programming interfaces (APIs) and software development kits (SDKs) that enable them to build 3D pipelines, tools, applications and services.\n\nNewly announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs, coming first to Microsoft Azure, allow developers to send their OpenUSD industrial scenes from content-creation applications to the NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network.\nSuch a workflow was showcased in a demo featuring an interactive car configurator application, developed by computer-generated-imagery studio Katana using Omniverse, streamed in full fidelity to an Apple Vision Pro\u2019s high-resolution display. A designer wearing the Vision Pro toggled through paint and trim options, and even entered the vehicle.\n\nIn a separate demo, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes showcased, using its 3DEXCITE portfolio, a powerful web-based application for 3D data preparation supercharged with NVIDIA AI and Omniverse Cloud APIs to deliver new generative storytelling capabilities.\nOpenUSD also played a part in the announcement of NVIDIA\u2019s latest AI supercomputer, a powerful cluster based on the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 liquid-cooled system, which was showcased as a digital twin in Omniverse.\nEngineers unified and visualized multiple computer-aided design datasets with full physical accuracy and photorealism using OpenUSD through the Cadence Reality digital twin platform, powered by Omniverse APIs. The technologies together provided a powerful computing platform for developing OpenUSD-based 3D tools, workflows and applications.\n\nSiemens announced it has integrated OpenUSD into its Xcelerator platform applications via Omniverse Cloud APIs, enabling its customers to unify their 3D data and services in digital twins with physically based rendering.\nA demo showcased how ship manufacturer HD Hyundai used Siemens\u2019 Teamcenter X, which is part of Xcelerator, to design digital twins of complex engineering projects, delivering accelerated collaboration, minimized workflow waste, time and cost savings, and reduced manufacturing defects.\n\nOpenUSD Ecosystem Updates on Replay\nThe latest OpenUSD ecosystem updates shared at GTC include:\n\nAnsys is adopting OpenUSD and Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable data interoperability and NVIDIA RTX visualization in technologies such as Ansys AVxcelerate for autonomous vehicles, Ansys Perceive EM for 6G simulation, and NVIDIA-accelerated solvers such as Ansys Fluent.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes is using OpenUSD, Omniverse Cloud APIs and Shutterstock 3D AI Services for generative storytelling in 3DEXCITE applications.\nContinental is developing an OpenUSD-based digital twin platform to optimize factory operations and speed time to market.\nHexagon is integrating reality-capture sensors and digital-reality platforms with OpenUSD and Omniverse Cloud APIs for hyperrealistic simulation and visualization.\nMedia.Monks is adopting Omniverse for a generative AI- and OpenUSD-enabled content-creation pipeline for scalable hyper-personalization.\nMicrosoft is integrating Omniverse Cloud APIs with Microsoft Power BI, so factory operators can see real-time factory data overlaid on a 3D digital twin to speed up production.\nRockwell Automation is using OpenUSD and Omniverse Cloud APIs for RTX-enabled visualization in industrial automation and digital transformation.\nTrimble is enabling interactive NVIDIA Omniverse RTX viewers with Trimble model data using OpenUSD and Omniverse Cloud APIs.\nWistron is building OpenUSD-based digital twins of NVIDIA DGX and HGX factories using custom software developed with Omniverse SDKs and APIs.\nWPP is expanding its Omniverse Cloud-based OpenUSD and generative AI content-generation engine to the retail and consumer packaged goods sector.\n\nGet Plugged In to the World of OpenUSD\nSeveral GTC sessions expanded on the latest OpenUSD advancements.

Systems synthetically generating data will have greater capacity to continuously learn, infer, and imagine. Instead of only instantly answering questions, forthcoming AI systems will also have the ability to think critically through problems over longer periods of time.\u201cIn the future, the way you interact with AI will be very different\u201d from what can be done with ChatGPT and other AI models today, said Huang in a keynote question-and-answer session led by John Shoven, a SIEPR senior fellow, emeritus; and the Charles R. Schwab Professor of Economics, emeritus, in Stanford\u2019s School of Humanities and Sciences.But does this mean AI technology will be able to mimic the human mind? Huang said he wasn\u2019t sure. There needs to be a consensus about what it means to say AI has achieved human intelligence.In order to have true artificial general intelligence, he said, \u201cyou need to know what the definition of success is.\u201dThe gift of pain and suffering\n\n \n\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang and SIEPR's John Shoven get ready to take the stage together at the 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit.\n\nHaving co-founded Nvidia more than 30 years ago, Huang now finds himself at the center of the tech universe. His company, whose market value hit $2 trillion last month (after reaching $1 trillion the previous June), has rocketed thanks to its sophisticated and hugely expensive semiconductor chips and its estimated market share of more than 80 percent in AI chips.\u201cWe sell the world\u2019s first quarter-million-dollar chip,\u201d Huang noted, referring to Nvidia\u2019s powerful graphical processing unit system that weighs 70 pounds, consists of 35,000 parts and has the computing capacity of a data center.During his Summit appearance, Huang regaled attendees with his insights and now-familiar deadpan humor. Asked about his signature outfit of black leather jacket, black shirt, and black pants, Huang said they are among the few pieces of clothing that don\u2019t make him itch.When asked his advice for Stanford students aspiring to be successful entrepreneurs, Huang talked about the importance of low expectations and high resilience. Greatness, he said, comes from smart people who have suffered from setbacks. This is why, at Nvidia, he talks openly about pain and suffering \u201cwith great glee.\u201d\u201cFor all of you Stanford students,\u201d he said, \u201cI wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering.\u201dWatch the full discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHighlights of the 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News Topics\n\n2024 Summit\nInnovation and Technology\nWork\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Large-scale investment in research needed to maintain US agriculture\n\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025\n\n\n        SIEPR Senior Fellow David Lobell examines how U.S. agriculture productivity has been declining amid impacts of climate change and estimates the public R&D needed to reverse course.\n      \nResearch HighlightEnergy and EnvironmentTaxes and Public Spending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Guido Imbens named director of Stanford Data Science\n\n\n\nMarch 7, 2025\n\n\n        The Nobel laureate and SIEPR Senior Fellow will lead a community of faculty, students, scholars, and staff passionate about data science research and educational opportunities.\n      \nAwards & AppointmentsEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u2018Living off the land\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean what it used to \n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2025\n\n\n        The threat of cyberwarfare is more real than ever.

QA team members Alyssa Ruiz and DaJuan McDaniel cheer them on.\nA Competitive Spirit\nPerez-Frangie has competed for 15 years in a series of fighting game titles, including Marvel vs. Capcom, Killer Instinct and Mortal Kombat. He was part of the Evil Geniuses esports organization when he joined NVIDIA almost a decade ago but now plays without a sponsor so he can enjoy more family time.\nHe\u2019s played against Chea in esports events for years, and they\u2019re just as competitive in the office as in the stadiums.\n\u201cEven when we\u2019re in the test environment, when we\u2019re looking for bugs, we are competitive,\u201d Perez-Frangie said. \u201cBut Miky stays calm \u2014 he was a teacher, so he can put everyone in their place.\u201d\nChea\u2019s days teaching kindergarten through eighth grade in Fresno, California, are behind him, but the coaching aspect of his current gaming-related role reminds him of the classroom \u2014 a place to share insights and takeaways.\nAs new games are released and older ones updated, \u201cthe hardware and software stack needs to work in harmony,\u201d Chea said. \u201cOur pro gaming team is the last line of defense to ensure our customers have the best gaming experience possible.\u201d\nThe QA team gathers to check out a new game.\nQA team member DaJuan \u201cShroomed\u201d McDaniel is a top-ranked Super Smash Bros. Melee player whose signature characters are Sheik and Marth. He\u2019s also widely considered to be the best Dr. Mario player of all time.\n\u201cBeing a competitive gamer, visual fidelity is so important,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cWe can see and feel visual anomalies, frame discrepancies, general latency and anything that\u2019s off in ways that others won\u2019t see.\u201d\nMcDaniel playing \u201cCyberpunk 2077.\u201d\nA Winning Formula\nAlyssa Ruiz joined the QA team a year ago, initially testing drivers as part of the pro gaming team before switching to testing NVIDIA DLSS, a suite of neural rendering techniques that use deep learning to improve image quality and performance.\nIntroduced to gaming by her brothers through Halo 3, she later dedicated hours to Fortnite before deciding to stream the gameplay directly from her console. She posted the content to TikTok and began playing in online tournaments. By then, her game of choice was Riot Games\u2019 Valorant.\n\u201cThe game has a large female player base with visually appealing graphics and an engrossing storyline,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can be more complex than a fighting game because it relies on a combination of abilities with strategies. It\u2019s also a team game, so if someone isn\u2019t pulling their weight, it\u2019s a loss for all of us.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not unlike the team dynamic in the office.\nPerez-Frangie, Ruiz, Chea and McDaniel.\nEach member brings their own specialties to the testing environment, where they\u2019re using their keen eyes to scrutinize DLSS technologies.\nTheir acute awareness of game latency and image fidelity \u2014 honed through hundreds of hours of gameplay \u2014 means the team can achieve better test coverage all around.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very competitive, but there\u2019s a real diversity that contributes to a stronger team,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cAnd we all get along really well.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Trustworthy AI initiatives recognize the real-world effects that AI can have on people and society, and aim to channel that power responsibly for positive change.\nWhat Is Trustworthy AI?\nTrustworthy AI is an approach to AI development that prioritizes safety and transparency for those who interact with it. Developers of trustworthy AI understand that no model is perfect, and take steps to help customers and the general public understand how the technology was built, its intended use cases and its limitations.\nIn addition to complying with privacy and consumer protection laws, trustworthy AI models are tested for safety, security and mitigation of unwanted bias. They\u2019re also transparent \u2014 providing information such as accuracy benchmarks or a description of the training dataset \u2014 to various audiences including regulatory authorities, developers and consumers.\nPrinciples of Trustworthy AI\nTrustworthy AI principles are foundational to NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end AI development. They have a simple goal: to enable trust and transparency in AI and support the work of partners, customers and developers.\nPrivacy: Complying With Regulations, Safeguarding Data\nAI is often described as data hungry. Often, the more data an algorithm is trained on, the more accurate its predictions.\nBut data has to come from somewhere. To develop trustworthy AI, it\u2019s key to consider not just what data is legally available to use, but what data is socially responsible to use.\nDevelopers of AI models that rely on data such as a person\u2019s image, voice, artistic work or health records should evaluate whether individuals have provided appropriate consent for their personal information to be used in this way.\nFor institutions like hospitals and banks, building AI models means balancing the responsibility of keeping patient or customer data private while training a robust algorithm. NVIDIA has created technology that enables federated learning, where researchers develop AI models trained on data from multiple institutions without confidential information leaving a company\u2019s private servers.\nNVIDIA DGX systems and NVIDIA FLARE software have enabled several federated learning projects in healthcare and financial services, facilitating secure collaboration by multiple data providers on more accurate, generalizable AI models for medical image analysis and fraud detection.\nSafety and Security: Avoiding Unintended Harm, Malicious Threats\nOnce deployed, AI systems have real-world impact, so it\u2019s essential they perform as intended to preserve user safety.\nThe freedom to use publicly available AI algorithms creates immense possibilities for positive applications, but also means the technology can be used for unintended purposes.\nTo help mitigate risks, NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails keeps AI language models on track by allowing enterprise developers to set boundaries for their applications. Topical guardrails ensure that chatbots stick to specific subjects. Safety guardrails set limits on the language and data sources the apps use in their responses. Security guardrails seek to prevent malicious use of a large language model that\u2019s connected to third-party applications or application programming interfaces.\nNVIDIA Research is working with the DARPA-run SemaFor program to help digital forensics experts identify AI-generated images. Last year, researchers published a novel method for addressing social bias using ChatGPT. They\u2019re also creating methods for avatar fingerprinting \u2014 a way to detect if someone is using an AI-animated likeness of another individual without their consent.\nTo protect data and AI applications from security threats, NVIDIA H100 and H200 Tensor Core GPUs are built with confidential computing, which ensures sensitive data is protected while in use, whether deployed on premises, in the cloud or at the edge. NVIDIA Confidential Computing uses hardware-based security methods to ensure unauthorized entities can\u2019t view or modify data or applications while they\u2019re running \u2014 traditionally a time when data is left vulnerable.\nTransparency: Making AI Explainable\nTo create a trustworthy AI model, the algorithm can\u2019t be a black box \u2014 its creators, users and stakeholders must be able to understand how the AI works to trust its results.\nTransparency in AI is a set of best practices, tools and design principles that helps users and other stakeholders understand how an AI model was trained and how it works. Explainable AI, or XAI, is a subset of transparency covering tools that inform stakeholders how an AI model makes certain predictions and decisions.\nTransparency and XAI are crucial to establishing trust in AI systems, but there\u2019s no universal solution to fit every kind of AI model and stakeholder. Finding the right solution involves a systematic approach to identify who the AI affects, analyze the associated risks and implement effective mechanisms to provide information about the AI system.\nRetrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, is a technique that advances AI transparency by connecting generative AI services to authoritative external databases, enabling models to cite their sources and provide more accurate answers. NVIDIA is helping developers get started with a RAG workflow that uses the NVIDIA NeMo framework for developing and customizing generative AI models.\nNVIDIA is also part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium, or AISIC, to help create tools and standards for responsible AI development and deployment. As a consortium member, NVIDIA will promote trustworthy AI by leveraging best practices for implementing AI model transparency.\nAnd on NVIDIA\u2019s hub for accelerated software, NGC, model cards offer detailed information about how each AI model works and was built. NVIDIA\u2019s Model Card ++ format describes the datasets, training methods and performance measures used, licensing information, as well as specific ethical considerations.\nNondiscrimination: Minimizing Bias\nAI models are trained by humans, often using data that is limited by size, scope and diversity. To ensure that all people and communities have the opportunity to benefit from this technology, it\u2019s important to reduce unwanted bias in AI systems.\nBeyond following government guidelines and antidiscrimination laws, trustworthy AI developers mitigate potential unwanted bias by looking for clues and patterns that suggest an algorithm is discriminatory, or involves the inappropriate use of certain characteristics. Racial and gender bias in data are well-known, but other considerations include cultural bias and bias introduced during data labeling. To reduce unwanted bias, developers might incorporate different variables into their models.\nSynthetic datasets offer one solution to reduce unwanted bias in training data used to develop AI for autonomous vehicles and robotics. If data used to train self-driving cars underrepresents uncommon scenes such as extreme weather conditions or traffic accidents, synthetic data can help augment the diversity of these datasets to better represent the real world, helping improve AI accuracy.\nNVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, a framework built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform for creating and operating 3D pipelines and virtual worlds, helps developers set up custom pipelines for synthetic data generation. And by integrating the NVIDIA TAO Toolkit for transfer learning with Innotescus, a web platform for curating unbiased datasets for computer vision, developers can better understand dataset patterns and biases to help address statistical imbalances.\nLearn more about trustworthy AI on NVIDIA.com and the NVIDIA Blog.

So, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a very, very big GPU,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at a developers conference in California, referring to the graphics processors that are vital in the creation of generative AI.Recommended Stories list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4After success of BTS and Parasite, South Korea woos digital nomadslist 2 of 4Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 754list 3 of 4Biden warns Netanyahu against \u2018mistake\u2019 of invading Rafahlist 4 of 4How the uncommitted vote against Biden\u2019s Gaza policy is going nationalend of list\nThe event, dubbed the \u201cAI Woodstock\u201d by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, has become a can\u2019t-miss date on big tech\u2019s calendar due to Nvidia\u2019s singular role in the AI revolution that has taken the world by storm since the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\u201cI hope you realise this is not a concert, this is a developers\u2019 conference,\u201d Huang joked as he took the stage in a packed arena usually reserved for ice hockey games and concerts.\nNvidia\u2019s powerful GPU chips and software are an integral ingredient in the creation of generative AI, with rivals like AMD or Intel still struggling to match the power and efficiency of the company\u2019s blockbuster H100 product, launched in 2022. Advertisement \nApple, Microsoft and Amazon have also developed chips with AI in mind but for now are stuck trying to get their hands on Nvidia\u2019s coveted products to deliver on their own AI promises.\nThat linchpin role in the AI revolution has seen Nvidia\u2019s share price rise by roughly 250 percent over the last 12 months, propelling the company above Amazon when measured by market capitalisation, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\nNot letting up, Nvidia told the audience of developers and tech executives it was releasing an even more powerful processor and accompanying software, on a platform called Blackwell \u2013 named after David Blackwell, the first Black academic inducted into the National Academy of Science.\nBlackwell GPUs were AI \u201csuperchips\u201d four times as fast as the previous generation when training AI models, Nvidia said.\n\u201cThe rate at which computing is advancing is insane,\u201d Huang said.\nThey would also deliver 25 times the energy efficiency, Nvidia said, a key claim when the creation of AI is criticised for its ravenous needs for energy and natural resources when compared with more conventional computing.\nUnlike its rivals Intel, Micron and Texas Instruments, Nvidia, like AMD, does not manufacture its own chips, but uses subcontractors, mainly the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nGiven the geopolitical concerns with Taiwan and China, this could be a potential weak spot, and the US has banned Nvidia from sending its most powerful chips to Chinese companies.\nNvidia also announced other AI developments, including a platform for training humanoid robots. Advertisement \nProject Gr00t, which Nvidia said was not named after the Guardians of the Galaxy movie character Groot, was described as the \u201cworld\u2019s first human foundation model\u201d.\nGr00t-powered robots will be designed to understand what people say and mimic people\u2019s movements, learning from experience how to interact with the world, according to Nvidia.\nThe models \u201cwill enable a robot to learn from a handful of human demonstrations so it can help with everyday tasks and emulate human movement just by observing us\u201d, Nvidia said.\nNvidia said it was also working with Apple to put AI capabilities into the newly-released Vision Pro spatial computing gear.\nThe collaboration comes as Apple is under pressure to show it is not being left behind by Amazon, Google, Meta and OpenAI when it comes to artificial intelligence.\nNvidia\u00a0also unveiled the Earth-2 Cloud Platform\u00a0for predicting climate change, using simulation by AI supercomputers.\nSource: AFPaj-logoaj-logoaj-logo Sponsored Content  Advertisement AboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usStay ConnectedNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss\u00a9 2025 Al Jazeera Media Network\n\n"

The awards recognize partners who are selling Nvidia\u2019s products and services at a fast clip and making major investments with the chip designer.\n[Related: The 21 Hottest Products At Nvidia GTC 2024]\nNvidia honored the partners a day after the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company revealed its plan to defend and grow its dominant position in the AI computing space with a new set of significantly more powerful chips and systems along with software meant to accelerate development.\nIn an exclusive interview with CRN, Nvidia Americas Channel Chief Craig Weinstein said the 13 award-winning partners represent fast-growing AI businesses that \u201cdeeply understand\u201d Nvidia\u2019s full-stack platform, which includes GPUs, CPUs and data processing units as well as servers like the DGX systems and software and services like Nvidia AI Enterprise.\n\u201cThey are not just leading with GPUs. Thiwins is a conversation around Nvidia software architecture, Nvidia hardware architecture [and] the way that intersects with unique and important ISVs [independent software vendors] that deliver unique capabilities to industries that we know are adopting [such solutions],\u201d said Weinstein, vice president of the Americas partner organization.\nThe partners also understand how Nvidia\u2019s full stack of products and services intersect with the company\u2019s ecosystem of server OEMs, like Dell Technologies, Lenovo and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, according to Weinstein. This extends to Nvidia\u2019s alliances with cloud service providers, too, which include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\n\u201cI would say these partners represent probably the most robust view of accelerated computing in any form it may take in the history that I've been with this company,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cAnd the level of investment taking place is something that I've never seen in my career.\u201d\nThese partners in turn have experienced \u201csignificant growth\u201d for their AI infrastructure and services practices, which involves doing business not just with Nvidia but also with OEMs, ISVs and other kinds of ecosystem partners, according to the channel chief.\n\u201cWhat they'll tell you is that when AI and generative AI and the use cases and the business opportunities present themselves at a customer, their wallet share in that opportunity goes up significantly,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cIt may be the most significant uptrend that they've seen in their history as being a solution integrator or a solution provider, which creates incremental growth.\u201d\nAn executive at three-time award-winner Mark III Systems told CRN that his company managed to reach the top again because of its focus on building centers of excellence around fields like AI and high-performance computing to help his customers succeed.\n\u201cWe've built this organization, I would say, the hard way over the last eight years. That's not only with the ability with data center engineers and GPUs but also folks that engage with builders, to get them to be educated and use the platform,\u201d said Andy Lin, who is CTO and vice president of strategy and innovation of the Houston, Texas-based system integrator.\nChristopher Cyr, CTO of first-time winner Sterling, credited his company for focusing on building a relationship with Nvidia rather than seeking a quick way to make money.\n\u201cIt was really focusing on the future. It was really knowing the work that we would put in with all of our Sterling teammates and all of our Nvidia teammates was going to pay off,\u201d said Cyr, whose North Sioux City, S.D.-based company ranked No. 57 on CRN\u2019s 2023 Solution Provider 500 list.\nWhat follows are the names of the recipients for this year\u2019s 14 Nvidia Partner Network awards for the Americas, which awards they won and why they received the honors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLambda\nTop Executive: Stephen Balaban, CEO and co-founder\nRepeat winner Lambda won Nvidia\u2019s inaugural award for AI Excellence Partner of the Year.\nThe GPU cloud service provider and system integrator was recognized \u201cfor its dedication to providing end-to-end AI solutions featuring Nvidia accelerated computing and Nvidia AI Enterprise across Nvidia DGX and Lambda Cloud.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Wide Technology\nTop Executive: Jim Kavanaugh, CEO and Co-founder\nNo. 9 on CRN\u2019s 2023 Solution Provider 500 list, repeat winner World Wide Technology won Nvidia\u2019s inaugural award for Enterprise Partner of the Year.\nThe St. Louis, Mo.-based company received this commendation for \u201cits leadership, dedication and expertise in advancing the adoption of AI with Nvidia\u2019s portfolio of purpose-built systems, data center networking, software and accelerated computing solutions across machine learning, digital twins, Nvidia Omniverse and visualization,\u201d according to Nvidia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverge Technology Solutions\nTop Executive: Shaun Maine, President and CEO\nNo. 30 on CRN\u2019s 2023 Solution Provider 500 list, Converge Technology Solutions took two awards: Canadian Partner of the Year and Networking Partner of the Year.\nThe Gatineau, Quebec-based company received the Canadian Partner of the Year Award for its \u201cdedication and expertise in NVIDIA DGX systems and for its Canadian customer support services, leveraging training courses from NVIDIA, to further industry knowledge of the NVIDIA software stack,\u201d according to Nvidia.\nIt received the networking award for its \u201cexpertise in NVIDIA high-performance networking solutions to support state-of-the-art accelerated computing deployments,\u201d the GPU designer added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDW\nTop Executive: Christine A.

Seventeen years later, he\u2019s a senior manager of hardware engineering with the GPU hardware memory subsystem group based in Bangalore.\n\u201cThe stars aligned the day I accepted the offer from NVIDIA, and now I\u2019m doing my life\u2019s work,\u201d Chandrasekaran said. \u201cI still get to make chips \u2014 just a different kind.\u201d\n\nWhat led you to NVIDIA?\u00a0\n\nI knew I wanted to do something in the field of semiconductors, a lesser-known industry in India at the time. When I first heard of NVIDIA through a campus placement in 2006, the company was mostly recognized for its graphics cards and chipsets. NVIDIA had a cool vibe and was all the buzz on campus \u2014 plus, the company had a high bar in hiring and a competitive package. I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019ve faced?\n\nMy first silicon bug in a new module during my first year. It wasn\u2019t an easy time for me \u2014 there was a massive sense of guilt and too many things running through my mind on why the bug was missed.\nHowever, the \u201cone team\u201d culture at NVIDIA was just incredible. My manager and team members were working round the clock to pull data and figure out workarounds and tradeoffs. Different teams chipped in and shared their experience with resolving similar problems. The support from the whole group \u2014 from isolating the issue to closure \u2014 was quite remarkable.\nOur CEO, Jensen Huang, has a well-known saying: \u201cNo one fails alone at NVIDIA.\u201d I saw it play out live. Many years and bugs later, I admire that in our culture \u2014 we celebrate failures as opportunities to learn.\n\nIs there an accomplishment you\u2019re most proud of?\n\nI\u2019m very proud of our teamwork on NVIDIA Hopper architecture-based GPUs, which took critical project execution in the midst of the pandemic lockdown. The vast majority of the Hopper project cycle happened while people were adapting to a new way of working virtually, managing the requirements of home and work simultaneously. Despite it being a very challenging time, folks stepped up and kept going all the way. The amount of coordination needed to get the first version of this complex chip to production during the pandemic was immense.\nWhat is more satisfying is that the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU is used to accelerate drug discovery, so hopefully, we can avoid such pandemics in the future. It\u2019s an electronic engineer\u2019s contribution to the world of medicine.\n\n\nWhat are you most excited about in your field of work?\n\nIn the last decade, we\u2019ve seen rapid growth in the hardware industry with the advent of mobile and the speed of the internet. NVIDIA evolved from being a hardware company to a computing platform company during this time.\nAs the company keeps defining standards, we keep raising the bar and identifying new problems that we want to solve efficiently.\nI\u2019m excited about the opportunity to refine and redefine hardware to align with computing platforms. This includes tackling different types of problems that can benefit from the potential of hardware.\n\nWhat do you have going on outside NVIDIA?\n\n\nI dive into the world of books. Some of my favorite authors are Ayn Rand, Paulo Coelho and Anton Chekhov. But I enjoy Roald Dahl and Julia Donaldson with the same enthusiasm.\nI like playing board games with my daughter.\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They also discussed their latest projects and offered insights into future directions for the field of generative AI.\nWhile they started as Google researchers, the collaborators are now spread across the industry, most as founders of their own AI companies.\n\u201cWe have a whole industry that is grateful for the work that you guys did,\u201d Huang said.\nFrom L to R: Lukasz Kaiser, Noam Shazeer, Aidan Gomez, Jensen Huang, Llion Jones, Jakob Uszkoreit, Ashish Vaswani and Illia Polosukhin.\nOrigins of the Transformer Model\nThe research team initially sought to overcome the limitations of recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, which were then the state of the art for processing language data.\nNoam Shazeer, cofounder and CEO of Character.AI, compared RNNs to the steam engine and transformers to the improved efficiency of internal combustion.\n\u201cWe could have done the industrial revolution on the steam engine, but it would just have been a pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThings went way, way better with internal combustion.\u201d\n\u201cNow we\u2019re just waiting for the fusion,\u201d quipped Illia Polosukhin, cofounder of blockchain company NEAR Protocol.\nThe paper\u2019s title came from a realization that attention mechanisms \u2014 an element of neural networks that enable them to determine the relationship between different parts of input data \u2014 were the most critical component of their model\u2019s performance.\n\u201cWe had very recently started throwing bits of the model away, just to see how much worse it would get. And to our surprise it started getting better,\u201d said Llion Jones, cofounder and chief technology officer at Sakana AI.\nHaving a name as general as \u201ctransformers\u201d spoke to the team\u2019s ambitions to build AI models that could process and transform every data type \u2014 including text, images, audio, tensors and biological data.\n\u201cThat North Star, it was there on day zero, and so it\u2019s been really exciting and gratifying to watch that come to fruition,\u201d said Aidan Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere. \u201cWe\u2019re actually seeing it happen now.\u201d\nPacked house at the San Jose Convention Center.\nEnvisioning the Road Ahead\u00a0\nAdaptive computation, where a model adjusts how much computing power is used based on the complexity of a given problem, is a key factor the researchers see improving in future AI models.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about spending the right amount of effort and ultimately energy on a given problem,\u201d said Jakob Uszkoreit, cofounder and CEO of biological software company Inceptive. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to spend too much on a problem that\u2019s easy or too little on a problem that\u2019s hard.\u201d\nA math problem like two plus two, for example, shouldn\u2019t be run through a trillion-parameter transformer model \u2014 it should run on a basic calculator, the group agreed.\nThey\u2019re also looking forward to the next generation of AI models.\n\u201cI think the world needs something better than the transformer,\u201d said Gomez. \u201cI think all of us here hope it gets succeeded by something that will carry us to a new plateau of performance.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss these next 10 years,\u201d Huang said. \u201cUnbelievable new capabilities will be invented.\u201d\nThe conversation concluded with Huang presenting each researcher with a framed cover plate of the NVIDIA DGX-1 AI supercomputer, signed with the message, \u201cYou transformed the world.\u201d\nJensen presents lead author Ashish Vaswani with a signed DGX-1 cover.\nThere\u2019s still time to catch the session replay by registering for a virtual GTC pass \u2014 it\u2019s free.\nTo discover the latest in generative AI, watch Huang\u2019s GTC keynote address:\n\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AI | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | GTC 2024 | Machine Learning \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Local inference gives consumers reduced latency, eliminates their dependency on the network and enables more control over their data.\nNVIDIA GeForce and NVIDIA RTX GPUs feature Tensor Cores, dedicated AI hardware accelerators that provide the horsepower to run generative AI locally.\nStable Video Diffusion is now optimized for the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit, which unlocks the highest-performance generative AI on the more than 100 million Windows PCs and workstations powered by RTX GPUs.\nNow, the TensorRT extension for the popular Stable Diffusion WebUI by Automatic1111 is adding support for ControlNets, tools that give users more control to refine generative outputs by adding other images as guidance.\n\nTensorRT acceleration can be put to the test in the new UL Procyon AI Image Generation benchmark, which internal tests have shown accurately replicates real-world performance. It delivered speedups of 50% on a GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER GPU compared with the fastest non-TensorRT implementation.\nMore Efficient and Precise AI\nTensorRT enables developers to access the hardware that provides fully optimized AI experiences. AI performance typically doubles compared with running the application on other frameworks.\nIt also accelerates the most popular generative AI models, like Stable Diffusion and SDXL. Stable Video Diffusion, Stability AI\u2019s image-to-video generative AI model, experiences a 40% speedup with TensorRT.\nThe optimized Stable Video Diffusion 1.1 Image-to-Video model can be downloaded on Hugging Face.\nPlus, the TensorRT extension for Stable Diffusion WebUI boosts performance by up to 2x \u2014 significantly streamlining Stable Diffusion workflows.\nWith the extension\u2019s latest update, TensorRT optimizations extend to ControlNets \u2014 a set of AI models that help guide a diffusion model\u2019s output by adding extra conditions. With TensorRT, ControlNets are 40% faster.\nTensorRT optimizations extend to ControlNets for improved customization.\nUsers can guide aspects of the output to match an input image, which gives them more control over the final image. They can also use multiple ControlNets together for even greater control. A ControlNet can be a depth map, edge map, normal map or keypoint detection model, among others.\nDownload the TensorRT extension for Stable Diffusion Web UI on GitHub today.\nOther Popular Apps Accelerated by TensorRT\nBlackmagic Design adopted NVIDIA TensorRT acceleration in update 18.6 of DaVinci Resolve. Its AI tools, like Magic Mask, Speed Warp and Super Scale, run more than 50% faster and up to 2.3x faster on RTX GPUs compared with Macs.\nIn addition, with TensorRT integration, Topaz Labs saw an up to 60% performance increase in its Photo AI and Video AI apps \u2014 such as photo denoising, sharpening, photo super resolution, video slow motion, video super resolution, video stabilization and more \u2014 all running on RTX.\nCombining Tensor Cores with TensorRT software brings unmatched generative AI performance to local PCs and workstations. And by running locally, several advantages are unlocked:\n\nPerformance: Users experience lower latency, since latency becomes independent of network quality when the entire model runs locally. This can be important for real-time use cases such as gaming or video conferencing. NVIDIA RTX offers the fastest AI accelerators, scaling to more than 1,300 AI trillion operations per second, or TOPS.\nCost: Users don\u2019t have to pay for cloud services, cloud-hosted application programming interfaces or infrastructure costs for large language model inference.\nAlways on: Users can access LLM capabilities anywhere they go, without relying on high-bandwidth network connectivity.\nData privacy: Private and proprietary data can always stay on the user\u2019s device.\n\nOptimized for LLMs\nWhat TensorRT brings to deep learning, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM brings to the latest LLMs.\nTensorRT-LLM, an open-source library that accelerates and optimizes LLM inference, includes out-of-the-box support for popular community models, including Phi-2, Llama2, Gemma, Mistral and Code Llama. Anyone \u2014 from developers and creators to enterprise employees and casual users \u2014 can experiment with TensorRT-LLM-optimized models in the NVIDIA AI Foundation models. Plus, with the NVIDIA ChatRTX tech demo, users can see the performance of various models running locally on a Windows PC. ChatRTX is built on TensorRT-LLM for optimized performance on RTX GPUs.\nNVIDIA is collaborating with the open-source community to develop native TensorRT-LLM connectors to popular application frameworks, including LlamaIndex and LangChain.\nThese innovations make it easy for developers to use TensorRT-LLM with their applications and experience the best LLM performance with RTX.\nGet weekly updates directly in your inbox by subscribing to the AI Decoded newsletter.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: AI Decoded | Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The city has been working with NVIDIA and its partners to analyze traffic on the roads and intersections to help reduce congestion and enhance pedestrian safety.\n\u201cWe can now push traffic video into the NVIDIA DeepStream platform and can quantify in real time how many vehicles are entering and exiting intersections and visualize it for our engineers,\u201d said Alberque, a geoinformation systems and emerging technology manager for the city.\nSuch information can be fed to vendors responsible for keeping traffic lights optimized, so population expansion doesn\u2019t bring roadways to a crawl or increase the number of accidents.\nUrban growth has slowed commutes as metropolitan regions across the nation turn to AI for assistance in optimizing traffic flow.\n\u201cWe got great accuracy level using NVIDIA pre-trained AI computer vision models for traffic cameras right out of the box,\u201d said Alberque. \u201cAnd our engineers worked with an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, Quantiphi, to refine those models and got them up to an incredible 95% accuracy,\u201d said Alberque.\nThe Raleigh system uses hundreds of cameras to enhance its model training, and the city has its sights set on everything from road flooding, license plate tracking and parking utilization to bus stop wait times and sanitation management.\nFederal Initiatives Support Intersection Safety\nAdvances from the city of Raleigh and others looking to smooth the flow of traffic come as the U.S. Department of Transportation continues to support AI efforts.\nThe DOT recently announced winners of the first phase of its Intersection Safety Challenge, which aims to support innovation in intersection safety. Three of the DOT\u2019s winning entrants are harnessing NVIDIA Metropolis for smart intersections.\nIn this first stage, 15 participants who submitted design concept proposals for intersection safety systems out of 120 submissions were awarded $100,000 each and an invitation to participate further.\nThe next stage will focus on system assessment and virtual testing, with teams expected to develop, train and improve algorithms used for detection, localization and classification of vehicles and road users in a controlled test intersection.\nEnlisting NVIDIA AI for Smart Intersections\nDeloitte Consulting is building a foundation for smart intersections, enlisting the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework, developer tools and partner ecosystem.\nDerq USA is developing an intersection safety system that relies on NVIDIA Metropolis to help manage the deluge of sensor data for insights.\nMetropolis partner, Miovision, which has traffic light safety systems deployed across the U.S., uses the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform in its devices for processing video and TensorRT for inference.\n\u201cThere are so many people moving into our city and surrounding areas, and our number one and number two concerns for citizens are around traffic \u2014 this is providing data to move the needle,\u201d said Alberque, regarding Raleigh\u2019s Metropolis and DeepStream development.\n\u00a0\nRegister for GTC24 to discover how AI is transforming smart cities.

Currently offering models that convert text prompts to images or transform existing images, the company will this year add text-to-video and image-to-video AI.\n\u201cCreating generative AI models requires time and expertise,\u201d said Yair Adato, co-founder and CEO of Bria. \u201cWe do the heavy lifting so product teams can adopt our models to achieve a technical edge and go to market quickly, without investing as many resources.\u201d\nAdvertising agencies and retailers can use Bria\u2019s tools to quickly generate visuals for marketing campaigns. And creative studios can adopt the models to develop stock imagery or edit visuals. Dozens of enterprise clients have integrated the startup\u2019s pretrained models or use its application programming interfaces.\nBria develops its models with the NVIDIA NeMo framework, which is available on NGC, NVIDIA\u2019s hub for accelerated software. The company uses reference implementations from the NeMo Multimodal collection, trained on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, to enable high-throughput, low-latency image generation. It\u2019s also adopting NVIDIA NIM to run fast inference.\n\u201cWe were looking for a framework to train our models efficiently \u2014 one that would minimize compute cost while scaling AI training to more quickly reach model convergence,\u201d said Misha Feinstein, vice president of research and development at Bria. \u201cNeMo features optimization techniques that allow us to maximize the GPUs\u2019 performance during both training and inference.\u201d\nCreative Solutions to Creative Challenges\nBria, founded in 2020, offers flexible options for enterprises adopting visual generative AI. By adopting Bria\u2019s platform, its customers can gain a competitive edge by creating visual content at scale while retaining control of their data and technology. Developers can access its pretrained models through APIs or by directly licensing the source code and model weights for further fine-tuning.\n\u201cWe want to build a company where we respect privacy, content ownership, data ownership and copyright,\u201d said Adato. \u201cTo create a healthy, sustainable industry, it\u2019s important to incentivize individuals to keep creating and innovating.\u201d\nAdato likens Bria\u2019s attribution program to a music streaming service that pays artists each time one of their songs is played. It\u2019s required for all customers who use Bria\u2019s models \u2014 even if they further train and fine-tune the model on their own.\n\nUsing licensed datasets provides additional benefits: the Bria team doesn\u2019t need to spend time cleaning the data or sorting out inappropriate content and misinformation.\nA Growing Suite of NVIDIA-Accelerated Models\nBria offers two versions of its text-to-image model. One is latency-optimized to rapidly accomplish tasks like image background generation. The other offers higher image resolution. Additional foundation models enable super-resolution, object removal, object generation, inpainting and outpainting.\nThe company is working to continuously increase the resolution of its generated images, further reduce latency and develop domain-specific models for industries such as ecommerce and stock imagery. Inference is accelerated by the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software and the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit.\n\u201cWe\u2019re running on NVIDIA frameworks, hardware and software,\u201d said Feinstein. \u201cNVIDIA experts have helped us optimize these tools for our needs \u2014 we would probably run much slower without their help.\u201d\n\nTo keep up with the latest hardware and networking infrastructure, Bria uses cloud computing resources: NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs for AI training and a variety of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs for inference.\nBria is a member of NVIDIA Inception, a program that provides startups with technological support and AI platform guidance. Visit Bria in the Inception Pavilion at NVIDIA GTC, running March 18-21 in San Jose and online.\nTo train optimized text-to-image models, check out the NeMo Multimodal user guide and GitHub repository. NeMo Multimodal is also available as part of the NeMo container on NGC.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Art | Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | Inception | Media and Entertainment | NVIDIA NeMo | Retail | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  NVIDIA researchers have pumped a double shot of acceleration into their latest text-to-3D generative AI model, dubbed LATTE3D.\nLike a virtual 3D printer, LATTE3D turns text prompts into 3D representations of objects and animals within a second.\nCrafted in a popular format used for standard rendering applications, the generated shapes can be easily served up in virtual environments for developing video games, ad campaigns, design projects or virtual training grounds for robotics.\n\u201cA year ago, it took an hour for AI models to generate 3D visuals of this quality \u2014 and the current state of the art is now around 10 to 12 seconds,\u201d said Sanja Fidler, vice president of AI research at NVIDIA, whose Toronto-based AI lab team developed LATTE3D. \u201cWe can now produce results an order of magnitude faster, putting near-real-time text-to-3D generation within reach for creators across industries.\u201d\nThis advancement means that LATTE3D can produce 3D shapes near instantly when running inference on a single GPU, such as the NVIDIA RTX A6000, which was used for the NVIDIA Research demo.\n\nIdeate, Generate, Iterate: Shortening the Cycle\nInstead of starting a design from scratch or combing through a 3D asset library, a creator could use LATTE3D to generate detailed objects as quickly as ideas pop into their head.\nThe model generates a few different 3D shape options based on each text prompt, giving a creator options. Selected objects can be optimized for higher quality within a few minutes. Then, users can export the shape into graphics software applications or platforms such as NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based 3D workflows and applications.\n\nWhile the researchers trained LATTE3D on two specific datasets \u2014 animals and everyday objects \u2014 developers could use the same model architecture to train the AI on other data types.\nIf trained on a dataset of 3D plants, for example, a version of LATTE3D could help a landscape designer quickly fill out a garden rendering with trees, flowering bushes and succulents while brainstorming with a client. If trained on household objects, the model could generate items to fill in 3D simulations of homes, which developers could use to train personal assistant robots before they\u2019re tested and deployed in the real world.\nLATTE3D was trained using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. In addition to 3D shapes, the model was trained on diverse text prompts generated using ChatGPT to improve the model\u2019s ability to handle the various phrases a user might come up with to describe a particular 3D object \u2014 for example, understanding that prompts featuring various canine species should all generate doglike shapes.\n\nNVIDIA Research comprises hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\nResearchers shared work at NVIDIA GTC this week that advances the state of the art for training diffusion models.

The service will also incorporate new features to offer customers even further control of their generated images.\nDevelopers can test drive pretrained Edify models by Getty Images and Shutterstock as APIs through NVIDIA NIM, a collection of microservices for inference announced today at NVIDIA GTC. Developers can also train and deploy their own generative AI models using the Edify architecture through NVIDIA Picasso, an AI foundry built on NVIDIA DGX Cloud.\nNVIDIA and Adobe are collaborating to bring new 3D generative AI technologies built on Edify to millions of Firefly and Creative Cloud creators.\nLivestreaming platform Be.Live is using the NVIDIA Picasso foundry service to provide real-time generative AI that enables the automated creation of visuals and an interactive experience for audiences. Bria, a holistic platform tailored for businesses developing responsible visual generative AI, has adopted Picasso to run inference. And creative studio Cuebric is enhancing filmmaking and content creation by developing Picasso-powered generative AI applications to build immersive virtual environments.\nSpeedy 3D: Shutterstock 3D AI Generator Now in Early Access\nShutterstock\u2019s 3D AI Services, available in early access, will enable creators to generate virtual objects for set dressing and ideation. This capability can drastically reduce the time needed to prototype a scene, giving artists more time to focus on hero characters and objects.\n\nShutterstock 3D generator in action. Video courtesy of Shutterstock.\nUsing the tools, creative professionals will be able to rapidly create assets from text prompts or reference images and choose from a selection of popular 3D formats to export their files. The Edify 3D-based service will also come with built-in safeguards to filter generated content.\nThe commercially safe model was trained on Shutterstock\u2019s licensed data. Shutterstock has compensated hundreds of thousands of artists, with anticipated payments to millions more, for the role their content IP has played in training generative technology.\nAssets created using Shutterstock 3D AI generator, rendered and arranged as a flat-lay image. Image courtesy of Shutterstock.\nAt GTC, HP and Shutterstock are showcasing a collaboration to enhance custom 3D printing using Edify 3D, providing designers with limitless prototype options.\nShutterstock\u2019s 3D AI generator enables designers to rapidly iterate on concepts, creating digital assets that HP can convert to 3D printable models through automated workflows. HP 3D printers will then turn these models into physical prototypes to help inspire product designs.\nMattel is enabling 3D generative AI capabilities from Shutterstock that can accelerate the design ideation process. With AI tools, toy designers can visualize their ideas for new products with simple text descriptions. By lowering the technical barrier to creating high-fidelity concept design, designers can explore a broader pool of their ideas and iterate faster.\nShutterstock is also building Edify-based tools to light 3D scenes using 360 HDRi environments generated from text or image prompts.\nDassault Syst\u00e8mes, through its leading 3DEXCITE applications for 3D content creation, and CGI studio Katana are incorporating Shutterstock generative 360 HDRi APIs into their workflows based on NVIDIA Omniverse, a computing platform for developing Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based 3D workflows and applications.\nAccenture Song, the world\u2019s largest tech-powered creative group, is using the Omniverse platform to generate high-fidelity Defender vehicles from computer-aided design data for marketing purposes. Coupled with generative AI microservices powered by Edify, Accenture Song is enabling the creation of cinematic, interactive 3D environments via conversational prompts. The result is a fully immersive 3D scene that harmonizes realistic generated environments with a digital twin of the Defender vehicle.\nTake Control: Turn Creative Vision Into Reality With Custom Fine-Tuning From Getty Images\nGetty Images continues to expand the capabilities offered through its commercially safe generative AI service, which provides users indemnification for the content they generate.\nAt January\u2019s CES show, Getty Images released Edify-powered APIs for inpainting, to add, remove or replace objects in an image, and outpainting, to expand the creative canvas. Those features are now available on both Gettyimages.com and iStock.com.\nStarting in May, Getty Images will also offer services to custom fine-tune the Edify foundation model to a company\u2019s brand and visual style.\nThe services will feature a no-code, self-service method for companies to upload a proprietary dataset, review automatically generated tags, submit fine-tuning tasks and review the results before deploying to production.\nAs part of custom fine-tuning tools, Getty Images will release a collection of APIs that provide finer control over image output, one of the biggest challenges in generative AI.\nDevelopers will soon be able to access Sketch, Depth and Segmentation features \u2014 which allow users to provide a sketch to guide the AI\u2019s image generation; copy the composition of a reference image via depth map; and segment parts of an image to add, remove or retouch a character or object.\nGetty Images\u2019 API services are already being used by leading creatives and advertisers, including:\n\nDentsu Inc.: The Japan-based ad agency is using Getty Images\u2019 generative AI API service to power MAFA: Manga Anime For All, an app that can create manga and anime-style content for marketing use cases. Dentsu Creative is also using NVIDIA Picasso to fine-tune Getty Images\u2019 model for leading membership warehouse retailer Sam\u2019s Club.\nMcCann: The creative agency harnessed generative AI to help develop an innovative game for its client Reckitt\u2019s over-the-counter cold medicine Mucinex, in which customers can interact with the brand\u2019s mascot.\nRefik Anadol Studio: Known for using generative AI in its artwork and a member of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, the studio will be showcasing a rainforest-inspired art installation at GTC, created using Getty Images\u2019 AI model fine-tuned with Refik\u2019s rainforest catalog.\nWPP: The marketing and communications services company is partnering with The Coca-Cola Company to explore how fine-tuning Getty Images\u2019 model can help to build custom visuals that meet brand styles and guidelines.\n\nLarge Nature Model: Living Archive installation at GTC 2024 by Refik Anadol Studios\nLearn more about NVIDIA Picasso and try Edify-powered NIMs from Getty Images and Shutterstock at ai.nvidia.com.\nDiscover the latest in generative AI at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI developer conference, running in San Jose, Calif., and online through Thursday, March 21.\u00a0\nWatch the GTC keynote address by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang below:\n\nCollage at top shows assets created by Edify-powered Shutterstock 3D AI generator on left, courtesy of Shutterstock.

On March 18, 2024, when NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) for AI hardware and software developers returned to real life, in person, after five years, NVIDIA probably never expected to see even higher enthusiasm from the ecosystem of developers, researchers, and business strategists. Industry analysts including myself had to wait for about an hour to get into the SAP Center, and even being invited into the keynote with reserved seats, we weren\u2019t able to make our way into the area, as it was just too crowded and our seats were not available anymore.\nBut after watching the keynote at GTC 2024, I\u2019m very sure about one thing: This event, together with the extraordinary efforts made by all technology pioneers of enterprises, vendors, and academia worldwide, is unveiling a new chapter in the AI era, representing the beginning of a significant leap in the AI revolution. With the major announcements in this event spanning AI hardware infrastructure, a next-gen AI-native platform, and enabling AI software across representative application scenarios, NVIDIA paves the way to an enterprise AI-native foundation.\nAI Infrastructure: Building On Its Impressive Lead\nNVIDIA announced a few breakthroughs in AI infrastructure. Some representative new products include:\n\nBlackwell GPU series. The highly anticipated Blackwell GPU is the successor to NVIDIA\u2019s already highly coveted H100 and H200 GPUs, becoming the world\u2019s most powerful chip for AI workloads. NVIDIA also announced the combination of two Blackwell GPUs with NVIDIA\u2019s Grace CPU to create its GB200 Superchip. This setup is said to offer up to a 30x performance increase compared to the H100 GPU for large language model (LLM) inference workloads with up to 25x greater power efficiency.\nDGX GB200 System.\u00a0Each DGX GB200 system features 36 NVIDIA GB200 Superchips \u2014 which include 36 NVIDIA Grace CPUs and 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs \u2014 connected as one supercomputer via fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink. The GB200 Superchips deliver up to a 30x performance increase compared to the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU for LLM inference workloads.\nDGX SuperPOD.\u00a0The Grace Blackwell-powered DGX SuperPOD features eight or more DGX GB200 systems and can scale to tens of thousands of GB200 Superchips connected via NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand. For a massive shared memory space to power next-generation AI models, customers can deploy a configuration that connects the 576 Blackwell GPUs in eight DGX GB200 systems connected via NVLink.\n\nWhat it means: On one hand, these new products represent a significant leap forward in AI computing power and energy efficiency. Once deployed to production, they will not only significantly increase performance for both training and inferencing, enabling researchers and developers to tackle previously impossible problems, but they will also address customer concerns about power consumption. On the other hand, it also means that for existing customers of H100 and H200, the business advantages of their investments will become a limitation compared to its B-series. It also means that the tech vendors that wanted to make money by reselling AI computing power will have to figure out how to ensure ROI.\nEnterprise AI Software & Apps: The Next Frontier\nNVIDIA already built an integrated software kingdom around CUDA, and it\u2019s strategically building the capabilities of its enterprise AI portfolio, taking a cloud-native approach by leveraging Kubernetes, containers, and microservices with a distributed architecture. This year, with its latest achievements in AI software and applications, I\u2019m calling it \u201cgenAI-native\u201d \u2014 natively built for genAI development scenarios across training and inferencing and natively optimized for genAI hardware. Some representative ones are as follows:\n\nNVIDIA NIM to accelerate AI model inferencing through prebuilt containers. NVIDIA NIM is a set of optimized cloud-native microservices designed to simplify deployment of genAI models anywhere. It can be considered as an integrated inferencing platform across six layers: prebuilt container and Helm charts, industry-standard APIs, domain-specific code, optimized inference engines (e.g., Triton Inference Server\u2122 and TensorRT\u2122-LLM), and support for custom models, all based on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime. This abstraction will provide a streamlined path for developing AI-powered enterprise applications and deploying AI models in production.\nOfferings to advance development in transportation and healthcare. For transportation, NVIDIA announced that BYD, Hyper, and XPENG have adopted the NVIDIA DRIVE Thor\u2122 centralized car computer to power next-generation consumer and commercial fleets. And for healthcare, NVIDIA announced more than two dozen new microservices for advanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction and simulation.\nOfferings to facilitate innovation in humanoids, 6G, and quantum. For humanoids, NVIDIA announced Project GR00T, a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots, to further drive development in robotics and embodied AI. For telcos, it unveiled a 6G research cloud platform to advance AI for radio access network (RAN), consisting of NVIDIA Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin for 6G, NVIDIA Aerial CUDA-Accelerated RAN, and NVIDIA Sionna Neural Radio Framework. And for quantum computing, it launched a quantum simulation platform with a generative quantum eigensolver powered by an LLM to find the ground-state energy of a molecule more quickly and a QC Ware Promethium to tackle complex quantum chemistry problems such as molecular simulation.\nExpanded partnerships with all major hyperscalers, except Alibaba Cloud. In addition to the support of compute instances for the latest chipsets on major hyperscalers, NVIDIA is also expanding partnerships in various domains to accelerate digital transformation. For example, for AWS, Amazon SageMaker will provide integration with NVIDIA NIM to further optimize price performance of foundation models running on GPUs, with more collaboration on healthcare. And NVIDIA NIM is also coming to Azure AI, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud for AI deployments, with more initiatives on healthcare, industrial design, and sovereignty with AWS, Google, and Oracle respectively.\n\nWhat it means: NVIDIA has become a competitive software provider in the enterprise space, especially in areas that are relevant to genAI. Its advantage in AI hardware infrastructure has great potential to influence application architecture and the competitive landscape. However, enterprise decision-makers should also realize that its core strength is still in the hardware, lacking experiences and business solutioning capabilities in complex enterprise software business environments. And its availability of AI software (and also hardware underneath) varies across geographic regions, limiting its regional capabilities to serve local clients.\nLooking Ahead\nJensen and all other NVIDIA executives have been trying hard to convince their clients in the past years that NVIDIA is not a GPU company anymore. I would say that this mission is accomplished as of today. In other words, GPU is not what we think it is anymore, but two things are always the same: being obsessed with customer needs and being focused on the IT that drives high business performance. Enterprise decision-makers should keep an eye on NVIDIA\u2019s product roadmap, taking a pragmatic approach to turn bold vision into superior performance.\nOf course, this is only a fraction of the announcements at NVIDIA GTC 2024.

In other words, the combination of NVIDIA\u2019s latest Superchips running on AWS\u2019s cloud infrastructure will help customers across every industry unlock new generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities at an even faster pace.\u201cThe deep collaboration between our two organizations goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world\u2019s first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of NVIDIA GPU solutions for customers,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation Grace Blackwell processor marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing. When combined with AWS\u2019s powerful Elastic Fabric Adapter Networking, Amazon EC2 UltraClusters\u2019 hyper-scale clustering, and our unique Nitro system\u2019s advanced virtualization and security capabilities, we make it possible for customers to build and run multi-trillion parameter large language models (LLMs) faster, at massive scale, and more securely than anywhere else.\u201dAWS CEO Adam Selipsky (Left) and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang (Right) at AWS re:Invent 2023.One of the key areas where generative AI can make a massive difference is in healthcare and life sciences. AWS and NVIDIA have teamed up to expand computer-aided drug discovery with new AI models to help researchers model the efficacy of new chemical molecules, aid in protein structure prediction, and better understand how drug molecules interact with biological targets. NVIDIA\u2019s BioNeMo\u2122 FMs (foundation models) will soon be available on AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service that helps healthcare and life sciences organizations store, query, and analyze genomic, transcriptomic, and other \u201comics\u201d data.Whether in healthcare or any other industry, security is paramount. AWS AI infrastructure and services already have security features in place to give customers control over their data and ensure that it is not shared with third-party model providers. The latest combination and integration of NVIDIA and AWS technologies in the cloud extends that secure environment further. Enhanced security protects customer code and data during processing\u2014on both the customer side and AWS side.

They bring together a rich ecosystem of simulation tools, applications and sensors.\n\nThe application programming interfaces address the critical need for high-fidelity sensor simulations to safely explore the myriad real-world scenarios autonomous systems will encounter.\nIn addition, the Omniverse Cloud platform offers application developers access to a range of powerful Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), RTX and generative AI-enabled service-level cloud APIs to bring interoperability and physically based rendering to next-generation tools.\nSimulation Key to Unlocking New Levels of Safety\nAs demand increases for robots, AVs, and other AI systems, developers are seeking to accelerate their workflows. Sensor data powers these systems\u2019 perception capabilities, enabling them to comprehend their environment and make informed decisions in real time.\nTraditionally, developers have used real-world data for training, testing and validation.\nHowever, these methods are limited in covering rare scenarios or data that can\u2019t be captured in the real world. Sensor simulation provides a seamless way to effectively test countless \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios and diverse environmental conditions.\nWith Omniverse Cloud APIs, developers can enhance the workflows they\u2019re already using with high-fidelity sensor simulation to tackle the challenge of developing full-stack autonomy.\nThis not only streamlines the development process but also lowers the barriers to entry for companies of virtually all sizes developing autonomous machines.\nThe Ecosystem Advantage\nBy bringing together an expansive ecosystem of simulators, verification and validation (V&V) tools, content and sensor developers, the Omniverse Cloud APIs enable a universal environment for AI system development.\nDevelopers and software vendors such as CARLA, MathWorks, MITRE, Foretellix and Voxel51 underscore the broad appeal of these APIs in autonomous vehicles.\nCARLA is an open-source AV simulator used by more than 100,000 developers. With Omniverse Cloud APIs, CARLA users can enhance their existing workflows with high-fidelity sensor simulation.\nSimilarly, MITRE, a nonprofit that operates federally funded R&D centers and is dedicated to improving safety in technology, is building a Digital Proving Ground for the AV industry to validate self-driving solutions. The DPG will use the Omniverse APIs to enable core sensor simulation capabilities for their developers.\nMathWorks and Foretellix provide critical simulation tools for authoring, executing, monitoring, and debugging of testing scenarios. As the GTC demo showed, combining such simulation and test automation tools with the APIs forms a powerful test environment for AV development. On the showfloor, Foretellix is showing an in-depth look at this solution in Booth 630.\nAnd, by integrating the APIs with Voxel51\u2019s FiftyOne platform, developers can easily visualize and organize ground-truth data generated in simulation for streamlined training and testing.\nLeading industrial-sensor solution provider SICK AG is working on integrating these APIs in its sensor development process to reduce the number of physical prototypes, iterate quickly on design modifications and validate the eventual performance.

It also shared an eye-popping experience using NVIDIA Omniverse to interact with a digital twin of a Nissan Z sport coupe.\nIn a League With Giants\n\u201cEven for AI\u2019s titans, building on what Nvidia has created \u2014 the more ambitiously, the better \u2014 is often how progress happens,\u201d the article concluded.\nLast year, OpenAI led the list for ChatGPT, the large language model that started a groundswell in generative AI. In 2021, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech topped the ranking for rapidly developing a Covid vaccine.\nFast Company bases its ranking on four criteria: innovation, impact, timeliness and relevance. Launched in 2008, the annual list recognizes organizations that have introduced groundbreaking products, fostered positive social impact and reshaped industries.\nNVIDIA invented the GPU in 1999, redefining computer graphics and igniting the era of modern AI. NVIDIA is now driving the platform shift to accelerated computing and generative AI, transforming the world\u2019s largest industries.\nFueling an AI Revolution\nLast month, Huang was elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for contributions in \u201chigh-powered graphics processing units, fueling the artificial intelligence revolution.\u201d\nAcademy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions such as pioneering new fields of technology. Founded in 1964, the NAE provides a trusted source of engineering advice for creating a healthier, more secure and sustainable world.\n\u201cJensen Huang\u2019s induction into the National Academy of Engineering is a testament to his enduring contributions to our industry and world,\u201d said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft.\n\u201cHis visionary leadership has forever transformed computing, from the broad adoption of advanced 3D graphics to today\u2019s GPUs \u2014 and, more importantly, has driven foundational innovations across every sector, from gaming and productivity, to digital biology and healthcare. All of us at Microsoft congratulate Jensen on this distinction, and we are honored to partner with him and the entire NVIDIA team on defining this new era of AI,\u201d he added.\n\u201cJensen\u2019s election is incredibly well deserved,\u201d said John Hennessy, president emeritus of Stanford University and an NAE member since 1992.\n\u201cHis election recognizes both his transformative technical contributions, as well as his incredible leadership of NVIDIA for almost 30 years. I have seen many NAE nominations over the past 30 years, Jensen\u2019s was one of the best!\u201d\nMorris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and an NAE member since 2002, added his congratulations.\n\u201cJensen is one of the most visionary engineers and charismatic business leaders I have had the pleasure to work with in the last three decades,\u201d he said.\nHuang is also a recipient of the Semiconductor Industry Association\u2019s highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award, as well as honorary doctorate degrees from Taiwan\u2019s National Chiao Tung University, National Taiwan University and Oregon State University.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | Digital Twin | GPU | Hardware | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And with a GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, you can multiply performance by up to 3X thanks to DLSS 3.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s support for DLSS 2 Super Resolution, enabling all GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate frame rates, and support for NVIDIA Reflex, ensuring the most responsive gameplay possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiablo IV Ray Tracing Available Now\nBoot up Diablo IV, head to the settings menu and enable the new Ray Tracing option to enable 2 new ray-traced effects that can be individually adjusted and toggled.\nRay Traced Reflections enable bodies of water, pools of blood, and other suitably reflective game elements to mirror events occurring on screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view a 4K fullscreen comparison\nEnemies, attacks, visual effects, and more are all accurately reflected in the environment, making battles more exciting and the world more realistic and immersive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view a 4K fullscreen comparison\nRay Traced Shadows upgrade existing ones, and enable the simultaneous rendering of shadows from all light sources. In big co-op battles, with visual effects continuously illuminating the environment, ray-traced shadow detail is transformative. And each ray-traced shadow boasts accurate contact hardening and softening, allowing shadows to naturally soften as the distance from the shadow caster increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn moments of exploration, the overworld, cellars, dungeons and abandoned buildings look even more detailed, with ray-traced shadows naturally cast on and around objects, heightening immersion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The launch of Diablo IV was just the beginning for us. We are regularly iterating based on player feedback and exploring how we can enhance the visuals and dark atmosphere of the game. The addition of ray-traced effects is our next step in making the brutal world of Sanctuary feel more immersive than ever,\u201d said Michael Bukowski, Diablo IV Technical Director. \u201cEffects like lightning strikes are now reflected in pools of blood and water, dank cellars and dungeons are more foreboding with realistic soft shadows, and the open world and towns are more grounded with additional realistic shadows and reflections. We are very excited for our community to experience this new technology.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiply Performance By 3X With DLSS 3\nDiablo IV launched with day-one support for DLSS, enabling GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers to max out frame rates with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and other GeForce RTX users to accelerate performance with DLSS 2\u2019s critically acclaimed Super Resolution technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by new hardware capabilities of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture, DLSS 3 generates entirely new high quality frames, rather than just pixels.\nThrough a process detailed in full in our NVIDIA DLSS 3 article, DLSS 3 combines DLSS Super Resolution technology and DLSS Frame Generation to reconstruct 7 out of every 8 of the displayed pixels, multiplying performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS 3 accelerates frame rates in both GPU and CPU bound scenarios, ensuring your performance is always maxed out, and all DLSS 3 games are backwards compatible with DLSS 2 technology - developers simply integrate DLSS 3, and DLSS 2, also known as DLSS Super Resolution, is supported by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the release of the Diablo IV ray tracing update, DLSS 3 delivers a 3.1X average performance multiplier at 4K, with ray tracing and every other setting maxed out. On the world\u2019s most powerful gaming GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090, players can enjoy the definitive experience, with the very best graphics running at 144 frames per second. The recently-released GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER and GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER exceed 100 FPS, and the GeForce RTX 4070 and GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER handily pass 60 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, DLSS 3 boosts performance by an average of 2.3X, enabling all GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers to experience Diablo IV at max settings with ray tracing at over 60 FPS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, a 2.2X performance multiplier at both 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 enables fast max setting, ray-traced gameplay on many laptop configurations. At 1080p, every laptop tested ran at over 80 FPS, while the GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 laptops hit 120 FPS, with only a CPU bottleneck preventing even faster performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, GeForce RTX 4070 laptops can run at over 67 FPS with everything maxed, GeForce RTX 4080 laptops surpass 100 FPS, and the all-powerful GeForce RTX 4090 laptop achieved a blistering 116 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimize System Latency With NVIDIA Reflex\nNVIDIA Reflex is a game-changer, reducing system latency on GeForce graphics cards and laptops so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its debut in September 2020, NVIDIA Reflex is now reducing system latency in over 100 games, over 90% of GeForce gamers enable Reflex. 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters feature Reflex support, such as, Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare\u00ae III, Call of Duty\u00ae: Warzone\u2122, and Overwatch 2, along with critically acclaimed smash hit games such as Diablo IV. And in 2023 alone, GeForce gamers played over 10 billion hours of their favorite titles with increased responsiveness thanks to Reflex\u2019s innovative system latency reducing technology.\nUsing Reflex, system latency is reduced in Diablo IV, helping you vanquish the forces of evil, delivering responsiveness in intense battles, aiding your quest to stay alive in Hardcore mode, and providing you the ultimate experience against human foes in PvP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Settings For The Ray Tracing Update\nOne-click optimal settings in GeForce Experience and the NVIDIA app beta enable you to instantly configure game options for your system\u2019s hardware, giving you smooth, optimized gameplay.

And this means the route optimization engine allows industries to hop on board for all kinds of cost-saving efficiencies.\nKawasaki Heavy Industries and SyncTwin are among the companies that are riding cuOpt for logistics improvements.\nToday at GTC 2024, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced that cuOpt is moving into general availability.\n\u201cWith cuOpt, NVIDIA is reinventing logistics management and operations research. It is NVIDIA\u2019s pre-quantum computer, driving transformational operational efficiencies for deliveries, service calls, warehouses and factories, and supply chains,\u201d he said.\nThe NVIDIA cuOpt microservice, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, makes accelerated optimization for real-time dynamic rerouting, factory optimization and robotic simulations available to any organization.\nCompanies can embed cuOpt into the advanced 3D tools, applications and USD-based workflows they develop with NVIDIA Omniverse, a software platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on OpenUSD.\nImplemented together, cuOpt, Omniverse and NVIDIA Metropolis for Factories can help optimize and create safe environments in logistics-heavy facilities that rely on complex automation, precise material flow and human-robot interaction, such as automotive factories, semiconductor fabs and warehouses.\ncuOpt has been continuously tested against the best-known solutions on the most studied benchmarks for route optimization, with results up to 100x faster than CPU-based implementations. With 15 records from the Gehring & Homberger vehicle routing benchmark and eight from the Li & Lim pickup and delivery benchmark, cuOpt has demonstrated the world\u2019s best accuracy with the fastest times.\nAI promises to deliver logistics efficiencies spanning from transportation networks to manufacturing and much more.\nDelivering Cost-Savings for Inspections With cuOpt\nKawasaki Heavy Industries is a manufacturing company that\u2019s been building large machinery for more than a hundred years. The Japanese company partnered with Slalom and used cuOpt to create routing efficiencies for the development of its AI-driven Kawasaki Track Maintenance Platform.\nRailroad track maintenance is getting an AI makeover worldwide. Traditionally, track inspections and maintenance are time-consuming and difficult to manage to keep trains running on time. But track maintenance is critical for safety and transportation service. Railway companies are automating track inspections with AI and machine learning paired with digital cameras, lasers and gyrometric sensors.\nKawasaki is harnessing the edge computing of NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin to develop track inspections on its Track Maintenance Platform for running onboard trains. The platform enables customers to improve vision models with the data collected on tracks for advances in the inspection capability of the edge-based AI system.\nThe platform provides maintenance teams data on track conditions that allows them to prioritize repairs, creating increased safety and reliability of operations.\nAccording to Kawasaki, it\u2019s estimated that such an AI-driven system can save $218 million a year for seven companies from automating their track inspections.\nCreating Manufacturing Efficiencies With cuOpt and Omniverse\nA worldwide leader in automotive seating manufacturing has adopted SyncTwin\u2019s digital twin capability, which is driven by Omniverse and cuOpt, to improve its operations with AI.\nThe global automotive seating manufacturer has a vast network of loading docks for the delivery of raw materials, and forklifts for unloading and transporting them to storage and handling areas to ensure a steady supply to production lines. SyncTwin\u2019s connection to cuOpt delivers routing efficiencies that optimize all of these moving parts \u2014 from vehicles to robotic pallet jacks.\nAs the SyncTwin solution was developed on top of Omniverse and USD, manufacturers can ensure that their various factory planning tools can contribute to the creation of a rich digital twin environment. Plus, they eliminate tedious manual data collection and gain new insights from their previously disconnected data.\nAttend GTC to explore how cuOpt is achieving world-record accuracy and performance to solve complex problems.

It\u2019s available from leading cloud service providers, system builders and software vendors \u2014 and it\u2019s in use at customers such as Uber.\n\u201cOur adoption of NVIDIA AI Enterprise inference software is important for meeting the high performance our users expect,\u201d said Albert Greenberg, vice president of platform engineering at Uber. \u201cUber prides itself on being at the forefront of adopting and using the latest, most advanced AI innovations to deliver a customer service platform that sets the industry standard for effectiveness and excellence.\u201d\nMicroservices Speed App Development\nDevelopers are turning to microservices as an efficient way to build modern enterprise applications at a global scale. Working from a browser, they use cloud APIs, or application programming interfaces, to compose apps that can run on systems and serve users worldwide.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise 5.0 now includes a wide range of microservices \u2014 NVIDIA NIM for deploying AI models in production and the\u00a0 NVIDIA CUDA-X collection of microservices which includes NVIDIA cuOpt.\nNIM microservices optimize inference for dozens of popular AI models from NVIDIA and its partner ecosystem.\nPowered by NVIDIA inference software \u2014 including Triton Inference Server, TensorRT, and TensorRT-LLM \u2014 NIM slashes deployment times from weeks to minutes. It provides security and manageability based on industry standards as well as compatibility with enterprise-grade management tools.\nNVIDIA cuOpt is a GPU-accelerated AI microservice that\u2019s set world records for route optimization and can empower dynamic decision-making that reduces cost, time and carbon footprint. It\u2019s one of the CUDA-X microservices that help industries put AI into production.\nMore capabilities are in the works. For example, NVIDIA RAG LLM operator \u2014 now in early access and described in more detail here \u2014 will move co-pilots and other generative AI applications that use retrieval-augmented generation from pilot to production without rewriting any code.\nNVIDIA microservices are being adopted by leading application and cybersecurity platform providers including CrowdStrike, SAP and ServiceNow.\nMore Tools and Features\nThree other updates in version 5.0 are worth noting.\nThe platform now packs NVIDIA AI Workbench, a developer toolkit for quickly downloading, customizing, and running generative AI projects. The software is now generally available and supported with an NVIDIA AI Enterprise license.\nVersion 5.0 also now supports Red Hat OpenStack Platform, the environment most Fortune 500 companies use for creating private and public cloud services. Maintained by Red Hat, it provides developers a familiar option for building virtual computing environments. IBM Consulting will help customers deploy these new capabilities.\nIn addition, version 5.0 expands support to cover a wide range of the latest NVIDIA GPUs, networking hardware and virtualization software.\nAvailable to Run Anywhere\nThe enhanced NVIDIA AI platform is easier to access than ever.\nNIM and CUDA-X microservices and all the 5.0 features will be available soon on the AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud marketplaces.\nFor those who prefer to run code in their own data centers, VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA will support the software, so it can be deployed in the virtualized data centers of Broadcom\u2019s customers.\nCompanies have the option of running NVIDIA AI Enterprise on Red Hat OpenShift, allowing them to deploy on bare-metal or virtualized environments. It\u2019s also supported on Canonical\u2019s Charmed Kubernetes as well as Ubuntu.\nIn addition, the AI platform will be part of the software available on HPE ProLiant servers from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). HPE\u2019s enterprise computing solution for generative AI handles inference and model fine-tuning using NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\nIn addition, NVIDIA Inception member Anyscale, Dataiku and DataRobot \u2014 three leading providers of the software for managing machine learning operations\u00a0\u2014 will support NIM on their platforms. They join an NVIDIA ecosystem of hundreds of MLOps partners, including Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, Dataloop AI, Domino Data Lab and Weights & Biases.\nHowever they access it, NVIDIA AI Enterprise 5.0 users can benefit from software that\u2019s secure, production-ready and optimized for performance. It can be flexibly deployed for applications in the data center, the cloud, on workstations or at the network\u2019s edge.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise is available through leading system providers, including Cisco, Dell Technologies, HP, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro.\nHear Success Stories at GTC\nUsers will share their experiences with the software at NVIDIA GTC, a global AI conference, running March 18-21 at the San Jose Convention Center.\nFor example, ServiceNow chief digital information officer Chris Bedi will speak on a panel about harnessing generative AI\u2019s potential. In a separate talk, ServiceNow vice president of AI Products Jeremy Barnes will share on using NVIDIA AI Enterprise to achieve maximum developer productivity.\nExecutives from BlackRock, Medtronic, SAP and Uber will discuss their work in finance, healthcare, enterprise software, and business operations using the NVIDIA AI platform.\nIn addition, executives from ControlExpert, a global application provider for\u00a0 car insurance companies based in Germany, will share how they developed an AI-powered claims management solution using NVIDIA AI Enterprise software.\nThey\u2019re among a growing set of companies that benefit from NVIDIA\u2019s work evaluating hundreds of internal and external generative AI projects \u2014 all integrated into a single package that\u2019s been tested for stability and security.\nAnd get the full picture from NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang in his GTC keynote.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | CUDA | Customer Stories | GTC 2024 | Inception | Inference | Machine Learning | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA AI Workbench | NVIDIA NIM | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Teamcenter X is Siemens\u2019 industry-leading cloud-based product lifecycle management (PLM) software.\nNVIDIA Omniverse is a platform of APIs and services based on Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) that enables developers to build generative AI-powered tools, applications and services for industrial digital twins and automation.\nEnterprises of all sizes depend on Teamcenter software, part of the Siemens Xcelerator platform, to develop and deliver products at scale. By connecting NVIDIA Omniverse with Teamcenter X, Siemens will be able to provide engineering teams with the ability to make their physics-based digital twins more immersive and photorealistic, helping eliminate workflow waste and reduce errors.\nThrough the use of Omniverse APIs, workflows such as applying materials, lighting environments and other supporting scenery assets in physically based renderings will be dramatically accelerated using generative AI.\nAI integrations will also allow engineering data to be contextualized as it would appear in the real world, allowing other stakeholders \u2014 from sales and marketing teams to decision-makers and customers \u2014 to benefit from deeper insight and understanding of real-world product appearance.\nUnifying and Visualizing Complex Industrial Datasets\nTraditionally, companies have relied heavily on physical prototypes and costly modifications to complete large-scale industrial projects and build complex, connected products. That approach is expensive and error-prone, limits innovation and slows time to market.\nBy connecting Omniverse Cloud APIs to the Xcelerator platform, Siemens will enable its customers to enhance their digital twins with physically based rendering, helping supercharge industrial-scale design and manufacturing projects. With the ability to connect generative AI APIs or agents, users can effortlessly generate 3D objects or high-dynamic range image backgrounds to view their assets in context.\nThis means that companies like HD Hyundai, a leader in sustainable ship manufacturing, can unify and visualize complex engineering projects directly within Teamcenter X. At NVIDIA GTC, Siemens and NVIDIA demonstrated how HD Hyundai could use the software to visualize digital twins of liquified natural gas carriers, which can comprise over 7 million discrete parts, helping validate their product before moving to production.\nInteroperable, photoreal and physics-based digital twins like these accelerate engineering collaboration and allow customers to minimize workflow waste, save time and costs, and reduce risk of manufacturing defects.\n\nCombining Digital and\u00a0Physical\u00a0Worlds With Omniverse APIs\nOmniverse Cloud APIs enable data interoperability and physically based rendering for industrial-scale design and manufacturing projects in Teamcenter X. This starts with a real-time, embedded, photoreal viewport powered by the USD Render and USD Write APIs, which engineers can use to interactively navigate, edit and iterate on a shared model of their live data.\nThe USD Query API lets Teamcenter X users navigate and interact with physically accurate scenes, while the USD Notify API automatically provides real-time design and scene updates. To facilitate cloud-based collaboration and data exchange, Teamcenter X will leverage the Omniverse Channel API to establish a secure connection between multiple users across devices.\nIn the future, Siemens plans to bring NVIDIA accelerated computing, generative AI and Omniverse to more of its Siemens Xcelerator portfolio.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Omniverse, Siemens Xcelerator and the partnership.\nGet started with NVIDIA Omniverse, access OpenUSD resources, and learn how Omniverse Enterprise can connect your team. Stay up to date on Instagram, Medium and Twitter.

But it\u2019s also posing significant challenges for their IT teams, as slowdowns from long and complex infrastructure deployment cycles prevent them from quickly spinning up AI workloads using their own data.\nTo help overcome these barriers, NVIDIA has introduced a storage partner validation program for NVIDIA OVX computing systems. The high-performance storage systems leading the way in completing the NVIDIA OVX storage validation are DDN, Dell PowerScale, NetApp, Pure Storage and WEKA.\nNVIDIA OVX servers combine high-performance, GPU-accelerated compute with high-speed storage access and low-latency networking to address a range of complex AI and graphics-intensive workloads. Chatbots, summarization and search tools, for example, require large amounts of data, and high-performance storage is critical to maximize system throughput.\nTo help enterprises pair the right storage with NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers, the new program provides a standardized process for partners to validate their storage appliances. They can use the same framework and testing that\u2019s needed to validate storage for the NVIDIA DGX BasePOD reference architecture.\nTo achieve validation, partners must complete a suite of NVIDIA tests measuring storage performance and input/out scaling across multiple parameters that represent the demanding requirements of various enterprise AI workloads. This includes combinations of different I/O sizes, varying numbers of threads, buffered I/O vs. direct I/O, random reads, re-reads and more.\nEach test is run multiple times to verify the results and gather the required data, which is then audited by NVIDIA engineering teams to determine whether the storage system has passed.\nThe program offers prescriptive guidance to ensure optimal storage performance and scalability for enterprise AI workloads with NVIDIA OVX systems. But the overall design remains flexible, so customers can tailor their system and storage choices to fit their existing data center environments and bring accelerated computing to wherever their data resides.\nGenerative AI use cases have fundamentally different requirements than traditional enterprise applications, so IT teams must carefully consider their compute, networking, storage and software choices to ensure high performance and scalability.\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems are tested and validated to provide enterprise-grade performance, manageability, security and scalability for AI workloads. Their flexible reference architectures help deliver faster, more efficient and more cost-effective deployments than independently building from the ground up.\nPowered by NVIDIA L40S GPUs, OVX servers include NVIDIA AI Enterprise software with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand or NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking, as well as NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs. They\u2019re optimized for generative AI workloads, including training for smaller LLMs (for example, Llama 2 7B or 70B), fine-tuning existing models and inference with high throughput and low latency.\nNVIDIA-Certified OVX servers are now available and shipping from global system vendors, including GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro. Comprehensive, enterprise-grade support for these servers is provided by each system builder, in collaboration with NVIDIA.\nAvailability\u00a0\nValidated storage solutions for NVIDIA-Certified OVX servers are now available, and reference architectures will be published over the coming weeks by each of the storage and system vendors.

As a microservice, it lets users for the first time build and test in the cloud new quantum algorithms and applications \u2014 including powerful simulators and tools for hybrid quantum-classical programming.\n\u201cQuantum computing presents the next revolutionary frontier of computing and it\u2019s going to require the world\u2019s most brilliant minds to bring this future one step closer,\u201d said Tim Costa, director of HPC and quantum computing at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA Quantum Cloud breaks down the barriers to explore this transformative technology and lets every scientist in the world harness the power of quantum computing and bring their ideas closer to reality.\u201d\nQuantum Cloud features powerful capabilities and third-party software integrations to accelerate scientific exploration, including:\n\nThe Generative Quantum Eigensolver, developed in a collaboration with the University of Toronto, leverages large language models (LLMs) to enable a quantum computer to find the ground-state energy of a molecule more quickly.\nClassiq\u2019s integration with CUDA-Q\u00a0allows quantum researchers to generate large, sophisticated quantum programs, as well as to deeply analyze and execute quantum circuits.\nQC Ware Promethium\u00a0tackles complex quantum chemistry problems such as molecular simulation.\n\nAdoption by Quantum Ecosystem\r\nNVIDIA has more than 160 partners in its quantum computing ecosystem. Leading cloud service providers are integrating Quantum Cloud into their offerings, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, as are many leading quantum companies, such as IQM Quantum Computers, OQC, ORCA Computing, qBraid and Quantinuum.\nNVIDIA Quantum Cloud Availability\r\nQuantum computing innovators can get a head start on accelerating their quantum computing development with NVIDIA Quantum Cloud by signing up for early access.\nTo learn more about NVIDIA Quantum Cloud, watch the\u00a0GTC keynote\u00a0from Jensen Huang, and\u00a0register for GTC\u00a0for free to attend sessions from NVIDIA and industry leaders through March 21.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993,\u00a0NVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.
