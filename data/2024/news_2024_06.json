We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 67% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).  Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NVIDIA.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Ownership Breakdown June 29th 2024   What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth June 29th 2024   Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.   Story Continues While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$119b. we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

[+] smartphone screen against a computer screen displaying a stock charts image, as stock value of the company has risen dramatically due to its sales of chps needed for AI development. (Photo Illustration by Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nFollowing a 10% rally over the last five trading days, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the world\u2019s most valuable company, led by surging AI-driven graphics processing unit demand and the company\u2019s recent stock split. With a $3.3 trillion valuation, Nvidia is now worth more than tech behemoths Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\n\nNvidia has a lot going for it. Companies are looking to shift their sizable installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. Nvidia\u2019s accelerated computing chips remain meaningfully ahead of rivals such as AMD and Alphabet\u2019s Tensor processing units in terms of performance at the moment. Over Q1 FY\u201925, the company saw sales more than triple year-over-year to $26 billion, while net profits were up over 7x to $14.9 billion. Nvidia\u2019s outlook is also strong, with the company guiding for about $28 billion in revenue for Q2 FY\u201925, ahead of Street estimates and about 2x compared to the year-ago quarter. Nvidia says that demand for its newer H200 and the Blackwell architecture chips is well ahead of availability, with supply expected to lag demand well into the next year. Moreover, while the initial AI models unveiled by the likes of OpenAI were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power. This could support demand for GPUs in the near term.\n\nLooking at a slightly longer period, NVDA stock has seen extremely strong gains of 940% from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $135 now, vs. an increase of about 45% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in NVDA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that NVDA underperformed the S&P in 2022. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\n\nComing back to Nvidia, what\u2019s the outlook like for the stock? At the current market price of about $136 per share, Nvidia stock trades at about 50x forward earnings and the market might be pricing in that Nvidia will essentially own the AI chip market. However, this may not be the case. While Nvidia remains in pole position for AI chips, other chipmakers such as AMD are investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD unveiled the MI300X chip which is targeted specifically at large language model training and inference for generative AI workloads. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia\u2019s chips in several parameters. AMD\u2019s Data Center segment - which includes sales of its server chips and the MI300 series AI chips - saw sales rise by about 80% year-over-year to $2.3 billion in the most recent quarter. Separately, big tech players like Google are doubling down on AI and machine learning-related silicon. For example, Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units are specialized integrated circuits focused on machine learning. Although Nvidia\u2019s chips are superior in terms of overall performance at present, with the company also using proprietary software and programming languages to better lock in customers, competition will make Nvidia\u2019s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable. Net margins stood at a whopping 57% during the last quarter.\n\nBesides higher competition, there are some other concerns as well. The big surge in GPU demand we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After training models, utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nNvidia\u2019s revenue concentration is also an issue. Bloomberg estimates that Microsoft accounts for about 15% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, followed by Facebook parent Meta Platforms at 13%, Amazon at 6%, and Alphabet at about 6% of revenue. Many of these big customers are working on their own AI chips.\n\nGovernments are looking to regulate the sector, considering that AI is viewed as a transformational technology. The Biden administration has placed export restrictions on the export of advanced chips such as the A100 and H100 GPUs to China. Although Nvidia has tweaked the design, offering altered chips that play within the rules of the Chinese market, this does underscore the risks for the company.\n\n\nAlthough the company has growth on its side, with sales likely to roughly double this year per consensus estimates, this could prove a risk for investors if growth falters for any reason, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment. We value Nvidia stock at $89 per share, about 34% below the current market price.

The chip designer took an early lead in the AI hardware race, leading to incredible business results and skyrocketing stock prices.\nThe stock traded at a split-adjusted $14 per share when OpenAI released the ChatGPT generative AI engine, powered by thousands of Nvidia AI accelerator chips. Today, Nvidia's share price has soared to $131. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, it's one of the three most valuable companies in the stock market.\nDid you miss the boat on Nvidia's AI-based opportunity, or can the stock continue to rise from this lofty plateau? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's upsides\nNvidia's financial success is indisputable. Revenues more than tripled year-over-year in the last two earnings reports. Free cash flows are consistently growing by about 500% in the same time frame. Microsoft (MSFT -1.47%) and Apple (AAPL -0.88%) are still more profitable than Nvidia, but the chip expert is catching up.\nMany market observers like to point out that the generative AI revolution is only getting started. ChatGPT is less than two years old. Only a couple of tech giants have come up with comparably powerful large language models (LLMs) so far, though many are working on their own long-term generative AI plans. Until further notice, Nvidia's accelerator chips are the gold standard against which other solutions must be measured. If you're building a strong AI system, Nvidia's solutions are the default and the industry standard. Others must develop and then prove some sort of unique advantage before winning AI contracts against Nvidia's killer products.\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine Nvidia maintaining its lead as the generative AI market grows. It's not hard to see the stock soaring even higher over the next few years.\nNvidia's potential downsides\nOn the other hand, the good financial news and a whole lot of forward-looking expectations are already priced into Nvidia's stock. Shares are changing hands at glossy valuation ratios such as 82 times free cash flow and 40 times sales -- levels usually reserved for small-cap start-ups with more sizzle than substance.\nAt the same time, Nvidia doesn't stand unchallenged in the AI accelerator market. Arch rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.70%) has its Instinct line of cost-effective AI chips. The Intel (INTC 1.75%) Gaudi series boasts impressive performance per watt of electric power. And that's just the top of a large heap. There's more than one way to design an AI-crunching system, and rival solutions may offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Who's to say that Nvidia will hang on to its market-defining lead in the long run?\nSeparately, the issues of high valuation and strong competition should be enough to give most investors pause before slamming that \"buy\" button on Nvidia stock. Together, it's a high-wire act with a long way down. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection and any misstep -- such as a major AI contract lost to Intel or AMD -- will probably result in a quick and painful price drop.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia?\nI'm not saying you should sell every Nvidia share right now and never look back. The company could very well stave off the army of rivals and continue to innovate on a hard-to-match level. Indeed, a bit of Nvidia exposure could serve your portfolio well over the years.\nMeanwhile, I highly recommend taking some profits off the table by selling a portion of your long-term Nvidia holdings. The gains are more than substantial and I'm sure you can find more stable and secure ways to invest that money in the AI market.\nSo on the scale of buy, sell, or hold, I see Nvidia as a stock to hold for the long run. I'd rather sell a few shares than buy more at these nosebleed-inducing share prices. Your mileage may vary, depending on your appetite for market risk and AI-driven excitement. Feel free to do your own research and reach different conclusions. Just don't say I didn't warn you if or when Nvidia's big price correction comes.\n\n\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in Intel and Nvidia.

With Microsoft still ahead of it, when will Nvidia become the most valuable company in the world?\n\n\nJune 10, 2024\u2022\n\nBrad Simmerman\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Save article\n            \n\n                Article Saved\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n    \n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Print\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia (NVDA) notched three simultaneous wins in its belt: its share price broke above 1,200 for the first time ever, the company achieved a $3 trillion market capitalization, and it usurped Apple (AAPL) as the second-largest company in the world, trailing only Microsoft (MSFT).In the days since, Nvidia has surrendered all three of those achievements, at least for the time being, with shares falling back below the 1,200 level after trading as high as 1,255 Thursday morning.Given the pace of recent gains for what is the most important, if not the biggest, company these days, it\u2019s fair to wonder when Nvidia may finally be the most valuable company in the world and leave Microsoft, and all the others, in the dust.[text_ad]For context, Nvidia\u2019s rise from a $1 trillion market cap to a $2 trillion market cap took only 180 days, the fastest on record.That was on March 1. The rise from $2 trillion to $3 trillion took only 97 days.That is a staggering pace.Even with the recent dip, Nvidia\u2019s path to becoming the most valuable company in the world seems all but inevitable.When Might NVDA Overtake MSFT?At the time of writing, Nvidia is trading with a market cap of $2.935 trillion, compared to Microsoft\u2019s market cap of $3.156 trillion, a gap of only $221 billion, or 7.5%.Assuming no change in the value of MSFT shares, NVDA would only need to achieve a pre-split price of around 1,290, which would translate to a post-split price of 129 a share (shares will reflect a 10-for-1 forward split on Monday, June 10, 2024).Assuming that any market conditions that support NVDA continuing to run towards all-time highs would also favor MSFT, it\u2019s fair to suppose that NVDA will actually need to outpace MSFT a bit further.So, let\u2019s bake that into our assumptions.Thus far in 2024, MSFT has returned 14.4%, roughly in line with the S&P 500\u2019s 12.8% YTD gain.NVDA, on the other hand, has returned a staggering 147.6%, more than 10 times MSFT\u2019s returns.If we extrapolate that forward, at the time NVDA would have surpassed MSFT\u2019s $3.156 trillion market cap, MSFT would have gained a bit of ground, to about $3.18 trillion (that assumes MSFT\u2019s gain is 10% of NVDA\u2019s, in line with the YTD performance).It wouldn\u2019t take much more of a push beyond that. A return of ~8.5% would offset any corresponding bump in MSFT stock.But, given the variance in daily returns (and for symbolic purposes), we can fairly safely assume that if NVDA eclipses a pre-split price of 1,300 per share (130 per share after the split) it will not only achieve that round-number milestone, but it will also overtake Microsoft as the most valuable company in the world.Will it happen? As we\u2019re fond of saying at Cabot, I don\u2019t know, my crystal ball is in the shop. But I wouldn\u2019t bet against it.At the same time, in a conversation with my colleague and co-host Chris Preston on a recent episode of our Cabot Street Check podcast, we discussed Nvidia\u2019s valuation and are both in the \u201chold\u201d camp.Nvidia\u2019s performance over the last few years has been unprecedented. We\u2019re talking about a trillion-dollar company that doubled its market cap in six months and added another trillion in roughly the next three.Betting against Nvidia these days seems to be nothing short of a fool\u2019s errand, but the returns would have to stay unprecedented going forward to justify opening a new position given the run it\u2019s had.So if you\u2019re holding NVDA shares, enjoy the ride. If not, take solace in the fact that if you own ETFs or mutual funds in your 401(k), you already have some exposure to NVDA, probably just not as much as you\u2019d want in hindsight.[author_ad]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Email\n    \n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Print\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrad Simmerman\n\n\n                    Brad Simmerman is Senior Analyst and Editor of Cabot Wealth Daily, the award-winning free daily advisory.\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet My Free Report\n\n\nAs Seen On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Your Free ReportsYou have access to our expertly curated collection of free investing reports, including 5 Best Stocks to Buy this Month, How to Find Undervalued Stocks, How Options Work, and more.Get My Reports\n\n\n\n\nBrowse Topics\n\n\n\nCannabis Stocks\n\n\nDividend Stocks\n\n\nGrowth Stocks\n\n\nInternational Stocks\n\n\nOptions Trading\n\n\nPersonal Finance\n\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nTech Stocks\n\n\nValue Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Videos\n\n\nStill Playing Defense, but Positive Signs Emerging | Cabot Weekly Review\n\nMarch 14, 2025\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Mike Cintolo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree Reports\n\n\n\n5 Best Stocks to Buy in March\n\n\nThe 7 Best Places in the World to Retire on a Budget\n\n\nEssential Guide to High-Probability Trading\n\n\nCabot\u2019s Best Dividend Stocks\n\n\nHow Options Work\u2014and How to Hedge Portfolios with Options\n\n\nHow to Find Undervalued Stocks\n\n\nHow to Invest in Stocks\n\n\nTechnical Analysis of Stocks\n\n\nHow to Invest in Cannabis Stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabot offers the rare combination of expert insight and confident contrarian/independent thinking to individual investors.

I am a member of Cabot Prime Pro. Best investment I ever made.\n\nB.A., Novi, Michigan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is your qualities of truthfulness, honesty and candor that have drawn me to the Cabot family of letters and to date, I am very pleased. The yo-yo effect of the market has not phased me. Reading your letters are like a prayer to me...they calm me.\n\nA. Khorsandian, Daytona Beach, Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacob gives me peace and tranquility. If I have to define him, he is a little more in the conservative side. Patience is his key and that gives me plenty of time to stay relax and trade as he advises. I have an 85% record with him in all the trades. To be honest, I put my threshold for profits lower but as he says that is my technique and I\u2019m quite happy with it. I will recommend Jacob any time.\n\nV. Maines, Mission Viejo, California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d recommend Cabot Top Ten to a friend with confidence that the Cabot people are like family and you can trust their every intention!

Archer, Springboro, Ohio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler, I want you to know that since I subscribed in October 2016 that I am very pleased with the investment advice. You have exceeded my expectations. I find your commentary on the monthly stock picks comprehensive and balanced. I also appreciate your weekly updates as you share your thoughts and sometimes address any concerns which I may have. It is also most useful to get your advice on when to sell a stock.\n\nKen K, West Indies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI manage four Trusts and have relied on Cabot newsletters for advice for years. The investments I\u2019ve made, thanks to them, have done extremely well. Chris Preston has been particularly helpful, responding immediately to my occasional emails. I cannot recommend the Cabot firm highly enough.\n\nAlan Karbelnig PhD, ABPP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Discover hot stocks and investing tips from Cabot analysts in our free Cabot Wealth Daily newsletter delivered right to your inbox.\n    \n\n\n\n\n            We understand your email address is private.

Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look. The Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d  In this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space. In this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).

Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales.

The stock closed up nearly 1% in its first day following the split. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they now own 40 shares post-split. Stock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings.   CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS \"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"  Nvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company. Shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.   That sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. Nvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.  And Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform, called Blackwell Ultra, is coming in 2025 as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.92 -2.61 (-2.19%)  As of 3:00:30 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA INTC AMD   Advanced Chart    Stock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.   Story Continues On average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.Notably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Nvidia shares are up about 27% since the company announced its split on May 22. Nvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.It's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.What's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

This move increased the number of Nvidia shares tenfold, while the company\u2019s valuation remained the same. \nInvestors favor these moves for more flexibility and attractive options trading. Here\u2019s more on why I think Nvidia\u2019s recent stock split could be a good thing from the global chip giant.\n10 for 1 Stock Split\nStock splits allow investors and prospects to buy shares of a company at a more affordable price, without affecting existing shareholders\u2019 holdings. \nMatt Amberson of Option Research & Technology Services stated that Nvidia\u2019s split would make the stock more accessible to retail traders. Expect higher trading volumes due to Nvidia\u2019s implied volatility. With a bullish market, there could be more upside until the rally ends.\nThe split took place after Nvidia already overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world\u2019s second most valuable company, reaching a $3 trillion market cap. NVDA stock has continued to rise because of the growing interest in generative AI. \nBig Tech companies all around the world are looking to compete with Nvidia on the hardware and software front, but for now, most have been forced to work with Nvidia\u2019s hardware to support its AI innovations.\nNvidia\u2019s Q1 revenue skyrocketed, with adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 coming on $26 billion in revenue, up 461% and 262% respectively. Data Center revenue jumped 427% to $22.6 billion, dominating 86% of total revenue. C\nEO Jensen Huang announced new platforms, Blackwell Ultra for 2025, Rubin for 2026, and Rubin Ultra for 2027, to drive future growth.\nHow Will a Stock Split Impact NVDA Stock?\nStock splits signal strength to investors, often leading companies to outperform the S &  500 post-announcement. \nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months after a split announcement, compared to the S &  500\u2019s 12% return, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Nvidia shares have risen 27% since announcing their split on May 22.\nThe stock split also happened after a tight competition with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), who also introduced their latest AI chip. Nvidia customers are also making their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia. \nNvidia\u2019s market is expanding beyond tech firms to include government and research institutions, indicating further growth potential.\nPossible Dow Inclusion\nThe stock split aimed to lower per-share value, making Nvidia more affordable for employees and investors, while increasing outstanding shares without affecting market valuation.\u00a0\nBen Laidler from eToro noted the split could position Nvidia to join the Dow, potentially replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Various experts have cautioned that Nvidia might experience buyer exhaustion following the split.\nFollowing the split, Nvidia\u2019s stock traded at $120 per share, down from $1,200 on Friday, making it a potential candidate for the Dow index. An S &  Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman declined to comment on index changes.\nNVDA Stock Remains a Strong Buy\nNvidia\u2019s extraordinary growth stems largely from the soaring demand for its AI chips. In fiscal 2024, the data center segment contributed $47.5 billion of its $60.9 billion revenue. And in Q1 of fiscal 2025, data center revenue surged 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, indicating robust growth.\u00a0\nIn 2021, Nvidia also took on a stock split that improved share appreciation among investors. The 4-for-1 split began in July of that year, and since then, Nvidia\u2019s stock saw a 706% rise.\nFor those looking for a company that\u2019s not short on catalysts right now, Nvidia is it. I think the company\u2019s stock split is just the latest reason investors want to consider this highflying stock. Until something changes, this is the company investors want to own long-term.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductor \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2024/06/is-nvidia-nvda-a-buy-after-its-recent-stock-split/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Popular\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 10, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBig Tech\u2019s Quantum War Has Begun \u2014 and One Tiny Stock Could Win It\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 5, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat to Make of the Weakening Economy and Trade War\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestors Applaud a Cool Inflation Print\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow to Escape the \u2018Tyranny of the Immediate\u2019 in Investing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExpert Stock Picks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 12, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe System Flagging a Potential 50X Opportunity\u2026 Even in This Ugly Market\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout InvestorPlace\nProducts\nContact Us\nHelp\nCareers\nAdvertise With Us\nDisclosures & Disclaimers\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nTerms of Use\nDMCA Policy\n All rights reserved.

Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader dropped 6.7% on Monday to close at $118.11. This was the third consecutive trading day that shares declined, bringing the total pullback to 12.9% since the stock closed at an all-time high of $135.58 last Tuesday. (The market was closed on Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday.)\n\nNvidia stock's pullback in perspective\nNvidia stock has merely given up its gains from less than the last two weeks. Shares on Monday closed at their highest level since Tuesday, June 14. Moreover, despite the pullback, the stock is still up 139% so far this year, 180% over the one-year period, and 519% over the last three years.\nStocks never go straight up forever. There will always be pullbacks of varying magnitudes. Given Nvidia stock's rapid run-up, it's no surprise some investors are taking some profits off the table.\n\nCisco Systems stock price (purple) has still not reached the level of its peak in early 2000. The orange line is the stock's total return, which assumes dividends have been reinvested. Data by YCharts.\nNvidia stock is not like Cisco Systems stock before the dot-com bubble burst\nIn April, I wrote about the main qualitative differences between Nvidia stock now and Cisco Systems stock before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. That article was in response to a good number of articles comparing the two situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that Nvidia stock is pulling back, more of these Cisco-Nvidia type of comparisons are probably coming. This article delves into two key quantitative differences between the two situations.\nMargins: Key quantitative difference No. 1\nCisco stock skyrocketed in the 1990s despite the company's gross, operating, and profit margins steadily shrinking for many years. It's no surprise that Cisco stock plummeted when the dot-com bubble burst because its rise was not supported by the company's business performance.\n\nGross margin also steadily declined; it's not shown for ease of viewing the chart. Data by YCharts.\nA main reason for any company's margins to decline is increased competition stemming from moats that are not sufficient to keep competitors at bay. Indeed, in its annual reports, Cisco attributed \"continued pricing pressure seen from competitors in certain product areas\" as a key reason for its gross margin decline from fiscal 1998 to fiscal 1999 and also from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's look at Nvidia's stock and margin performances.\n\nData by YCharts.\nNvidia stock's surge has been supported by expanding margins. Granted, the company had a recent year-plus period where margins declined, but that was due to the macroeconomic environment, and its margins have since come roaring back. Over the long term, Nvidia's margins have trended upward -- and currently, they are at record highs.\nStock Valuation: Key quantitative difference No. 2\nThe PEG is a much better stock valuation metric than the more commonly used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio because it takes a company's earnings growth into account. A stock's PEG is calculated by dividing its P/E ratio by the company's earnings growth. For instance, if a stock's P/E is 40 and a company's earnings per share increased 40% over the last year, its PEG is 1.0. As a rough rule of thumb, a PEG of 1.0 indicates a stock is about fairly valued, while PEGs over 1.0 suggest a stock could be overvalued. That said, PEGs will vary considerably by industry and other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData by YCharts.\nCisco's stock was very overvalued for most of its trading history before the stock reached its all-time high in March 2000. Its valuation was particularly bloated in 1999, the year before its stock plunged. Its PEG was over 7.5 in early 1999, and then it had no PEG (which means that earnings or earnings growth were negative), and then its PEG surged above 9 very soon before the stock's crash.\n\nData by YCharts.\nNvidia's current PEG is well under 1.0. What its really low PEG is telling us is that, collectively, the market expects that Nvidia's near-term earnings growth will significantly slow. No doubt, it won't be able up to keep up the torrid pace of its recent year-over-year earnings growth. That said, it seems to me that the market is underestimating Nvidia's earnings growth potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted, Nvidia's data center platform's powerful growth will slow down. But AI is still in the early innings, so this AI-driven platform still has huge growth potential. Moreover, Nvidia is not a one-trick pony. Self-driving cars are coming -- and when they fully arrive, Nvidia's auto platform's revenue and earnings should soar.\nDespite all the headlines over many years proclaiming Nvidia stock being very overvalued, that's just not been the case. At least not for more than relatively brief periods.\nNvidia stock's pullback is not driven by fundamentals\nThe key thing for long-term investors to remember: Nothing has changed fundamentally for Nvidia since its stock hit an all-time high last week. The company's long-term growth prospects and AI's long-term growth prospects remain unchanged.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

But soon, one of tech\u2019s high flyers may hit $4 trillion.\nApple (AAPL): Deepwater\u2019s Gene Munster said Apple had its biggest day since 2007.\u00a0\nMicrosoft (MSFT): It\u2019s my top pick to hit the $4 trillion valuation first.\u00a0\nNvidia (NVDA): The announcement of Rubin may be fuel for the euphoric rally.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSource: Serhii Milekhin / Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nThe race to $4 trillion is on. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are members of the $3 trillion club, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just fell out of the club following its Monday plunge of nearly 2%.\nSo, which technology behemoth can adapt to keep growth rates elevated enough to keep the good times going? Undoubtedly, Nvidia\u2019s blistering triple-digit sales growth puts the GPU kingpin on another planet.\nThis initial artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator gold rush will cool down. And when it does, questions linger about the kind of sustained growth rate that Nvidia will settle into. If there is a downturn in the future, it will be almost impossible to time.\nWhile triple-digit growth is simply unsustainable, perhaps Nvidia has a few more upside surprises in store for those holding on at today\u2019s meteoric highs. \nAfter all, many analysts have been guilty of underestimating the company in the past three years. Whether they\u2019re continuing to underestimate the magnitude of the boom remains the $4 trillion question.\nApple (AAPL)\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\nHow could Apple be the first to hit a $4 trillion valuation when the firm has been outrun by Microsoft and Nvidia of late?\nThough many consider Apple to be an underdog in the race to $4 trillion, the worst of the company\u2019s iPhone sales hiccups may have already passed. As interest rates begin to fall, perhaps more discretionary income in consumers\u2019 pockets will give way to a splurge on new devices.\nIf anything, the latest iPhones, iPads and Macs are not discretionary goods anymore, not when they can run Apple Intelligence using Apple\u2019s hybrid approach to AI computing.\nAdditionally, some notable bulls are out following Apple\u2019s big WWDC day, including Deepwater Asset Management\u2019s Gene Munster. Recently, the latter sat down with CNBC to share his thoughts. He thought the first day of WWDC 2024 (June 10) was the biggest day for Apple since 2007, the day Apple unveiled the first iPhone.\nIf Munster is right, Apple could find itself at a $4 trillion market cap. That\u2019s just a 36% rally for AAPL stock from here, which is totally attainable given the soft year-to-date (YTD) rally of just 4%.\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\nMicrosoft is technically the closest to hitting that $4 trillion market cap mark. At writing, the stock is sitting at just north of $3 trillion. The road to $4 trillion may be less traveled for Microsoft at current levels. Yet, it would be a mistake to discount the potential for Nvidia or Apple to make a second-half sprint to such a finish line.\nIn any case, some smart analysts see Microsoft rising to a valuation of $4 trillion, thanks in part to its drivers that span well beyond generative AI.\nMost notably, the Azure cloud business, which stands to benefit from greater AI usage as a whole, could be next in line to excite. Pierre Ferragu of NewStreet Research thinks a $4 trillion valuation makes sense as Microsoft seeks \u201cachieving the Nirvana of execution.\u201d That entails \u201chigher profitability\u201d and \u201crapid and steady market share gains.\u201d\nTruly, fast and steady may ultimately win the market cap race. And MSFT stock has the best shot at rallying enough to mint Microsoft as the first to break a $4 trillion valuation. A gain of around 26% from today\u2019s close will do it.\nNvidia (NVDA)\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\nNvidia is probably the favorite pick for many to hit the $4 trillion valuation level first. At around $3 trillion, it will take a surge of just over 33% to hit the level. \nNVDA stock has rallied more than 35% in just the past month. If AI enthusiasm continues, Nvidia could be flirting with $4 trillion in a matter of weeks. Of course, just how much exciting news can flow in for the summer when we\u2019ve already had so much to admire in the first half?\nAlready, Nvidia is thinking years ahead with its Rubin platform for 2026. It\u2019s not just the GPU that has investors\u2019 attention. It\u2019s the next-generation Vera chip built on the Rubin platform that could capture the world by storm. \nThere\u2019s only one problem with the Rubin news. It\u2019s likely already (mostly) baked in, and we\u2019re going to have to wait more than a year and a half before the chip launches. That\u2019s a long wait. And NVDA stock could certainly consolidate until Rubin launches.\nFinally, Rubin\u2019s hype may bring forward a bit of excitement and upside this year, perhaps taking away from NVDA stock\u2019s future performance.

Less than 24 hours ago, following the close of trading on Friday, June 7, the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), completed its 10-for-1 forward split. A \"stock split\" is an event which allows publicly traded companies to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's cosmetic in the sense that stock splits have no effect on a company's market cap or operating performance. Stock splits can make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors, as with a forward-stock split. They can also increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange, as seen with a reverse-stock split.  Investors have been gravitating to stock-split stocks over the last three years because they have a history of outperforming. More than a dozen high-flying stocks have announced and/or enacted forward-stock splits since the midpoint of 2021, including Nvidia, which just completed its second split since July 2021.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia has gained $2.68 trillion in market value in a little over 17 months On paper, Nvidia has given investors every reason to hop aboard and enjoy the ride. On June 5, Nvidia's market cap topped $3 trillion for the first time, with the company surpassing Apple for the No. 2 spot among America's largest publicly traded companies. Since 2023 began, Nvidia has added roughly $2.68 trillion in market value, which has entirely been driven by AI. Nvidia's AI-inspired graphics processing units (GPUs) are the cornerstone of high-compute data centers. Based on varied estimates, Nvidia's chips account for around 90% of AI-GPU market share, with the ultra-popular H100 GPU powering generative AI solutions and helping to train large language models.  Nvidia's innovative advantage is driving gains, too. The company's next-generation Blackwell chip, which costs between $30,000 to $40,000, is believed by some Wall Street analysts to be sold out well into 2025. With demand overwhelming supply, Nvidia has had no trouble raising the price of its AI-GPUs and reaping the rewards of a massive uptick in gross margin -- 78.35% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 28. Despite Nvidia's stock gaining 738% in a little over 17 months, it still appears reasonably cheap on a fundamental basis. Although shares are currently trading at roughly 34 times forward-year earnings, Wall Street's consensus calls for an annualized earnings growth rate of 46.5% over the next five years.   Story Continues On the surface, Nvidia looks perfect following its 10-for-1 stock split. But as an investor, I can't judge a book solely by its cover.  Image source: Getty Images.  History suggests Nvidia may be a ticking time bombTaking a step back, widening the lens, and allowing history to be my guide leads to a completely different investment view of Nvidia over the months and/or years to come. While there's no denying that it's been firing on all cylinders and handily surpassing even the loftiest expectations thrown its way by Wall Street analysts, there are a handful of reasons why I wouldn't touch Nvidia stock with a 10-foot pole in the wake of its 10-for-1 split.The primary reason I want nothing to do with Nvidia has to do with the history of next-big-thing innovations.Since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, Wall Street has had no shortage of next-in-line trends that were expected to change the growth arc for corporate America. Some of these innovations include genome decoding, the rise of nanotechnology, business-to-business commerce, 3D printing, blockchain technology, the metaverse, and now, artificial intelligence.While some of these trends were successful over the long run, they all share one thing in common (save for AI): an early stage bubble-bursting event. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new technologies and innovations for more than 30 years. Every game-changing innovation comes with immense promise and lofty analyst expectations. Unfortunately, every new innovation needs time to mature -- and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. If and when the AI bubble bursts, there isn't a company that's going to take it on the chin more than Nvidia.Mind you, I have no clue when the AI bubble could burst. History has shown that stock valuations can remain extended for years before correcting. But eventually (key word!), we've witnessed every new innovation navigate its way through a bubble-popping event.We're also beginning to see subtle \"warnings\" from Nvidia that the peak is here or nearby.If you were to scour Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter operating results and conference call, you'd find nothing but positive commentary from its management team. However, the company's fiscal second-quarter gross margin guidance of 75.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, is the red flag I speak of.  NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.  After increasing its gross margin by 13.8 percentage points in a year, a forecast decline of 235 to 335 basis points (78.35% to a range of 75% to 76%) might sound like a nothingburger. But it's noteworthy when you consider that external competitors are hitting the ground running with AI-GPUs of their own. Furthermore, Nvidia's top four customers, which account for roughly 40% of its sales, are internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers.This forecast decline in sequential quarterly gross margin would appear to signal that Nvidia's pricing power has peaked. If GPU scarcity wanes, Nvidia's pricing power will taper, too.The third reason I want nothing to do with Nvidia following its now-complete 10-for-1 stock split is, once again, history -- but this time I'm talking about its valuation.As I noted earlier, Nvidia is still relatively inexpensive, based on the price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio). But on the basis of trailing 12-month (TTM) sales, Nvidia has reached a level of historic priciness that rivals only Amazon and Cisco Systems prior to the dot-com bubble bursting.In late March 2000, Cisco Systems peaked at just shy of 39 times TTM sales. Meanwhile, Amazon topped 43 times TTM sales in January 1999 before falling off a cliff. Nvidia is currently sitting at a multiple of 38 times TTM sales.History may not repeat perfectly on Wall Street, but it does have a tendency to rhyme. For those reasons, I'm not touching this artificial intelligence titan with a 10-foot pole.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

While the company currently sits in third place in terms of global market capitalization, shares of NVDA stock have been driving a significant portion of the returns of the overall market for some time now. That\u2019s unlikely to change anytime soon.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) catalysts driving Nvidia to new all-time highs seemingly on a daily basis are in full flight. In fact, NVDA stock made another all-time high today, surging more than 3% this afternoon ahead of a key upcoming event.\nOn June 26, the company will host its annual meeting. The company just released its annual review and proxy statement, which many are parsing through right now.\nLet\u2019s dive into what\u2019s up for discussion and a vote at this meeting \u2014 and why investors appear to be growing even more bullish on this semiconductor giant.\nNVDA Stock Surges Ahead of Annual Meeting\nNvidia shareholders will certainly be watching the company\u2019s presentation and commentary, looking for any new announcements around future products being launched as well as current uptake and demand predictions moving forward. Given the possibility of many new pieces of information being shared \u2014 and the bullish tilt of the market right now \u2014 it should be no surprise the largest chip stock in the world is moving higher ahead of this event.\nNvidia will host its annual shareholder meeting at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time virtually via its website. Investors will be asked to vote on the following items:\n\nThe election of 12 directors nominated by the company\u2019s board.\nAdvisory approval of Nvidia\u2019s executive compensation packages.\nA ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm.\nOther business items, including stockholder proposals, as they arise.\n\nAs mentioned, these business items will likely take a back seat to the company\u2019s presentations and announcements.

Citi also kept a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on NVDA. The bank believes that the chipmaker will benefit from strong demand from companies and government agencies for artificial intelligence (AI) \u201cagents.\u201d\nWhat Are AI Agents?\nAI agents are AI-powered assistants that carry out certain tasks. Eventually, the revenue from the chips that power these tools will account for nearly 50% of the sales of Nvidia\u2019s data-center unit, Citi believes.\nThese assistants acquire knowledge from the data they analyze and make their own decisions. They can also take actions independently. According to Citi, the agents aren\u2019t yet totally reliable, but they can already perform some tasks better than humans.\nNvidia\u2019s \u201cRetrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d platform could constitute the core of these agents. Citi believes that AI adoption is only about a third of the way to completion.\nStartups Are Aiming to Take Market Share From Nvidia\nBarron\u2019s is noting today that multiple startups are looking to move in on Nvidia\u2019s turf. Etched, which raised $120 million, has created chips that it says are \u201cfaster and cheaper\u201d than Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell offerings. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) co-founder Peter Thiel has invested in the firm.\nAnd poised to soon be valued at $2.5 billion, Groq\u2019s chips power AI inference. According to the startup, its chips are superior to those of Nvidia when it comes to enabling AI\u00a0language\u00a0applications.\nMeanwhile, Barron\u2019s also warned that Nvidia\u2019s shares could \u201ceasily\u201d drop to $102.29, which represents its 50-day moving average.\nThe Price Action of NVDA Stock\nHeading into today, the shares had dropped 7% in the last five days, but they were still up 10% in the preceding month and 40% in the last three months.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Over the past year, the stock has risen a remarkable 165% due to accelerated growth related to heavy investing in artificial intelligence (AI) across the technology space.\nBut it's not alone in creating massive investment returns. Arm Holdings (ARM -1.10%) is no slouch, either; its shares are up more than 120%. That leaves investors with an excellent dilemma: Which is the better AI stock to own?\nIt turns out that one is far more likely to continue its run than the other.\u00a0Which one? Here is what you need to know.\n\nBoth companies play crucial roles in AI\nThe strong momentum behind both stocks underlines each company's key role in AI. It's unclear what that technology might look like 5 or 10 years from now, but there's a strong chance that Nvidia and Arm Holdings will be in the thick of it.\nNvidia's AI chips have become, more or less, the building blocks of AI technology. AI language models like ChatGPT train on massive data centers with thousands of chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nChips from Nvidia specialize in demanding, high-compute applications. These traits are perfect for AI, and the company has done a great job optimizing its chips and software for it.\nCompanies investing to build these AI models have all gravitated to Nvidia, giving the company an estimated 90% market share for AI chips. It's unclear when (or if) it will lose its stranglehold on the chip market.\n\nArm Holdings is arguably the gold standard for computer chip design. Its central processing unit (CPU) architecture is the foundation for roughly half the world's computer chips. That footprint includes smartphones, vehicles, computers, and more.\nArm makes money by charging royalties and licensing fees on each chip that uses its intellectual property. That includes Nvidia's next-generation Grace series of data center CPUs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Nvidia and Arm Holdings will likely have a big say in the future of AI.\nAI is already benefiting both businesses\nBoth companies are already seeing the impact of AI on their business. Nvidia and Arm are highly profitable, and the accelerated sales growth is lining each company's coffers:\n\nNVDA free cash flow (percentage of quarterly revenue); data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nArm's business has proved to be more profitable; the company's primary expense is research and development. Roughly $0.70 of every revenue dollar winds up as free cash flow. But Arm is a much smaller company than Nvidia. Its trailing-12-month sales are just over $3.2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia isn't quite as efficient as Arm in converting sales to cash flow, but it's bringing in far more revenue: nearly $80 billion over the past year.\nNvidia's ability to sell a physical product at such high margins is impressive, and that is why it will generate far more cash flow than Arm over the long term. More cash flow gives a company more options. Nvidia even came close to buying Arm Holdings before the company went public, but the merger fell through. Give Nvidia the edge here for its comparable profitability at a much larger size.\nThe gap widens when talking about valuation\nAnalysts are equally optimistic about both companies' earnings growth over the coming years. Consensus long-term estimates call for roughly 31% annualized earnings growth for both Nvidia and Arm. However, you can see below that the starting valuation for each is dramatically different:\n\nNVDA PE ratio (forward) data by YCharts; PE = price to earnings, EPS = earnings per share.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that is half as expensive\u00a0as Arm Holdings', Nvidia stock has a built-in margin of safety. Assuming growth estimates prove accurate, Nvidia is far more likely to perform better.\nAs they say, the higher they go, the further they can fall. High valuations leave less room for things to go wrong. Arm Holdings could perform exceptionally well as a business, and something -- even something external to the company, like broader market volatility -- could send shares lower.\nNvidia and Arm Holdings are blue chip technology stocks with a bright future in AI due to their exceptional competitive footing. However, given the dramatic difference in valuation, Nvidia seems like the better AI stock to buy today.\n\n\n\nJustin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

While investing heavily in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could keep the cash coming in (considering its recent performance), there\u2019s a more cost-effective strategy to leverage Nvidia\u2019s growth: investing in Nvidia partner stocks, which stand to benefit from Nvidia\u2019s expansive influence across various industries.  Nvidia collaborates with a broad network of subcontractors and manufacturers, essential for producing and distributing its advanced technologies. By identifying and investing in these Nvidia partner stocks, you can diversify your portfolio beyond direct Nvidia investments and tap into broader industry trends. Moreover, these Nvidia partner stocks often come at a lower price point than Nvidia\u2019s shares, offering a valuable opportunity for those seeking bargains in the AI sector. This approach lets you capture Nvidia\u2019s upside while mitigating the risks of investing in a single high-priced stock. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX)   Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) website displayed on a modern smartphone   Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX)) shares surged last year as one of the first Nvidia partner stocks to make major waves, sparked by a significant $50 million investment from Nvidia. However, since reaching a peak that month, RXRX\u2019s stock has sharply declined, now trading at about half of its 2023 peak. Despite the downturn, Nvidia\u2019s enthusiasm for Recursion remains unchanged. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Recursion leverages AI technology to rapidly and accurately identify cross-gene relationships and interactions within its vast and continuously growing genetic dataset. The standout feature of their platform is its capability to shorten drug discovery timelines through generative AI processes significantly. Traditionally, drug discovery is a lengthy and complex process that involves determining which compound combinations are effective in gene interactions.  Manually managing this process involves navigating through millions of data points, which can be as daunting as finding a needle in a haystack. Recursion\u2019s innovative and effective AI platform has the potential to revolutionize therapeutic development. With Nvidia\u2019s backing, Recursion not only gains a strategic partner but also stands poised to capitalize on this transformative approach to drug discovery. Fabrinet (FN)   computer chip, technology   Source: iStockphoto Fabrinet (NYSE:FN) manufactures precision electronic and technical subcomponents, similar to how automotive manufacturers outsource parts like doors before assembling the final vehicle. In this analogy, Fabrinet supplies critical components such as optical communication parts and advanced lasers to major firms, including Nvidia and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).   Story Continues The rapid growth of the semiconductor and artificial intelligence sectors will continue boosting Fabrinet significantly \u2014 not to mention its longstanding relationship with Nvidia. Following a few strong quarters, analysts revised price targets for Fabrinet as high as $260, reflecting AI\u2019s continued market strength and benefit to Nvidia partner stocks. Shares surged 25% since January, but the company continues to trade below the new price target.While Nvidia contributes 13% of Fabrinet\u2019s revenue, the company\u2019s prospects are not solely tied to one client. Many AI and data communication firms are turning to Fabrinet for its specialized manufacturing capabilities. Ultimately, Fabrinet\u2019s success among Nvidia partner stocks isn\u2019t solely contingent on Nvidia\u2019s success; it also stands to gain from the sector\u2019s continued growth.SoundHound AI (SOUN)  Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.  Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comI first looked at small-cap tech stock SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) in November 2023, well before it took place among Nvidia partner stocks. Since then, the core thesis supporting its unique position remains unchanged, but the stock has gained new popularity among investors.The big picture bull case is that SoundHound is on the brink of significant growth as it carves a niche in the underexplored voice recognition sector. The market for voice recognition technology is expanding, as demonstrated by SoundHound\u2019s applications in enhancing restaurant efficiency. Companies like SoundHound show that their market reach depends on how effectively they adapt their technology to meet diverse needs rather than trying to target their market narrowly.Recently, Nvidia underscored SoundHound\u2019s potential and brought it into the Nvidia partner stocks club by making a multi-million-dollar investment in the company. Nvidia had previously participated in SoundHound\u2019s $75 million funding round in 2017 and staked another $3.7 million in the stock in March. First investing well before the current AI hype, Nvidia\u2019s ongoing support indicates a long-term interest in SoundHound\u2019s trajectory. Continued backing from Nvidia suggests a bright future for SoundHound, and its status among Nvidia partner stocks remains strong.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

This has the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.22% on Monday afternoon.\nThat\u2019s worth pointing out, as it\u2019s the only one of the three major exchanges slipping today. The S&P 500 is up 0.31%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.85% at that same time.\nInvestors will also note that this marks the third day of trading in a row that NVDA stock is falling. This could be a sign that the shares are losing some of the steam gained in the first half of 2024.\nWhat\u2019s Hitting NVDA Stock?\nIt\u2019s less that specific news is pulling NVDA stock down today and more that market sentiment is moving away from the artificial intelligence (AI) company. This comes as other concerns, such as the 2024 presidential election and the upcoming personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index release, take center stage.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that despite these recent drops, Wall Street remains positive on Nvidia. That could be a sign that the slips seen these last few days aren\u2019t anything for traders to worry about.\nAfter all, NVDA stock is up 151.2% since the start of the year.\nInvestors will want to stick around for even more of the most recent stock market stories!\nWe have all of the hottest stock market news that traders need to know about on Monday! That includes all of the latest news for MicroAlgo\u00a0(NASDAQ:MLGO) stock, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock and Nio\u00a0(NYSE:NIO) stock.

But if any name can overcome those costs, and benefit it\u2019s Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock.\nMeta has just launched an AI chatbot, based on its Llama 3 language model, in India. Like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), it\u2019s based on what Meta does best. It uses your personal data.\nThe chatbot will help Meta collect data and build traffic. The release on it uses examples of Americans using the technology. It\u2019s important to know how others will use it, if we\u2019re to grow it.\nBut there\u2019s a lot more to the Meta AI story than that.\nAI and Meta Stock\nMeta runs its own data centers. It is attuned to the need for efficiency and has a global footprint. All these will help it bring AI to the developing world.\nThe model has already made Meta stock uniquely profitable. It doesn\u2019t pay for data and controls its own infrastructure. Think of it as a Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) among Cloud Czars.\nDuring the first quarter, Meta was able to bring one-third of $36.5 billion in revenue to the net income line. Its capital budget this year will be $35-40 billion and it now pays a small dividend.\nYet despite being up almost 50% in 2024, Meta stock is not super-expensive, for a Cloud Czar. Hit next year\u2019s earnings estimate and you have a forward price to earnings ratio of just 22. \nMeta also has a unique AI model. Meta is using an open source approach. It doesn\u2019t charge for downloading and tweaking its code. The more eyes on the prize, the bigger it gets.\nMeta models won\u2019t make what seem like the intuitive leaps of rivals, but over time they will adapt and become secure. \nMeta\u2019s data centers allow for maximum energy efficiency in model delivery. Since it isn\u2019t charging for basic services, its usage ceiling is unlimited.\nMeta Data is Free\nA lot is being made of Meta delaying its European AI plans due to objections from regulators. Meta doesn\u2019t need Europe. There\u2019s a fire hose of data coming from India, Southeast Asia, Africa, and from South America.\nOpen source is benefiting Meta in other ways. Its Threads service is catching X, formerly Twitter, by tying itself to the open source Fediverse. Over time, Threads will be integrated with the open source ActivityPub model in 100 countries, adding to the fire hose of incoming data.\nThis is the key to what Meta, and most great companies, do. It copies innovation, manages it better, and spreads its reach around the world. It copied Snapchat with Stories. It\u2019s copying TikTok with Reels. \nEverything in these services becomes training data. It reaches its maximum audience because it\u2019s free and available, thanks to Meta\u2019s network of data centers. When Kenya\u2019s Internet was cut over tax protests, Facebook\u2019s sites kept working.\nAlphabet is the only other Cloud Czar approaching this model, since it uses search data and gets YouTube videos free. But Alphabet has chosen a higher-cost path with its Gemini AI and will soon begin charging users for it. If truth is behind a paywall, it can\u2019t get its pants on.\nWhat\u2019s left of the media, its business model wrecked by Meta, is starting to take notice of its power. The New York Times reports that CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who finally turned 40 in March, is popular again. This is thanks to Meta\u2019s open source approach.\nNote that Meta doesn\u2019t open source its services, as Ben Thompson of Strategery writes. It uses open source for low-level infrastructure, to cut its costs. It then uses these lower costs to deliver things of value at a lower price point. There\u2019s no price point lower than free.\nThe Bottom Line\nMeta has been running the same game since Facebook copied Google\u2019s data center innovations with its Open Compute Project 12 years ago.\nAmong the Cloud Czars, Meta stock is the best bet for a long-term investor.\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in NVDA.

The company\u2019s high-performance chips power most companies building new applications in this space, and NVDA stock has benefited from some of the most robust secular tailwinds. \nHowever, there are plenty of other catalysts investors are pricing in today. On Friday, after the market closed, the company took on a 10-for-1 stock split, with the stock maintaining strong momentum in the move. Analysts are now chiming in on this split and what it means for the stock, with several firms raising their price targets for the company.\nLet\u2019s dive into these upgrades and what they may mean for investors moving forward.\nNVDA Stock Moves Higher on Analyst Upgrades, Stock Split\nDuring this recent tech-driven bull market, stock splits have been catalysts for a number of high-flying stocks. As a given stock price surges, certain investors get priced out of the market due to restrictions at some brokerages and trading houses that require investors to purchase whole shares of given companies. Additionally, companies that take on stock splits can better incentivize employees with stock, and these splits can typically lead to a broader investor base over time.\nNvidia is likely to continue to benefit from sovereign purchases of AI chips, as well as wider-spread corporate adoption of these chips. As Nvidia\u2019s order backlog increases, the company\u2019s revenue and profit growth potential appears to be only restricted by production capacity at this point in time. For Nvidia, that\u2019s likely to lead to even greater growth than many analysts have already priced in. \nFor these reasons and others, analysts from Barclays, Susquehanna and TD Cowen increased their price targets on Nvidia. Barclays raised its target to $145 (from $120), Susquehanna did the same, and TD Cowen analysts raised their target to $140 from $120 as well. With Nvidia now trading above these analysts\u2019 previous price targets, this upgrade certainly makes sense.\nFor now, analysts certainly appear to be chasing the stock and have only been correct in upgrading it over time. Until the incredibly high demand for NVDA stock slows down, we\u2019re likely to see more upgrades moving forward.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.Artificial Intelligence, Semiconductor, Technology \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2024/06/barclays-just-raised-its-price-target-on-nvidia-nvda-stock/.\n\u00a92025 InvestorPlace Media, LLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Headlines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMore from InvestorPlace\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot Stocks\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Top Stocks to Buy Under Trump Come From Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018BRAIN\u2019\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Luke Lango, InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Danger that Could Derail Our Economy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Jeff Remsburg, Contributing Editor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarket Analysis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Prediction Came True: Where to Find Opportunity Despite Market Unpredictability\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy Eric Fry, Editor, Fry's Investment Report\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMar 17, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTop Stories\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeb 8, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWolfpack Research Short Report Sends B.

That\u2019s a 27% potential increase compared to the stock\u2019s prior closing price. It\u2019s also above the analyst consensus estimate of $122.13 per share.\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that Jefferies continues to have a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for NVDA stock. That matches up with the analyst consensus rating based on 44 opinions.\nWhat\u2019s Behind the New NVDA Price Target\nHere\u2019s what Curtis said about NVDA stock in a note to clients obtained by StreetInsider:\n\n\u201cWe still think it\u2019s too early to call any losers for 2025, but we do see growing concern for AMD\u2019s pipeline. NVDA remains both king and kingmaker \u2013 for example, we still see growth for MRVL and ALAB alongside NVDA, but NVDA\u2019s decisions on each generation could materially alter that.\u201d\n\nNVDA stock is up 3% as of Tuesday morning. That comes with more than 124 million shares traded. This is still well below its daily average trading volume of about 440 million shares.\nInvestors on the lookout for more of the most recent stock market stories are going to want to stick around!\nWe have all of the hottest stock market news ready to go on Tuesday!

Indeed, just weeks after overtaking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company, Truist believes the runway is just opening up for Nvidia.\n\u201cWe considered that, even if fundamentals cooperate, stock upside could be limited owing to trading and technical challenges related to NVDA\u2019s #1 market cap position,\u201d Truist analysts noted.\nInterestingly, Truist found that becoming the largest company by market capitalization doesn\u2019t actually affect anticipated returns on investment.\nIndeed, the data suggests that \u201cbecoming the largest company by market cap does not appear to systematically challenge future investment returns.\u201d\nIn their analysis of other companies that have grabbed the number-one spot, Truist found that, while firms initially stagnate in their stock performance relative to the S&P 500, the stocks generally outperform the benchmark index over the long term.\nTruist analysts maintain their view that Nvidia is the top choice for investing in the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy, citing the chipmaker\u2019s \u201cindustry contacts\u201d and expanding demand for its GPU architecture.\nNVDA Stock Continues to Rise on AI Craze\nNVDA stock has enjoyed a groundbreaking year in 2024. The AI frenzy has pushed the chipmaker to becoming the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Indeed, shares of NVDA are up 156% so far this year, with Nvidia having added billions to its market cap just six months into 2024.\nNot for nothing, Nvidia\u2019s quarterly earnings performance has been nothing short of excellent. Indeed, in its April earnings report, the company handily beat revenue, net income, EPS and guidance estimates.\nWith AI stocks leading this year, Nvidia is poised to continue surging as one of the largest producers of data center-optimized semiconductors.\nOn the date of publication, Shrey Dua held a LONG position in NVDA.

What Does It Mea\u2026ImportantExclusiveNVDA: Nvidia Big 10-for-1 Stock Split Completed. What Does It Mean for Traders?NVDAKey points:Nvidia splits its stock 10 for 1.  1 share is now 10 at lower price.  Stock is now more affordable.  Illustration by TradingViewIf you woke up to a 90% drawdown in your Nvidia share price, don\u2019t panic \u2014 look at your share count, not the price. Nvidia stock NVDA just wiped out 90% of its share price. But don\u2019t panic! It\u2019s all part of a planned stock split, which saw 1 share turn into 10. The chip giant\u2019s 10-for-1 stock split took effect after Friday\u2019s closing bell. This means that if you had 1 share on Friday worth $1,208.88 now you have 10 shares, each worth $120.89. Nvidia finished its first post-split session higher by 0.8%.  A stock split doesn\u2019t do anything to the market cap, which is what you should be looking at when trying to evaluate If a company\u2019s valuation is overblown. To this end, Nvidia\u2019s market cap remained untouched, floating above $3 trillion. What happened is Nvidia flooded the market with a boatload of new shares issued so that each share pre-split could be joined by nine more shares, thus diluting the share price.  Such an operation is usually performed when a company\u2019s valuation increases significantly and it balloons the share price, making it less appealing to individual traders and investors.

Nvidia (NVDA) is joining its megacap tech peers, becoming the fourth \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to split since 2022. The chip giant\u2019s 10-for-1 stock split, which will start trading on Monday, follows significant price growth, with shares up 212% in the past year. That massive rally pushed Nvidia into the $3 trillion club alongside Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), becoming just the third US company ever to reach that milestone.  \u201cA stock split is a vote of confidence from management that the stock will hold its value, as the stock [price] typically increases,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt said. Winthrop Capital chief investment officer Adam Coons expects the split to boost retail investor interest but cautioned that an influx of retail traders could trigger volatility for the stock. \u201cThey can be a little bit more quick and emotional with their buying and selling decisions, so that can lead to heightened volatility as you start to dilute the institutional buyers,\u201d Coons told Yahoo Finance. Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel sees increased volatility as an opportunity to buy Nvidia \u2014 a stock he views as a \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d and this era's \"marquee\" technology stock. \u201cWhile high profile splits have often fueled stock volatility \u2014 speculative buying and profit taking around the event \u2014 Thinning the trees within the forest post-split catalyzes the Buying Opportunity for the patient investor,\u201d Emanuel wrote in a client note. Historically, stock splits are typically bullish for the companies that enact them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broad market, according to analysis from Bank of America.   Nvidia\u2019s skyrocketing gains have driven the broader market to record highs. Its rally accounted for about a third of the S&P 500\u2019s return since the start of the year, and more than a quarter of the S&P 500\u2019s return in the month of May, according to Silverblatt. Wall Street has gotten even more bullish on the stock since its earnings report on May 22. Last week, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya raised his price target to a Street high of $1,500. \u201cWe are at the start of what I think would be a decade-long conversion to accelerated computing \u2026 We think that the spending could be anywhere between $250 [billion] to $500 billion a year, and Nvidia is leading the charge,\u201d Arya told Yahoo Finance. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.92 -2.61 (-2.19%)  As of 3:00:30 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA ^GSPC   Advanced Chart    Nvidia\u2019s stock split not only signals management\u2019s confidence in the chip giant but also enthusiasm and optimism about the broader artificial intelligence industry's growth potential.   Story Continues As Lam Research (LRCX) CFO Doug Bettinger explained to me at Bank of America\u2019s Global Technology conference earlier this week, we\u2019re still \u201cvery, very early\u201d in the AI investment cycle.That next round of growth \u2014 or the second wave of AI \u2014 is expected to take hold as companies begin to integrate AI into their planning and enterprise spending.\u201cMore and more companies are adopting hybrid-cloud architectures, and with a focus on building modern applications, and starting their journey into enterprise AI,\u201d Nutanix (NTNX) CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told me.For investors looking to add to their portfolios, Arya likes Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Micron (MU), and Arm (ARM) as winners of AI\u2019s continued wave. In a note to clients last month, Arya wrote that he sees increased requirements in computing, networking, and memory as a \u201cmultiyear growth driver\u201d for the group.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

That conversation, and the ones that followed, led to the founding of Nvidia, the tech company that soared through the ranks of the stock market to briefly top Microsoft as the most valuable company in the S&P 500 this week. The company is now worth over $3.2 trillion, with its dominance as a chipmaker cementing Nvidia\u2019s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom \u2014 a moment that Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, has dubbed \u201cthe next industrial revolution.\u201dOn a conference call with analysts last month, Huang predicted that the companies using Nvidia chips would build a new type of data center called \u201cAI factories.\u201d \n\nHuang added that training AI models is becoming a faster process as they learn to become \u201cmultimodal\u201d \u2014 able to understand text, speech, images, video and 3-D data \u2014 and also \u201cto reason and plan.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is turbocharging organized crime, EU police agency warns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArizona Supreme Court taps AI avatars to make the judicial system more publicly accessible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs AI nurses reshape hospital care, human nurses are pushing back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople kind of talk about AI as if Jensen just kind of arrived like in the last 18 months, like 24 months ago all of a sudden figured this out,\u201d said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \u201cBut if you actually go back in time and listen to Jensen talking about accelerated computing, he\u2019s been sharing his vision for more than a decade.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based tech company\u2019s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\n\nNvidia\u2019s GPUs are a key factor in the company\u2019s success in artificial intelligence, Newman added.\u201cThey took an architecture that was used for a single thing, to maybe enhance gaming, and they figured out how to network these things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe GPU became the most compelling architecture for AI, going from gaming, rendering graphics and stuff, to actually using it for data. ... They basically ended up creating a market that didn\u2019t exist, which was GPUs for AI, or GPUs for machine learning.\u201dAI chips are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently. While general-purpose chips like CPUs can also be used for simpler AI tasks, they\u2019re \u201cbecoming less and less useful as AI advances,\u201d a 2020 report from Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology found.Tech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI \u2014 a movement that\u2019s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music.\u201cJensen basically has made AI digestible and then Apple will make it consumable,\u201d Newman said.The company carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because Huang nudged it into what was still a nascent technology more than a decade ago. \n\n\u201cNvidia has been working on different portions of this problem for more than two decades now. They have a deep innovation engine that goes all the way back to the early 2000s,\u201d said Chirag Dekate, a VP analyst at Gartner, a tech research and consulting firm. \u201cWhat Nvidia did two decades ago is they both identified and they nurtured an adjacent market where they discovered that the same processors, same GPUs that they were using for graphics could be shaped to solve highly parallel tasks.\u201dAt the time, he said, AI was only in its infancy. But Nvidia\u2019s understanding that GPUs would be central to the development of AI was \u201cthe fundamental breakthrough that was needed,\u201d Dekate said. \u201cUntil then, we would have been, I would say, in the analytic Dark Ages,\u201d he said. \u201cThe analytics were there, but we could never bring these AI elements to life.\u201d\n\nAnalysts estimate that Nvidia\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025 will reach $119.9 billion \u2014 about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\u201cMy hypothesis is the kind of exponential growth that we\u2019re seeing with Nvidia today is potentially a pattern that we\u2019re going to see replicated more frequently in the decades to come,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Golden Age if you will...this is the best time to be an AI engineer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARAH PARVINI\n\n\n                Parvini covers artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.

History Says the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Do This Next (Hint: It May Shock You).      Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool   June 6, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will complete a 10-for-1 stock split after market close tomorrow. The split comes on the heels of tremendous price appreciation. Nvidia returned 205% during the past year and 580% during the last three years, with enthusiasm about artificial intelligence being the primary reason for those gains.  What does the split mean for investors? Shareholders will get nine additional shares for each share they own. The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, June 10. Importantly, the split will not impact the value of the company, nor will it change an investor's stake in the company. The big question is: What happens following the stock split? Of course, there is no way to know for certain, but we can make an educated guess by examining Nvidia's performance following past stock splits. History says Nvidia stock is headed for a sharp decline Nvidia has completed five stock splits since its IPO in 1999. Following those events, shares typically declined (often substantially) during the next 12 months and 24 months, as shown in the chart. Stock Split Date Stock Split Type Return (12 Months Later) Return (24 Months Later)  July 20, 20214-for-1(4%)145% Sept. 11, 20073-for-2(70%)(53%) April 7, 20062-for-11%(6%) Sept. 12, 20012-for-1(72%)(49%) June 27, 20002-for-128%(52%) Average\u00a0(23%)(3%)  Data source: YCharts. As shown, Nvidia stock declined by an average of 23% during the 12-month period following past stock splits, and the stock was still down by an average of 3% after 24 months. In other words, history says Nvidia is headed for a steep, prolonged drawdown. But there is a major asterisk by that statement: Four of the past five stocks splits occurred in close proximity to a recession. Specifically, the U.S. economy was in a recession from March 2001 through November 2001, and from December 2007 through June 2009. Those economic downturns precipitated bear markets that had devastating consequences for the stock market, so Nvidia was naturally dragged down. Importantly, while shares initially declined, investors have still done exceptionally well if they purchased shares when any of the previous stock splits took place. The chart provides details. Stock Split Date Stock Split Type Return (Since the Stock Split)  July 20, 20214-for-1527% Sept. 11, 20073-for-214,580% April 7, 20062-for-124,840% Sept. 12, 20012-for-140,100% June 27, 20002-for-142,650%  Data source: YCharts.   Story Continues Going forward, Nvidia's performance depends primarily on its ability to grow revenue and earnings, and investors have good reason to be bullish.Nvidia is the market leader in artificial intelligence chipsThe bull case for Nvidia builds on its critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the standard-bearer in accelerated computing, a discipline that pairs specialized hardware and software to speed up demanding data center workloads like AI applications. Indeed, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\"Dominance in the GPU market has allowed Nvidia to branch into adjacent data center product categories, including central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and cloud services. CEO Jensen Huang sees that evolution as a key competitive advantage. \"We literally build the entire data center,\" he told analysts. \"This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today.\"Nvidia has strung together a series of truly impressive financial reports, as shown in the chart. That trend continued in the first quarter. Revenue surged 262% to $26 billion on strong data center sales growth driven by demand for AI products. Meanwhile, gross margin expanded 12 percentage points, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income jumped 462% to $15.2 billion.  Nvidia has grown revenue and non-GAAP net income at a triple-digit pace for four consecutive quarters.  Going forward, Nvidia will inevitably lose momentum at some point, but the company will have a powerful tailwind at its back for years to come. Spending on artificial intelligence hardware, software, and services is projected to increase at 36.6% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.Somewhat surprisingly, Nvidia stock trades at a discount to its historical valuationSome investors may worry that Nvidia is overvalued, given that shares tripled over the past year. But earnings have actually grown more quickly. Remember, non-GAAP net income increased 462% in the first quarter. That means the price-to-earnings ratio has been falling.Moreover, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 38% annually over the next three to five years, and the stock currently trades at 70 times earnings. That gives a PEG ratio of 1.8, a significant discount to the three-year average of 3.2. In short, Nvidia shares are trading at a cheaper-than-average valuation despite the phenomenal price appreciation of the past year.I'll close with a quote from Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore: \"Bottom line, we think the backdrop warrants AI exposure even amid extreme enthusiasm -- and Nvidia remains the clearest way to get that exposure.\"Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

My estimate was that this high-flying semiconductor stock could almost double in value over a three-year period, but it exceeded those expectations by a massive margin.\n\nLet's see why that has been the case and check how much upside this high-flying chipmaker can deliver following the outstanding gains it has clocked in the past year.\nNvidia's growth has exceeded Wall Street's expectations by miles\nA year ago, analysts were expecting Nvidia to deliver $42.9 billion in revenue and $7.68 per share in earnings for fiscal 2024. Instead, the company ended the fiscal year with adjusted earnings of $12.96 per share on revenue of $60.9 billion. It is also worth noting that analysts were forecasting Nvidia to deliver revenue of $50.6 billion for fiscal 2025 followed by $62.7 billion in fiscal 2026.\nHowever, as the following chart indicates, analysts' expectations for Nvidia have simply rocketed in the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nThat's not surprising, as the chipmaker has been delivering better-than-expected growth quarter after quarter thanks to the massive demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. For instance, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28), Nvidia's revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion, and earnings increased 461% to $6.12 per share.\nSuch strong growth has led analysts to raise their growth expectations for the company further, as reflected in the previous chart. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says this terrific growth is here to stay as \"companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center -- AI factories -- to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence.\"\nInvestors should note that Nvidia is playing a pioneering role in the proliferation of AI with its hardware and software offerings. The company controlled a massive 94% of the market for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) last year, and it is witnessing little competition in this space despite the efforts of its rivals. With the global GPU market forecast to post annual growth of 31% through 2032 and generate $594 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, there is room for Nvidia to keep growing at a robust pace in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has other catalysts beyond the AI data center market. It is the leading provider of GPUs used in personal computers (PCs) as well with an estimated market share of 88%. This puts the company in a solid position to record healthy incremental growth in the future thanks to the lucrative opportunity present in the overall GPU market.\nHealthy earnings growth points toward more upside\nInvestors have already seen how fast Nvidia's top line is expected to grow over the next three fiscal years. The good part is that the revenue growth is set to filter down to the bottom line as well. Analysts are expecting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 43% for the next five years. Based on its fiscal 2024 earnings of $1.21 per share, Nvidia's bottom line could jump to $7.24 per share after five years.\nMultiplying the projected earnings after five years with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 29 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) points toward a stock price of $210. That would be a 78% jump from current levels.\nHowever, with the trillion-dollar end-market opportunity that the company is sitting on and the rapid pace at which its end-markets, such as AI chips, are growing, it won't be surprising to see this tech stock delivering stronger gains over the next five years and exceeding the $200 Street-high price target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

But there have been three times in the last five years where it's had a look forward price-earnings multiple of over 50X, and two times in the last five years where it's gotten just about to 70X, and then it pulled back. So we just haven't seen that euphoria yet.\"Jackson is betting that as investors start to focus on Nvidia's earnings potential in 2025 and 2026, euphoria could drive Nvidia well above its average forward P/E multiple and closer to its peak.\n\n\"This is a high flyer, and expectations can reset on a bad earnings report, but they can also get equally overhyped on good news. And despite the fact the stock has had this enormous run, the euphoria hasn't yet caught up in terms of the go-forward multiple,\" Jackson said.Shares of Nvidia have already soared 151% year to date, and the chipmaker was briefly the most valuable company in the world at its peak last week, with a market valuation of about $3.3 trillion.\"I think what's going to happen in the second half of this year, as people start to see how well the Blackwell chips are selling, how good the gross margins are on those, and start thinking about what's to come with the Rubin chips around the corner, I think we'll start to see that euphoria reflected in a lofty go-forward price-earnings multiple, and if that happens, this thing can go to $6 trillion market cap,\" Jackson said.\n\nJackson added that Nvidia had a sizable lead over its competition and would take advantage of that for years to come. Additionally, Jackson said that comparisons of Nvidia today to Cisco during the dot-com bubble were unfounded.\"This is not Cisco in the dot-com era. Back then, Cisco's go-forward P/E multiple got to a peak of something like 136X. Again, we're below the mean for the last five years. So even though the stock has done so well, it is still relatively cheap compared to where it was trading in the past,\" Jackson said.Jackson isn't the only one on Wall Street who is still bullish on the stock even when accounting for its massive run over the past year.\n\nConstellation Research and Rosenblatt have a $200 price target for Nvidia stock, while Bank of America recently reiterated its $150 target.While Nvidia's long-term prospects remain bullish, according to Wall Street, that does not mean it is immune from sharp declines.Shares of Nvidia wiped out more than $400 billion in market value earlier this week, with the stock staging a three-day correction of 16%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Specialist in global markets, economics and alternative investments.Follow AuthorJun 23, 2024, 04:06pm EDTShareSaveCommentAFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images\nNvidia shares dropped nearly 7% over a two-day span, sparking concerns that the meteoric rise of the artificial intelligence market leader's stock price may have peaked. Nvidia briefly surpassed Microsoft and Apple midweek to become the world's most valuable company but slipped back to third place by Friday's close. Investors are now debating whether to take profits on NVDA and the broader AI sector or stick with the theme that has driven most of this year's S&P 500 gains.\n\n\nFirst, the recent 7% dip should be taken into context. Nvidia shares are still up 156% year to date, and last week's dip is relatively minor and barely shows up on a long-term chart. Investors should expect dramatic and painful drawdowns from companies that have moved so far so fast. Nvidia is no exception. Its shares fell by 66% at one point in 2022 and have had four drawdowns of approximately 15% or more in the last year alone.\nNVDA stock priceGarth Friesen\n\nStill, several concerns are causing investors to reevaluate their faith in the Nvidia rally. Gaining the status as the world's most valuable company when the overall economy appears to be losing momentum is one obvious worry. The extreme domination of large-cap technology stocks at the index level is another. Also, the significant outperformance of AI-related stocks in the last month relative to the rest of the market has once again prompted talk of bubble-like price action. These concerns provide an opportunity to pause and look at Nvidia from a larger perspective. Is a bubble forming, or is the share price appreciation warranted?\n\nThere are some standard definitions of a stock or stock market bubble, primarily using history is a guide. Typical characteristics are rapid and substantial price increases that outpace reasonable valuations; widespread investor enthusiasm and speculation, often accompanied by a fear of missing out and speculative behavior; and a belief in new paradigms, technologies, or economic conditions that create excitement about future growth prospects.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nRapid And Substantial Price Appreciation\nNvidia and other AI stocks have rocketed higher in the last 18 months. Nvidia has soared nearly 800% since the start of 2023 and other tech giants like Meta (+297%), Amazon (+120%) and Microsoft (+88%) have done the same. However, the near-parabolic rise is not without fundamental support. Nvidia continues to exceed analysts' expectations of earnings and profit growth and boasts an estimated market share of 80% in specialized chips needed for most AI applications. The other technology leaders are also delivering earnings growth above what many thought possible.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 showed revenue growth of 262% compared to a year ago. Data center growth was even more impressive, climbing 427% from last year. With gross margins of 78%, profits are following suit. Clearly, there is more to Nvidia than pure speculation.\n\n 1-year forward P/E multiple for Nvidia and and Nasdaq 100Garth Friesen; Bloomberg LP\nFrom a valuation perspective, Nvidia is not cheap. According to Bloomberg data, NVDA\u2019s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio is 47x, compared to 35.9x for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, 29x for the NASDAQ 100 Index, 22.6x for the S&P 500, and 17.8x for the equal-weight S&P 500 Index. Yes, Nvidia is expensive relative to the broader market, but that is to be expected given the rapid growth in revenue and earnings. Investors are willing to pay up for growth, and Nvidia is delivering. Applying traditional valuation metrics to fast-growing companies in relatively new industries is often futile. But are the current multiples too extreme?\nBy comparison, during the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, Nasdaq 100 stocks traded at an absurd trailing P/E of 200, more than six times today's level. Cisco, a poster child of the dot-com era, was valued at a multiple of more than 150 times forward earnings when the stock hit its peak in March 2000. In this context, neither Nvidia nor the broader market are near the valuation levels seen during the internet bubble. However, Nvidia\u2019s recent earnings and sales multiple expansion suggests a disconnect between the share price and performance of the underlying business. AI stocks have spiked, and valuations have stretched, but at least some fundamental support is behind the craze.\nIf rating its rapid price appreciation bubble on a scale of 1 to 10, the score is likely a seven.\nWidespread Investor Enthusiasm And Speculation\nAnother potential sign of a bubble is extreme euphoria and speculation surrounding a stock or a theme.\nThe options market is one place to look for excessive sentiment. Stocks or sectors where call option volatility is trading higher than put option volatility is often a sign that investors expect significant upside from existing levels. Currently, 1-month and 3-month call options have roughly the same level of implied volatility as put options. This is consistent with market pricing over the last year. Call options were more expensive last March around the earnings report. Today, there does not appear to be extreme bullishness in the options market.\nStill, everyone is watching the AI boom. Public company mentions of AI in earnings calls are at a record high. Roughly 40% of S&P 500 discussed AI on their earnings calls this past quarter \u2014 up from 1% five years ago, according to data from FactSet. Most of these companies cite AI as a potential productivity booster rather than an additional source of revenue, and many are making substantial investments in the technology. There is widespread enthusiasm about AI, but it should not be considered speculation since productivity improvements have already been established.\nA potentially worrisome sign would be a rush of new companies tapping the public markets to raise money for anything related to AI, similar to the internet bubble where investors scrambled to buy anything with \".com\" in the name. According to Bloomberg, total initial public offerings are running at about $16 billion in proceeds raised year-to-date versus about $20 billion for all of 2023. In terms of deal count, there have been 88 IPOs through mid-June 2024, compared to 154 in 2023. The record was set in 2021 with 1035 IPOs. If there was an AI startup bubble, it peaked in 2021.\nIf rating the level of speculation in Nvidia to past bubbles on a scale of 1 to 10, the score is probably a six.\nBelief In New Paradigms\nAI is not the first technology to induce predictions of a materially altered future. Crypto was supposed to be the future of finance, and 3-D printing was expected to revolutionize manufacturing. Neither crypto nor 3-D printing has lived up to the initial hype. AI may fall into the same category, but there are reasons to believe it will indeed have a material impact on economics and society.\nBig technology firms and dozens of large corporations are making huge investments in the space. Hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into Nvidia's chips and AI-related infrastructure, such as data centers and the electrical grid. These investments are already paying off in direct AI revenue and enhanced productivity.\nAccording to a recent PwC report, AI is predicted to increase productivity, raise growth domestic product growth, contribute to scientific discovery, and improve the healthcare system. The study predicts AI has the potential to contribute 14%, or $15.7 trillion, to the global economy by 2030. These are lofty predictions and very well may materialize. However, the fact that these studies are becoming more prevalent indicates belief that a new paradigm has formed.\nA number of changing circumstances could quickly alter the impact of this new paradigm. Shifts in global trade policy, emerging new technologies and competitors, a markdown in global growth expectations, or geopolitical shocks are just a few examples. AI could have a significant impact on many aspects of society, but it is possible that the return on investment will fail to materialize. Regardless of the outcome, investors are betting on, and talking about, a \u201cnew future.\u201d\nWhen comparing the level of belief in a new paradigm to past bubbles on a scale of 1 to 10, the score would likely be an eight.\nNvidia Is Not In A Bubble But It Is Not Without Risk\nNvidia has become larger than the respective stock markets of Germany, France, and the U.K. Nvidia and other companies directly benefiting from AI are now at valuation levels that offer little room for error, and they must continue surpassing expectations and maintaining their market leadership to justify their current price.\nIs there a risk of another drawdown similar in magnitude to the ones we have witnessed over the last year? Absolutely. But is there a bubble-bursting crash in all AI-related stocks around the corner? Likely not. According to standard definitions of a bubble, Nvidia does not appear to be in the late stages of a one: valuations are high, but not at extreme levels; enthusiasm about AI is widespread, but not without fundamental support; and AI has already started to deliver on some of the lofty expectations in terms of new applications and overall productivity, validating predictions of a new paradigm.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

CEO Jensen Huang replied that the chipmaker is concentrating on data centers and seeking to find new markets for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. He added that the company\u2019s chips offer the \u201clowest total cost of ownership\u201d in the sector.\nNvidia Thinks It Can Stave Off Competitors\nHuang reported that Nvidia\u2019s current domination of the AI chip space is due to large, multi-billion-dollar investments that it has made in itself for over a decade. Moreover, the chipmaker, which used to concentrate on making graphics processors for video games and creatives, has \u201ctransformed\u201d itself into a data center-focused firm.\nMeanwhile, Huang asserted that the total cost of Nvidia\u2019s AI chips is cheaper than competing products despite their very high price tags. That\u2019s because they perform better than competing processors and cost less to maintain, the CEO stated.\nAlso importantly, Nvidia  is looking to identify new markets for its chips, including  industrial robots, and is seeking to form many alliances in order to accomplish that goal.\nMany (But Not All) on the Street Remain Upbeat on NVDA Stock\nKnox Ridley, a portfolio manager at Tech Insider Network, recently said that Nvidia would remain on top of the AI sector, just as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stayed ahead of its competitors in the smartphone sector. Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager at EMJ Capital, predicted that NVDA stock would finish the year at $250, giving it a truly staggering market capitalization of $6 trillion.\nHowever, as of yesterday afternoon, the chipmaker\u2019s market capitalization had sunk $429 billion in the preceding three days, Seeking Alpha reported. And insiders at the company have reportedly disposed of $700 million of its shares in 2024, Bloomberg noted on June 18.\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

CEO Jensen Huang intends to achieve vertically integrated domination from silicon to software through partnerships and direct routes to market. Unlike the PC age where Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco served as a triumvirate foundational players, this new era will have new players all tied back to Nvidia,\" Wang told Business Insider in an e-mail on Monday.\n\nThese are the seven reasons Wang expects Nvidia stock to soar 65% from current levels.1. Visionary founder-led CEO\"It's a visionary-led CEO, and that's very very important as you've seen in the valley. Those are the ones that have led, like the Larry Ellisons of the world, the scott Mcnealys, the Mark Zuckerbergs,\" Wang said.2. High barrier to entry\"There's few competitors that can come into this chip market, and it takes a long time to get a chip to market, and if you can do that and if you succeed and then if you can actually get the right chip, that's a very hard thing to do.\"\n\n3. High switching costs\"Once you're in, you're locked in because of the CUDA software and all the access to the chips, the software, and the entire stack. You're going to be locked in for quite some time and they've got quite a lead in terms of doing that.\"4. Dominant market share\"Nvidia has had dominant market share, and I think that makes a big difference because they've been in this market for quite some time and the competitors are behind by 24 months.\"5. Strong product roadmap\"We're only seeing one-tenth, maybe one-one hundredth of the product roadmap that Nvidia has out there, and that's really exciting for those who actually have some insight into what they have next, because it's more than just chips, and it's more than just what's happening in software. That ability to go from silicon all the way to the end side, that's where we're going to see a lot of the innovation.\"\n\n6. GPU is the default standard in AI\"The ecosystem has made the GPU a default standard. It's the standard everyone's looking to for AI from inference and testing.\"7. The numbers don't lie\"We're seeing some amazing growth here that actually matches the P/E ratio, and that's what everyone is looking at, they're trying to figure out how this is going to continue, but gross margins are 78%, 262% growth compared to a year ago, this is going to continue for at least the next 18 to 24 months.\"Wang said the current 14% decline in the stock since it peaked at about $140 per share last week represents yet another buying opportunity for investors.\n\n\"The pullback is coming at a macro level. People are worried about the consumer side, people worried about where the economy is going to head, and they're doing some profit-taking before the summer, so I think it's a good time to buy the dip,\" Wang said.Wang isn't the only analyst on Wall Street with a $200 price target for Nvidia stock.Last week, Rosenblatt raised its Nvidia price target to $200 per share on the prospect of the company better monetizing its CUDA software platform. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

With NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, developers can test sensor perception and associated AI software at scale in physically accurate, realistic virtual environments before real-world deployment \u2014 enhancing safety while saving time and costs.\n\u201cDeveloping safe and reliable autonomous machines powered by generative physical AI requires training and testing in physically based virtual worlds,\u201d said Rev Lebaredian, vice president of Omniverse and simulation technology at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices will enable developers to easily build large-scale digital twins of factories, cities and even Earth \u2014 helping accelerate the next wave of AI.\u201d\nSupercharging Simulation at Scale\r\nBuilt on the OpenUSD framework and powered by NVIDIA RTX\u2122 ray-tracing and neural-rendering technologies, Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX accelerates the creation of simulated environments by combining real-world data from videos, cameras, radar and lidar with synthetic data.\nEven for scenarios with limited real-world data, the microservices can be used to simulate a broad range of activities, such as whether a robotic arm is operating correctly, an airport luggage carousel is functional, a tree branch is blocking a roadway, a factory conveyor belt is in motion, or a robot or person is nearby.\nResearch Wins Drive Real-World Deployment\r\nThe Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX announcement comes at the same time as NVIDIA\u2019s first-place win at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference\u2019s Autonomous Grand Challenge for End-to-End Driving at Scale.\nNVIDIA researchers\u2019 winning workflow can be replicated in high-fidelity simulated environments with Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX \u2014 giving autonomous vehicle (AV) simulation developers the ability to test self-driving scenarios in physically accurate environments before deploying AVs in the real world.\nEcosystem Access and Availability \nForetellix and MathWorks are among the first software developers to which NVIDIA is providing Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX access for AV development.\nOmniverse Cloud Sensor RTX will also enable sensor manufacturers to validate and integrate digital twins of their sensors in virtual environments, reducing the time needed for physical prototyping.\nSign up for early access to Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, which will be available later this year.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to :the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX and NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and neural rendering technologies; third parties using or adopting our products or technologies; NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX\u00a0microservices\u00a0enabling developers to easily develop large-scale digital twins for factories, cities and even the Earth \u2014 helping accelerate the next wave of AI are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

Ramish Cheema   June 29, 2024 9 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.15%          We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other growth stocks. Ray Dalio is one of the most successful investors in Wall Street's history. He has invested through his firm Bridgewater Associates, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Bridgewater had a 13F portfolio worth $19.7 billion as of Q1 2024 end. What's more, is that we also looked at the top hedge funds on Wall Street as part of our coverage of 23 Best Hedge Funds of All Time and discovered that Bridgewater Associates ranked in the top five due to its $30 billion in gains since inception.  Looking at these, it's clear that Dalio and his firm must be doing at least something right. Ray Dalio is a macro player who not only loves to look at the broader trends that affect the economy, but he also loves diversification and selling stocks at the right time. This approach differs from several other hedge funds which choose to focus on specific companies or are proponents of buying and holding stocks for the long term. Dalio's strategy allows his fund to manage a changing economic and investment climate, as part of what is dubbed an All Weather Strategy. However, despite his success, 2024 has been a mixed year for Bridgewater Associates. The firm, currently headed by CEO Nir Bar Dea, is currently shaking things up as its Pure Alpha fund has lost 4% for the last four years. This fund also had one of its worst years in history in 2023, but the changes do appear to be making their mark. This is because in Q1, the fund posted 16% in returns which were higher than the 4.59% in gains made by global hedge funds.  As for Dalio, even though he has moved forward from directly overseeing Bridgewater's affairs, the investment guru regularly shares his wisdom with the world. He started 2024 by listing five key forces that will play a dominant theme in the investment environment this year. In a LinkedIn post, the billionaire shared that these forces are those that determine how the economy, the American and global political systems, forces of nature, and humanity's innovation work. While these forces are important for 2024, Dalio's life's work has focused on studying them over the course of the years and analyzing how they match similar trends in history. This makes his investment approach one of the most unique ones in the industry, and it appears to be yielding results as between 1991 and 2022, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund has delivered 11.4% in average annual returns.   Story Continues Dalio is also one of the few investors in the world who takes a serious approach to studying history and understanding the implications on the broader investing environment. Ever eager to share his insights, the famed investor gave a talk at Columbia Business School in April. Commenting on the investment approach at Bridgewater, the billionaire shared his values, philosophy, and guiding beacons for the process. He started out by sharing that he began his career by trading commodities because they had low margin requirements which would let him make more money. The stock market crash of 1982, which forced Dalio to borrow $4,000 from his father to pay bills was also critical in formulating his investment approach. As we've mentioned above, diversification is a key theme of Dalio's All Weather Strategy, and the market crash influenced this approach:And the way I looked at the risk, is I said, it's like I, I, had a visual image that there's this jungle there. And if I can cross the jungle without getting killed to the other side I would be okay. But I have to go through that, and then, or I could stay on the safe life side. And not take those risks. And how would I do that? And that was a problem that I had to figure out. And I realized two things I needed to do. I needed to diversify because it's like my 15 uncorrelated returns stream mantra. I've realized that if I can have debts, 15 good uncorrelated return streams that I could reduce my risk by 80% with keeping the same expected returns. Finally, before we get to Ray Dalio's top growth stock picks, it's also important to understand why such stocks are important particularly in today's investment environment. US economic growth slowed down to 1.6% in Q1 from 2.4% in Q4 2023. At the same time, while the stock market has flourished on the AI front, other sectors have shown that persistently high inflation and tight credit conditions are making their mark. Since the economy is the sum product goods and services produced, firms whose revenue growth outpaces the consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 3.3% for May and the GDP growth are adding more customers to their top line instead of simply matching economic trends. Combining such stocks with the investment principles of the legendary Ray Dalio can help gain a better understanding of some of the market's top sectors.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top growth stocks that Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates have invested in.Our MethodologyTo make our list of Ray Dalio's top growth stocks, we analyzed Bridgewater Associate's 13F filings for Q1 2024 and picked out ten stocks with strong fiscal year annual revenue growth among the top 80 stocks.  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Latest Fiscal Year Annual Growth Rate: 125.85%Bridgewater Associates' Q1 2024 Investment: $636 millionNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is unsurprisingly the top revenue growth stock in Ray Dalio's portfolio. The firm's fortunes have soared due to the strong demand for its AI GPUs, which are industry leading when it comes to performance. One particular competitive advantage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs is the CUDA platform. CUDA is the firm's proprietary software which enables users to use the chips for AI and other associated workloads. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also benefits from close ties to its customers, through which it guides them on the most efficient ways in which to use its products. CUDA sets it apart from products from smaller rival AMD, and it has allowed it to target some of the biggest firms in the world with its products.However, the fact that its products are pricey and that its biggest customers have adequate resources to develop their own AI chips means that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is constantly in a rush to launch the latest products and prove its mettle. Big ticket firms the likes of Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Facebook parent Meta have all designed and used their custom chips or are designing their own chips, even for AI workloads. This makes the future quite interesting for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Baron Funds, whose largest investment position was in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of Q1 2024 end, was cognizant of the firm's innovational lead when it comes to the well known S Curve. Here is what the fund said in its Q1 2024 investor letter:We are early on the adoption S-curve \u2013 most companies are still in the proof of concept stage while very few are ready for production today. Hurdles in implementing AI include data prep, model adaptation and fine-tuning, and embedding of AI into existing workflows. There is a lot of innovation taking place to reducing these hurdles \u2013 from tools and infrastructure that help companies build and run AI models more easily, to third-party AI models exposed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable companies to use them without building their own models from scratch. NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem across developers, system integrators, cloud providers and independent software vendors, and internal software innovation are lowering these hurdles as well. For example, one of the most interesting announcements at the GTC conference were NVIDIA Inference Microservices \u2013 or NIMs, which are APIs to easily access open-source models (NVIDIA already has dozens of models available) without the need to worry about model optimizations, security, patching, or sending data to third parties. NIMs could ease AI adoption for enterprises while also driving incremental monetization for NVIDIA, priced at $4,500/GPU or at $1/GPU hour if used on the cloud, and increase the stickiness of NVIDIA\u2019s platform. Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. You can visit 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio to see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Now, with an announcement that the firm is raising its dividend so much, is it not also a heavyweight in this investing realm? Not so fast.\nNvidia's yield before its announcement was a teensy 0.02%, and it now stands at 0.03%, based on an annual payout of 4 cents per share. (The company also announced\u00a0a 10-for-1 stock split\u00a0effective June 7.) Even a tenfold increase in the company's previous dividend rate would still yield less than\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0(GOOGL)\u00a0or\u00a0Meta Platforms\u00a0(META), which both initiated dividends earlier this year. With the new rate effective with the dividend paid June 28, Nvidia\u2019s yield will still round down to 0.0% unless expressed using two decimal places.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\n\u2022\u00a0Fair Value Estimate: $1,050.00;\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Rating: 3 stars;\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide;\u2022\u00a0Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High.\nAt one time, Nvidia provided a thoroughly respectable yield. When the company initiated a dividend in late 2012, its stock yielded north of 2%, well above the broader US stock market and the average yields of its technology peers.\nWhile Nvidia provided modest dividend increases, those raises weren't enough to keep pace with the stock's share price. The forward yield equation is simple: divide the total dividends paid over the next 12 months by the current stock price. In the case of Nvidia, the immense growth of the denominator of this equation was enough to push the yield down from more than 2% to a couple hundredths of a percent.\nLooking ahead, Nvidia's yield will probably remain minuscule, barring a major change in management's approach to capital allocation. This means dividend income shouldn't be a factor when evaluating the investment case for owning the stock. As Morningstar equity strategist\u00a0Brian Colello\u00a0notes in\u00a0his analysis, the \"dividend is virtually immaterial relative to its financial health and forward prospects, and most of the firm\u2019s distribution to shareholders comes in the form of stock buybacks.\" Morningstar analysts do not forecast any additional dividend increases from Nvidia before 2030.\nDavid Harrell is editorial director for Morningstar Investment Management\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Nvidia Will be The Biggest Company in The World'\nWatch The Video Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nEQUITY MARKETS\nEQUITY RESEARCH\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate. For information on the historical Morningstar Medalist Rating for any managed investment Morningstar covers, please contact your local Morningstar office.For more detailed information about conflicts of interest, including EU MAR disclosures, please see the \u201cMorningstar Medalist Rating Analyst Conflict of Interest & Other Disclosures for EMEA\u201dhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                Ads help us provide you with high quality content at no cost to you.

The latest strong endorsement comes from Evercore ISI, which raised its price target to $145, implying more than 20% upside. Ultimately, Evercore believes that NVDA stock may end up representing 15% of the S&P 500.\nThat\u2019s a lofty goal considering that, presently, the second and third largest companies in the U.S. account for 13% of the index\u2019s total market capitalization, according to MarketWatch. However, it\u2019s quite possible that the 10-for-1 split of NVDA stock could spark even more upside for the firm.\nAccording to Evercore strategist Julian Emanuel, \u201cThe history of other \u2018marquee\u2019 tech stock splits has been \u2018rally first\u2019 then selloff/volatility after the split; such volatility resets the generational buying opportunity, time after time.\u201d\nCiting other companies that benefited from technological revolutions such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), it\u2019s possible for the NVDA stock split to coral more bullish enthusiasm and not just because of the enhanced access among retail investors. Rather, Nvidia \u2014 like Amazon \u2014 may fundamentally change the way business is run in its core industry.\nThe Bulls Make a Compelling Case for NVDA Stock\nAnalyst Mark Lipacis, who moved from Jefferies to Evercore, just made a big splash for the new employer with his take on NVDA:\n\n\u201cHistory suggests NVDA could become 10-15% of S&P 500 [\u2026] We have observed that at each successive computing era, the ecosystem players represent a larger weighting of the S&P 500.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s high praise for NVDA stock, and it\u2019s not without merit. According to CNBC, following its more than 200% surge in the past 52 weeks, the company\u2019s present weighting in the benchmark index has expanded to 6.6%, citing FactSet data. Still, it must be said that Nvidia has tough competition. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds a 7% weighting and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holds 6.4%.\nUltimately, Lipacis remains confident in NVDA stock, telling clients to continue bidding up shares ahead of this anticipated weighting expansion. Given this projection, the argument is that NVDA stock is technically undervalued.\nThat too may be a tough pill to swallow. However, part of the bullish argument is that several years ago, Nvidia focused on the gaming industry. Per Statista, total sales of that sector grew from $7.98 billion in 2000 to $19.7 billion in 2009, translating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 10%.\nToday, the focus is on artificial intelligence (AI). Per Grand View Research, this sector could generate revenue of over $1.81 trillion by 2030, translating to a CAGR of 36.6%.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This is because this security in the Semiconductor-General space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective. This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Semiconductor-General space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 73 out of 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there. Meanwhile, NVIDIA is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm\u2019s prospects in both the short and long term. NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus   NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus   NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from 58 cents per share to 63 cents per share, while current year estimates have risen from $2.44 per share to $2.68 per share.

You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider NVIDIA.

A flurry of upgrades continues to propel the stock higher (or chase the stock, depending on the analyst), but one key upgrade today is turning heads. Rosenblatt Securities just raised its price target to a Street high $200 per share, signaling NVDA stock could have much more room to run.\nWith shares of NVDA stock surging to nearly $135 per share in today\u2019s session, the high-performance chipmaker briefly became the world\u2019s largest company. That\u2019s an incredible move and one that\u2019s worthy of consideration.\nBut a $200 per share price target implies there\u2019s plenty of upside left. At $200 per share, Nvidia would be valued at nearly $5 billion. Let\u2019s dive into this call, what\u2019s driving it, and what investors may want to make of this projection.\nNVDA Stock Surges as Analysts Grow Increasingly Bullish\nAny sort of price target raised to a level that\u2019s roughly 50% above where a given stock is trading is notable. This upgrade appears connected to some of the chipmaker\u2019s most notable and obvious catalysts. Rosenblatt\u2019s upgrade sees Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell, Rubin and Hopper series chips driving more market share in the high-computing market. This is the high-margin area of the market Nvidia has pursued and is one most investors are watching closely.\nIf the company is successful in growing its market share, as analysts believe, it\u2019s possible that $5 in earnings per share could be possible by the end of 2026. At a $200 price target, this would value the company at roughly 40 times earnings, or roughly half its current trailing multiple.\nOf course, plenty needs to go right for these projections to hold. And it\u2019s unclear whether the artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds supporting Nvidia\u2019s recent outperformance are sustainable and how much demand has been pulled forward.\nBut for now, there\u2019s a reason so many analysts are jumping to one side of this ship. NVDA is a stock that the market just wants more of. Until that changes, it appears the party is on for this top chipmaker.\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Stock splits are fairly common, and they enable the company to reduce the price of the stock by a certain multiple, and offer more shares at an equivalent multiple. When a stock split takes place, it creates a more liquid market, and more market participants can now trade and invest in the newly lowered stock price.Why did NVDA stock split?Nvidia (NVDA) had a 10-1 stock split on June after closing at $1208.80, and on June 10 the stock price opened 10 times smaller than the previous close at $120.37. Stock and options positions realized a 10x increase in quantity at an adjusted cost basis, ultimately resulting in a non-event outside of the transaction itself. Nvidia likely split after the massive surge in the stock price the company realized over the past few years. Stock splits are usually seen as a positive from a growth perspective, as more market participants can now trade at the lower price than the previous high price of the stock.Nvidia is widely viewed as a staple in AI and tech, and with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like XLK rebalancing for more exposure in NVDA, all signs point to a currently bullish sentiment for Nvidia.What do stock splits mean for traders?When a split lowers a stock\u2019s prices, options prices decrease in similar fashion. Reduced options prices mean more-narrow bid-ask spreads and heightened activity, which means more-liquid markets overall.For options traders, this means getting in and out of strategies in a quicker and more clear way from a mid-price standpoint. This also means traders have more flexibility from a strategy standpoint. Small and mid-sized accounts can now participate in strategies that were reserved for large accounts when Nvidia was a $1,300 stock. Now at a $130 price point, traders can consider a much more diverse suite of strategies.On top of this, defined risk strategies are now relatively \"wider\" than the previous price point. For example, a 10-point wide iron condor in NVDA stock when it was $1,300 is relatively narrow. Now, a 10-point wide iron condor in NVDA stock at a price of $130 is pretty wide. This means a higher probability of profit all else equal, and a faster moving trade with a heightened exposure to the greeks.What's next for NVDA?Nvidia has significant call skew in the July options cycle, which implies that the velocity of risk is currently priced on the upside. This doesn't mean the stock is going to the upside for sure, it just tells us that the implied velocity risk is to the upside.We can always look to the options market to see what implied volatility is for the next few months. This tells us what the market is expecting in terms of stock price movement. Through the mid-August options cycle, we're looking at an implied stock price move of +-$19.78, which is well over 10% of the current stock price.Looking forward to the end of the year, we can see an expected stock price move of +-$38.26, which is well over 20% of the current stock price.This tells us that the market is still expecting a lot of realized volatility in Nvidia, and that should surprise no one given the historic rise in market cap the company has seen over the past year.Click here to watch Mike Butler explain it all.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 67% to be precise, is institutions.  Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).  And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$212b in market cap last week.  The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 204%.     Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NVIDIA, beginning with the chart below.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA NasdaqGS:NVDA Ownership Breakdown June 14th 2024 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.   NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company.  This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.  When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NVIDIA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth June 14th 2024  Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.    NVIDIA is not owned by hedge funds.      The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.7% of shares outstanding.       For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.4% by the third-largest shareholder.      Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares.     Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.   Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments.   There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  Insider Ownership Of NVIDIA The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least.  The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.  Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.   Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation.   Insiders own US$126b worth of shares (at current prices).  we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling.   General Public Ownership With a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA.  While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.   Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors.    Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with NVIDIA , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Attiya Zainib   June 17, 2024 5 min read           In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.18%          We recently published a list of the 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) ranks 2nd in the list, it deserves a deeper look. When the AI revolution began with the launch of ChatGPT, no one would have thought that down the road it would bring a huge growth catalyst for the PC industry, notorious for its cyclical nature and unpredictability. Fast forward to today, everyone is talking about PCs equipped with AI-focused equipment capable to process generative AI workloads. But in just a matter of few months why did the market feel the need for AI PCs? It all boils down to costs. GPT-4 costs $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for prompts and $0.06 for completion according to Microsoft\u2019s estimates. Consider millions of users prompting LLMs from their phones and computers. The costs of scaling such systems are not feasible. That\u2019s why the market thought allowing users to process AI-intensive workloads natively instead of using the Cloud is the future. And that caused the AI PC boom. Tech market analyst firm Canalys says AI PC shipments are expected to soar to 170 million in 2027, from 25 million in 2022. That would be a 60% share of the total PC market. The firm also expects AI PC shipments to double from 2023 to 2024 and double gain from 2024 to 2025.  Canalys also expects vendors to ship 205 million AI-capable PCs in 2028, representing a CAGR of 44% from 2024 through 2028. For this article we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 919 hedge funds and picked 8 AI PC stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Is NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) the Best AI PC Stock to Buy Now?   NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0is a no-brainer name when it comes to the best AI PC stocks, thanks to NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0wide range of chips it\u2019s providing to power AI workstations and laptops. NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0is specifically targeting the AI PC market with NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0GeForce RTX\u2122 GPUs and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:NVDA)\u00a0recently teased RTX AI laptops at Computex 2024.  While NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) is one of the best AI PC stocks based on hedge fund sentiment, many circles have voiced concerns over NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:NVDA) valuation and whether the stock would be able to continue on its growth trajectory. NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) expects $28.0 billion in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which was a sharp decline in growth rate according to many. Analysts also believe competitive threats to NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) are growing. AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors are powering many AI PCs developed by partners which include Microsoft. \u00a0Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently praised AMD and said his company was \u201cexcited\u201d to partner with AMD to deliver these new Ryzen AI powered Copilot+ PCs. Microsoft will be using MI300X Accelerators to power Azure\u2019s OpenAI workloads. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:NVDA) long-term growth of its Blackwell chips is also under threat from Chinese competitors like Huawei.   Story Continues While NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) is still one of the top AI picks of hedge funds and Wall Street, there are some lesser known AI stocks with long-term growth potential and low valuations. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NYSE:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Though NVDA stock is no longer the world\u2019s largest company after its latest correction, bringing the market cap to $3 trillion flat, I still think it\u2019s a bad idea to think the firm can\u2019t continue its growth just because of its behemoth size.  Indeed, a firm\u2019s sheer size alone doesn\u2019t seem to act as a limitation on growth, especially for firms, like Nvidia, which seems to have pulled so far ahead of the pack on AI. Further, in the artificial intelligence (AI) age, where data is a precious commodity, perhaps the size of a firm is fuel for further growth. The S&P 500 is already top-heavy. But it could become a lot top-heavier as the AI boom continues. NVDA stock is expected to keep experiencing intense volatility. For those who want to dampen the choppiness, perhaps an Nvidia-exposed ETF is worth consideration. Let\u2019s examine three that are heavy on NVDA shares. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)   close-up of the phrase \"exchange traded fund\" on three colorful papers pinned to a wall by colorful pushpins   Source: shutterstock.com/bangoland Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is perhaps the most interesting tech ETF to watch following the big rebalancing of its top holdings. Indeed, ETF rebalancing acts tend to be less of a big deal. However, the XLK is even top-heavier than the Nasdaq 100. And it\u2019s extremely concentrated in its top two holdings, with other individual holdings (including the third largest) typically contributing 5% or less. Today, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia each contribute over 20% of the XLK ETF\u2019s holdings. Indeed, having more than 40% in just two stocks takes portfolio concentration to another level.  Though cranking up the Nvidia exposure at the expense of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2014which now has a 4.5% weighting in the XLK, down from over 20%\u2014may prove ill-timed. If NVDA stock\u2019s correction continues while AAPL stock gains on Apple Intelligence, I do think XLK is giving investors what they want. The crowds want more Nvidia, and they\u2019re getting to go with a huge serving of Microsoft shares with the XLK. VanEck Robotics ETF (IBOT)   a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon   Source: shutterstock.com/sdecoret The VanEck Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:IBOT) is another Nvidia-heavy ETF. Further, NVDA stock boasts a sizable but not colossal weight, typically lying in the single-digit percentages. Indeed, if you like Nvidia but don\u2019t want it to be too much of a needle mover on an ETF, IBOT may be more your thing. Additionally, investors gain exposure to interesting semiconductor equipment makers that could greatly benefit from automation robotics in manufacturing. More intriguingly, many of the names are lesser-known international firms striving to unlock the benefits of AI and automation in the physical world.   Story Continues All considered, the IBOT ETF looks like a diversified way to play robotics companies that extend well beyond Nvidia. The greater diversification relative to the XLK is a major plus for new investors who want to steer away from overconcentration risk rather than towards it for a shot at bigger gains.VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)  Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.  Source: ShutterstockVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) is a popular ETF to get a quick gauge of the health of the broader semiconductor market. As you\u2019d expect, SMH shares have been smoking hot of late, up more than 53% year-to-date (YTD).Like NVDA stock, the SMH has been a bit wobbly this month, pulling back around 6.5% from all-time highs. The dip is likely nothing to worry about given the hot semi plays probably still have years of growth ahead of them.Despite broad exposure to 26 holdings, the SMH, like the XLK, is heavy on Nvidia, with the stock comprising more than 20% of the ETF. However, unlike the XLK, Nvidia is the only firm to boast a weight of more than 20%. In the second spot, it\u2019s Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), with a 12.9% weight.Indeed, SMH and XLK both look incredibly enticing if you want a passive way to play Nvidia and its peers. Depending on which angle you want to play tech, both ETFs stand out as intriguing.On the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Microsoft.

Shaun Pruitt   June 11, 2024 2 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            Trading just over $120 a share, Nvidia\u2019s NVDA\u00a010-1 stock split went into effect today making shares more accessible to a broader range of investors. This comes as the chip giant\u2019s stock price tripled in 2023 and had already more than doubled this year. Although stock splits don\u2019t change a company\u2019s overall market value, the lowered share price certainly prompts the discussion of if it's time to buy NVDA after previously trading near all-time highs of over $1,000.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Market Value Nvidia\u2019s dominance as the leader in semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence had recently led to its market capatilization surpassing Apple AAPL\u00a0at over $3 trillion to be the second highest-valued company in the United States behind Microsoft MSFT.  Indicative of Nvidia\u2019s dominance, this towers over other noteworthy chip leaders in AMD AMD\u00a0and Intel INTC\u00a0which have market caps of $271 billion and $130 billion respectively.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Post-Split Growth Trajectory Certainly, Nvidia\u2019s market\u00a0cap\u00a0and industry leadership make the case for investing in its stock and It's noteworthy that stock splits have no bearing on a company\u2019s underlying fundamentals or\u00a0earnings although earnings per share (EPS) are diluted to reflect the increased number of shares.  In this regard, Nvidia\u2019s annual earnings are now forecasted at $2.65 per share ($26.54 per share/10) for its current fiscal 2025 with FY26 EPS projected to expand 22% to $3.25. Of course, sales are not affected by a stock split either and Nvidia's top line is expected to soar 91% in FY25 to $116.4 billion versus $60.92 billion in FY24. Better still, FY26 sales are projected to climb another 22% to $142.29 billion.   Zacks Investment Research   Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Takeaway\u00a0 Optimistically, Nvidia\u2019s stock split does look like an opportunity to get in on the tech\u00a0behemoth's\u00a0expansive growth at a more reasonable price with NVDA boasting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The forward stock split also comes at an ideal time for investors as Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell series of GPUs are expected to officially launch later in the year and are thought to be the most powerful AI chips on the market ahead of its current H200 series and AMD\u2019s MI300 series.

It surpassed Apple to become the world\u2019s second-highest-valued company. I also predicted that NVDA could go for a stock split, and it just did. The stock continues to surprise with newer highs (+144% YTD) after its spectacular earnings beat. Nonetheless, my thesis remains intact: NVDA is attractive for the long term based on its undeniable AI leadership and exponential AI growth potential. NVDA Reports Blowout Earnings Over and Over Again On May 22, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q1 result, driven by robust continued computing and accelerated generative AI demand momentum.\u00a0Adjusted earnings of $6.12 per share\u00a0handily beat the consensus estimate of $5.60 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+461%) than the Fiscal Q1-2024 (ended April 2023) figure of $1.09 per share.  Impressively, Q1 revenue jumped 262% year-over-year to $26.04 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $24.59 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 13.8 percentage points to an unbelievably new high at 78.4% from 64.6% a year ago. Concurrent with the earnings report, the company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While the stock split does not change the valuation or the performance of the company, it does mean that NVDA will now be more available to retail investors, creating short-term momentum in the share price. On top of that, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. NVDA shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis today. Markedly, this is Nvidia\u2019s sixth stock split. Importantly, NVDA\u2019s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. The segment makes up 86% of the firm\u2019s total revenue. As expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that \u201cbusiness in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past.\u201d  Looking ahead, the Q2 guidance appears promising, with its revenues expected to hover around $28 billion, ahead of expectations. However, adjusted gross margins are forecast to be around 75.5% versus 77% projected for Q1 three months ago. Nonetheless, it still remains far ahead of chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with gross profit margins of 50.6% and 41.5%, respectively, in the past year. NVDA Continues to Innovate and Retains Its Top-Notch AI Leadership Status Nvidia continues to innovate in the AI\u00a0space, keeping its leadership status quo intact by innovating newer, cutting-edge AI products. NVDA\u2019s latest GPUs & CPUs, backed by both its hardware and software capabilities, remain top-of-the-line in the AI industry.\u00a0As the preferred choice in high-computing data centers worldwide, NVDA commands superior pricing power.   Story Continues The scope and expansion of AI continue to grow manifold, and the demand clearly continues to outpace supply. During the earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, \u201cBeyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\u201dAt the Computex conference held in Taiwan on June 2, Huang unveiled Nvidia\u2019s latest AI architecture, Rubin, which is expected to begin shipping in 2026. This follows the launch of the Blackwell platform less than three months ago in March. Blackwell, designed for high-performance AI and scientific computing, succeeded the Hopper platform, which was optimized for AI inference and training and launched less than a year ago.Blackwell is now in full production and expected to ramp up in Q3. Meanwhile, Hopper continues to see strong demand.Further, Huang said that NVDA will launch a new family of chips every year, compared to its initial plan of releasing new models every two years. This accelerated pace of innovation and rapid transition to newer models and chip enhancements has allowed Nvidia to retain a 70% to 95% market share (according to estimates from Mizuho Securities) in the AI chip market.However, competition in the AI space is heating up. Competitors like AMD (with its Ryzen AI 300) and\u00a0Intel are launching newer AI chips at lower prices. Despite this, Nvidia\u2019s first-mover advantage in AI technology keeps AMD and Intel several quarters behind NVDA.NVDA Valuation Still Isn\u2019t Expensive, Given Its Earnings ProwessHaving overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.On the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive. Currently, it\u2019s trading at a forward P/E ratio of 44.7x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, NVDA\u2019s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, AMD, is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8x,\u00a0while Netherlands-based semiconductor stock\u00a0ASML (NASDAQ:ASML)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 51x.Interestingly, its current valuation is still hovering around its five-year average of 46.6x despite the earnings, margins, and stock price having grown multifold. These are attractive price levels and likely present a reasonable buying opportunity, in my view, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan Nvidia.Is NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?NVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 37 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the\u00a0average Nvidia stock target price of $123.62\u00a0suggests that the shares will return 2.2% over the next year.  Conclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI PotentialNvidia has climbed to become the second most valuable stock in the world, with a market cap of $2.98 trillion, a significant leap from just under $100 billion less than five years ago. NVDA has earned its stature by leading the AI industry to unprecedented heights.Despite increasing competition, NVDA continues to enjoy a\u00a0sizeable market share in the AI industry, which will continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years.\u00a0Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels. While some critics warn of waning demand after the initial wave of AI installations, I believe this is at least several quarters away. Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Attiya Zainib   June 28, 2024 5 min read        2   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.24%          We recently published a list of the\u00a0Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. The second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.  For this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 186 Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares have an RSI of over 70, indicating the stock is overbought. It\u2019s the second-biggest holding of the QQQ ETF, which has entered the overbought territory according to BTIG. However, many believe NVDA has more upside potential. UBS believes Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from the $331 billion market opportunity in the AI Enabling layer, thanks to its GPUs. In the Cloud segment of the Enabling layer, UBS thinks Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX offering makes the company a promising player. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) DGX Cloud is a supercomputing service that gives enterprises access to software and infrastructure required to train advanced models for generative AI. It\u2019s a combination of servers and workstations for optimizing deep learning applications through the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU).   Story Continues On the Intelligence and Application layer of the AI value chain, UBS sees no notable catalyst for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\u201cNVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our top contributor in the quarter following blowout 4Q results and 1Q guidance driven by strong data center sales. The company reported quarterly revenue of $22.1 billion, up 265% year-over-year, and EPS in the quarter of $5.16, up 487% year-over-year and 12% ahead of expectations. Revenue guidance for 1Q of $24 billion was 8% above very high expectations. The artificial intelligence arms race kicked-off by ChatGPT and Alphabet\u2019s Bard, among others, has generated tremendous demand for Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphic processors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

It\u2019s a stunning development because chasing the stock higher has been a profitable strategy for a long. Yet, some stock traders will learn that Nvidia isn\u2019t invincible. Sure, it\u2019s still a highly profitable company, but I am neutral on NVDA stock until the share price pulls back more.  Nvidia designs powerful processors that can be used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company is a darling of the stock market, and as we\u2019ll discuss soon, analysts are generally enamored with Nvidia. Yet, there\u2019s actually a Wall Street expert who dares to assign a negative rating to Nvidia stock (we\u2019ll get to that topic in a moment). I won\u2019t go full-on bearish, as I\u2019m neutral and only want to see Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization and valuation come down somewhat. To me, it\u2019s a case of \u201cright company, right stock, wrong price.\u201d Nvidia Could Conquer Another Region of the World In case Nvidia wasn\u2019t already world-dominating, the company is reportedly making a big move in the Middle East soon. There, Nvidia has agreed to deploy its AI technology in data centers owned by Qatar-based telecom firm Ooredoo. More specifically, Ooredoo\u2019s data centers in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives will have access to robust AI and graphics-processing technology, courtesy of Nvidia. Currently, the financial details of the Nvidia-Ooredoo agreement are unknown. This agreement comes at a politically contentious time, to say the least. The U.S. government might not be too happy about the Nvidia-Ooredoo deal due to concerns that Middle Eastern countries could potentially provide an avenue for China to get high-powered AI processors.  The U.S. can place restrictions on its exports of sophisticated AI chips to China, but it can\u2019t control what every company does in every country. So, it will be interesting to see if there are any repercussions from the arrangement between Nvidia and Ooredoo. For the time being, though, it\u2019s probably reasonable to conclude that Nvidia will plant its proverbial flag in the Middle East and thereby gain access to new revenue streams. A Dissenting Voice on Nvidia Stock To be fair and balanced, I started off with a piece of good news for Nvidia\u2019s shareholders. However, not everyone is straight-up bullish about Nvidia stock. There\u2019s a true contrarian voice out there on Wall Street, as investor and blogger Johnny Zhang actually went so far as to assign NVDA shares a Strong Sell rating.   Story Continues Is it even legal to do this in 2024? Zhang may be guilty of stock-market blasphemy, as Nvidia is viewed as an unassailable and invulnerable juggernaut of the white-hot AI hardware market.On the other hand, I tend to concur with Zhang\u2019s reasons for leaning bearish on Nvidia stock. The market\u2019s expectations about Nvidia\u2019s future growth may be \u201coverly optimistic, with potential risks including pull-forward demand, competition, and geopolitical tensions,\u201d Zhang explained.Nvidia doesn\u2019t currently have much \u201ccompetition\u201d in the niche market for AI-compatible graphics processing units (GPUs), but it\u2019s hard for one company to be the king of the hill. In such a lucrative industry, it shouldn\u2019t be too surprising if rival upstarts come out of the woodwork, and they might not all be from the U.S.Still, for the time being, investors probably don\u2019t need to be overly concerned about Nvidia facing stiff competition. Rather, it\u2019s the company\u2019s valuation and the overwhelmingly enthusiastic market sentiment that ought to concern the Nvidia perma-bulls.On that topic, a quote from Zhang really resonated with me. \u201cKeep in mind\u2026 the Wall Street touts always encourage you to be most bullish on stocks when they are hot or portrayed as the next big thing in the future,\u201d he warned.That quote is worth writing down and remembering. Now, Nvidia stock is showing signs of exhaustion, but it still trades at 65.6x trailing 12-month earnings (based on total earnings of $1.80 during the past four quarters). Meanwhile, the sector median P/E ratio is 23.5x.Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?On TipRanks, NVDA comes in as a Strong Buy based on 38 Buys and three Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Nvidia stock price target is $156.35, implying 32.4% upside potential.If you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell NVDA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen, with an average return of 126.86% per rating and a 94% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.Conclusion: Should You Consider Nvidia Stock?Nvidia is a niche-market juggernaut, and there\u2019s no point in trying to deny this. At the same time, I agree with Zhang that the market may be \u201coverly optimistic\u201d regarding Nvidia\u2019s future growth assumptions.Many analysts still like Nvidia a lot, and I don\u2019t blame them. As I see it, investing in Nvidia could make a lot of sense, but not at the current share price. Therefore, I am neutral on NVDA stock and would want to see it pull back 20% or even 25% before considering taking a share position.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. for\u00a0MoneyShowFollow AuthorJun 21, 2024, 10:34am EDTShareSaveCommentTech stocks have led this market. Tech fund inflows have been enormous. But we\u2019re seeing some tentative rotation behind the scenes. What does it mean? Will it continue? What other stocks and sectors should you consider \u2013 beyond mega-cap, widely held names like Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)? See what a handful of MoneyShow expert contributors had to say this week.\n\nLucas Downey Mapsignals.com\n\n\nThe appetite for stocks is off the charts\u2026especially mega-cap tech names. This has caused market breadth readings to plummet. But don\u2019t fret, because now\u2019s the time to get ready for a monster reversion trade for the ages. That will help the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP).\n\nBelow we can see how the top stocks in the S&P 500, as tracked by the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), have gained 22.5% in 2024. That easily beats the S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) jump of 15.7% and dramatically crushes the RSP YTD performance of +5.1%.\n\nSPYMAPSignals\nBut MAPsignals is all about bringing you evidence-based research that flies in the face of the talking-heads in the media. Before you bail out on your underperforming stocks, have a look at the following pieces of evidence suggesting you should sit tight. And if you\u2019re bold, start buying the beaten-down dogs.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nI went back and singled out all days when the RSP/SPY ratio fell below 32%. Basically, I needed to understand what we should expect for stocks going forward. That 32% threshold amounts to 201 trading dates that triggered during the Global Financial Crisis lows, the COVID crash lows, and the relative lows seen recently.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened next: The SPY did just fine. But the RSP was spectacular. When the RSP/SPY ratio fell to 32% or lower since 2007:\n\n\nSix months later, the S&P 500 jumped 13% while the S&P 500 Equal Weight basket soared 24.1%\n12-months later, we saw gains of 29.1% for SPY and 47.1% gains for RSP\n24-months after, we saw SPY jump 48.6% and RSP catapult 78%\n\n\n\n RatiosMAPSignals\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: The stock market rally can keep going. Better yet, all stocks should begin to participate in the coming months\u2026and years. If history is a guide, we will be looking at a monster reversion trade where the equal weighted S&P will play catch up to the market bellwethers.\nJohn Eade Argus Research\nMay started strong and, after some wavering toward month-end, finished with a flourish, including the best stock week in 2024 to date. We are encouraged by the double-digit stock-market gain as of end-of-May \u2013 usually a reliable portent of a full-year, double-digit gain. Meanwhile, energy looks more attractive here.\nThe latest report of first-quarter 2024 GDP showed growth of 1.3%, down from 3.4% growth in 4Q23. Personal consumption expenditures for 1Q24 increased 2%, down from 3.3% for 4Q23. All goods spending fell 1.9% in 1Q24, after rising 3% in 4Q23. PCE goods categories were strong in the holiday quarter. Post-holiday, consumers pulled back sharply amid the effects of multi-year inflation.GDP TrendsBureau of Economic Analysis\nOutside GDP, economic indicators generally suggest deceleration, although growth continues at a subdued level. April retail sales were unchanged from March, extending the weak PCE performance in first-quarter GDP. US factory orders rose 1.6% in April, while durable goods orders rose 0.7%. Industrial production dipped 0.3% in April, and capacity utilization of 78.4% was 1.2 points below its long-run (1972-2023) average.\nGiven the realities of the current environment, we lowered our forecast for 2024 GDP growth to 1.8%, from a prior 2%. Our expectations for 2025 GDP growth are in the 2% range.\nStill, five months into 2024, the market is showing impressive sector breadth. Unlike in 2023, the top growth-focused sectors are barely beating the market rather than trouncing it as they did a year earlier. Seven sectors are either tracking or beating the S&P 500.\nBeyond summer, investors are bracing for what could be the most partisan election in the modern era. Yet they are simultaneously anticipating the first rate cut in this cycle, which would also be the first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have adjusted our recommended sector allocations, as we do each quarter at the beginning of March, June, September, and December. The following reflects our guidance for the calendar third quarter of 2024.\nAlthough we use a quantitative, six-part, \u201cblind\u201d sector model, our sector recommendations tend to align with qualitative and fundamental dynamics in the market outlook. We have raised the Energy sector to recommended Market-Weight from recommended Under-Weight. Energy demand appears to have stabilized, as initial consumer euphoria over EVs has cooled, and global economic recovery has put petroleum supply and demand into relative balance.\nThomas Hayes Hedge Fund Tips\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) has been all the rage \u2013 and justifiably so. Since NVDA reported its Q1 2023 earnings and disclosed the huge demand for its AI chips, the stock has gone straight up. But what may go even higher in the short term can go a lot lower in a blink.\nNVDA is now worth $3.3 trillion. Revenues up 4x, margin expansion, etc. \u2013 it\u2019s everything anyone could ever wish for. And as the stock went up, bulls exclaimed it\u2019s getting \u201ccheaper\u201d because as earnings grew, the multiple came down.\nBut now we have a different landscape \u2013 one of decelerating growth. Quarterly revenue growth has gone from 88% to 34% to 18% and is on its way to single digits. Now the multiple is re-accelerating into slowing growth. Next quarter revenue growth guidance is just 7%.Nvidia Corp.QuoteMedia\nAll of the marginal buyers are in \u2013 sucking the last few retail buyers in with the lure of a split. History suggests a short-term bump after a split as we are seeing, but now institutional investors have a vast pool to distribute their shares in coming months. As the saying goes, \u201cwhen the ducks are quacking, feed them.\u201d\nThis does not change the fact that Nvidia is a great business with a great leader \u2013 which will play a role in the advance of AI technologies and productivity. It\u2019s just going to be a heavy lift that it retains a perception of greater value than Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), or the entire German stock market capitalization (where it trades now).\nNVDA is still a semiconductor company, which has never been a secular business \u2013 it\u2019s cyclical. Always has been, always will be. As for 70%+ gross margins, as Bezos famously said, \u201cyour margin is my opportunity.\u201d\nNVDA has not cured cancer. There will be more and more competition going forward. Intel Corp.\u2019s (INTC) Gaudi 3 is 50% faster than NVDA\u2019s H100 and 40% more energy efficient. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is gunning for them. The game is just beginning and NVDA will be forced to share the pie as no buyer wants to be beholden to one company.\nRemember: \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Caveat emptor at these levels.\nMary Ellen McGonagle MEM Edge Report\nMary Ellen McGonagle is senior managing director of equities at Simpler Trading and editor of the MEM Edge Report. In this MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast episode, which you can watch here, we cover the outlook for the stock market, standout sectors like technology, and why the AI boom is NOT like the Dot-Com Bubble all over again.\nWe start by chatting about Mary Ellen\u2019s background covering stocks and fixed income markets for firms like Goldman Sachs and William O\u2019Neil + Company, plus her more recent work for Simpler Trading and the MEM Edge Report. Her aim today? Helping investors with \u201cuncovering these big, winning stocks just as they take off.\u201d\nWe then talk about some of her favorite names, sectors, and the forces driving them, including three top stocks in the semiconductor and communication services sectors. The conversation next pivots to the Federal Reserve and the 10-year Treasury yield...investor sentiment...and the two key technical indicators she watches to determine the health of the markets and uptrends in specific stocks.\nFinally, Mary Ellen spells out the reasons the AI bull market differs from the late 1990s/early 2000s tech stock boom and bust. And she shares a sneak peek at what she\u2019ll cover at the MoneyShow Masters Symposium Las Vegas, set for Aug. 1-3, 2024 at the Paris Las Vegas.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Analysts at BofA Securities recently published a list of \u201cbest of breed\u201d stocks for the third quarter of 2024, which they believe are the top choices for investors on the back of their high quality, liquidity, earnings growth and margin upside when compared with peers. BofA\u2019s \u201cbest of breed\u201d basket of stocks has reportedly outperformed the MSCI All Country World Index (NASDAQ:ACWI) by 584 basis points, and returned a whopping 470% since its inception in April 2010.  Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett thinks these best of breed companies have strong balance sheets, cash flow and high EPS growth as well as competent management. Hartnett believes these companies generate the \u201cbest relative returns\u201d in the long term and can protect investors against short-term volatility. For this article we scanned BofA\u2019s best of breed basket of stocks and picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).

Applications based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) \u2014 a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from specified external sources \u2014 and customized models are enabling developers to tune AI models to their specific needs.\nWhile such work may have required a complex setup in the past, new tools are making it easier than ever.\nNVIDIA AI Workbench simplifies AI developer workflows by helping users build their own RAG projects, customize models and more. It\u2019s part of the RTX AI Toolkit \u2014 a suite of tools and software development kits for customizing, optimizing and deploying AI capabilities \u2014 launched at COMPUTEX earlier this month. AI Workbench removes the complexity of technical tasks that can derail experts and halt beginners.\nWhat Is NVIDIA AI Workbench?\nAvailable for free, NVIDIA AI Workbench enables users to develop, experiment with, test and prototype AI applications across GPU systems of their choice \u2014 from laptops and workstations to data center and cloud. It offers a new approach for creating, using and sharing GPU-enabled development environments across people and systems.\nA simple installation gets users up and running with AI Workbench on a local or remote machine in just minutes. Users can then start a new project or replicate one from the examples on GitHub. Everything works through GitHub or GitLab, so users can easily collaborate and distribute work. Learn more about getting started with AI Workbench.\nHow AI Workbench Helps Address AI Project Challenges\nDeveloping AI workloads can require manual, often complex processes, right from the start.\nSetting up GPUs, updating drivers and managing versioning incompatibilities can be cumbersome. Reproducing projects across different systems can require replicating manual processes over and over. Inconsistencies when replicating projects, like issues with data fragmentation and version control, can hinder collaboration. Varied setup processes, moving credentials and secrets, and changes in the environment, data, models and file locations can all limit the portability of projects.\nAI Workbench makes it easier for data scientists and developers to manage their work and collaborate across heterogeneous platforms. It integrates and automates various aspects of the development process, offering:\n\nEase of setup: AI Workbench streamlines the process of setting up a developer environment that\u2019s GPU-accelerated, even for users with limited technical knowledge.\nSeamless collaboration: AI Workbench integrates with version-control and project-management tools like GitHub and GitLab, reducing friction when collaborating.\nConsistency when scaling from local to cloud: AI Workbench ensures consistency across multiple environments, supporting scaling up or down from local workstations or PCs to data centers or the cloud.\n\nRAG for Documents, Easier Than Ever\nNVIDIA offers sample development Workbench Projects to help users get started with AI Workbench. The hybrid RAG Workbench Project is one example: It runs a custom, text-based RAG web application with a user\u2019s documents on their local workstation, PC or remote system.\nEvery Workbench Project runs in a \u201ccontainer\u201d \u2014 software that includes all the necessary components to run the AI application. The hybrid RAG sample pairs a Gradio chat interface frontend on the host machine with a containerized RAG server \u2014 the backend that services a user\u2019s request and routes queries to and from the vector database and the selected large language model.\nThis Workbench Project supports a wide variety of LLMs available on NVIDIA\u2019s GitHub page. Plus, the hybrid nature of the project lets users select where to run inference.\nWorkbench Projects let users version the development environment and code.\nDevelopers can run the embedding model on the host machine and run inference locally on a Hugging Face Text Generation Inference server, on target cloud resources using NVIDIA inference endpoints like the NVIDIA API catalog, or with self-hosting microservices such as NVIDIA NIM or third-party services.\nThe hybrid RAG Workbench Project also includes:\n\nPerformance metrics: Users can evaluate how RAG- and non-RAG-based user queries perform across each inference mode. Tracked metrics include Retrieval Time, Time to First Token (TTFT) and Token Velocity.\nRetrieval transparency: A panel shows the exact snippets of text \u2014 retrieved from the most contextually relevant content in the vector database \u2014 that are being fed into the LLM and improving the response\u2019s relevance to a user\u2019s query.\nResponse customization: Responses can be tweaked with a variety of parameters, such as maximum tokens to generate, temperature and frequency penalty.\n\nTo get started with this project, simply install AI Workbench on a local system. The hybrid RAG Workbench Project can be brought from GitHub into the user\u2019s account and duplicated to the local system.\nMore resources are available in the AI Decoded user guide. In addition, community members provide helpful video tutorials, like the one from Joe Freeman below.\n\nCustomize, Optimize, Deploy\nDevelopers often seek to customize AI models for specific use cases. Fine-tuning, a technique that changes the model by training it with additional data, can be useful for style transfer or changing model behavior. AI Workbench helps with fine-tuning, as well.\nThe Llama-factory AI Workbench Project enables QLoRa, a fine-tuning method that minimizes memory requirements, for a variety of models, as well as model quantization via a simple graphical user interface. Developers can use public or their own datasets to meet the needs of their applications.\nOnce fine-tuning is complete, the model can be quantized for improved performance and a smaller memory footprint, then deployed to native Windows applications for local inference or to NVIDIA NIM for cloud inference. Find a complete tutorial for this project on the NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit repository.\nTruly Hybrid \u2014 Run AI Workloads Anywhere\nThe Hybrid-RAG Workbench Project described above is hybrid in more than one way. In addition to offering a choice of inference mode, the project can be run locally on NVIDIA RTX workstations and GeForce RTX PCs, or scaled up to remote cloud servers and data centers.\nThe ability to run projects on systems of the user\u2019s choice \u2014 without the overhead of setting up the infrastructure \u2014 extends to all Workbench Projects. Find more examples and instructions for fine-tuning and customization in the AI Workbench quick-start guide.\nFor a more technical perspective, read the blog Optimize AI Model Performance and Maintain Data Privacy with Hybrid RAG.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

The technology can also be applied to industrial environments, healthcare, robotics and other areas.\nThe winning submission received CVPR\u2019s Innovation Award as well, recognizing NVIDIA\u2019s approach to improving \u201cany end-to-end driving model using learned open-loop proxy metrics.\u201d\nIn addition, NVIDIA announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices that enable physically accurate sensor simulation to accelerate the development of fully autonomous machines of every kind.\nHow End-to-End Driving Works\nThe race to develop self-driving cars isn\u2019t a sprint but more a never-ending triathlon, with three distinct yet crucial parts operating simultaneously: AI training, simulation and autonomous driving. Each requires its own accelerated computing platform, and together, the full-stack systems purpose-built for these steps form a powerful triad that enables continuous development cycles, always improving in performance and safety.\nTo accomplish this, a model is first trained on an AI supercomputer such as NVIDIA DGX. It\u2019s then tested and validated in simulation \u2014 using the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and running on an NVIDIA OVX system \u2014 before entering the vehicle, where, lastly, the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform processes sensor data through the model in real time.\nBuilding an autonomous system to navigate safely in the complex physical world is extremely challenging. The system needs to perceive and understand its surrounding environment holistically, then make correct, safe decisions in a fraction of a second. This requires human-like situational awareness to handle potentially dangerous or rare scenarios.\nAV software development has traditionally been based on a modular approach, with separate components for object detection and tracking, trajectory prediction, and path planning and control.\nEnd-to-end autonomous driving systems streamline this process using a unified model to take in sensor input and produce vehicle trajectories, helping avoid overcomplicated pipelines and providing a more holistic, data-driven approach to handle real-world scenarios.\nWatch a video about the Hydra-MDP model, winner of the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge for End-to-End Driving:\n\nNavigating the Grand Challenge\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s CVPR challenge asked participants to develop an end-to-end AV model, trained using the nuPlan dataset, to generate driving trajectory based on sensor data.\nThe models were submitted for testing inside the open-source NAVSIM simulator and were tasked with navigating thousands of scenarios they hadn\u2019t experienced yet. Model performance was scored based on metrics for safety, passenger comfort and deviation from the original recorded trajectory.\nNVIDIA Research\u2019s winning end-to-end model ingests camera and lidar data, as well as the vehicle\u2019s trajectory history, to generate a safe, optimal vehicle path for five seconds post-sensor input.\nThe workflow NVIDIA researchers used to win the competition can be replicated in high-fidelity simulated environments with NVIDIA Omniverse. This means AV simulation developers can recreate the workflow in a physically accurate environment before testing their AVs in the real world. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices will be available later this year. Sign up for early access.\nIn addition, NVIDIA ranked second for its submission to the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge for Driving with Language. NVIDIA\u2019s approach connects vision language models and autonomous driving systems, integrating the power of large language models to help make decisions and achieve generalizable, explainable driving behavior.\nLearn More at CVPR\u00a0\nMore than 50 NVIDIA papers were accepted to this year\u2019s CVPR, on topics spanning automotive, healthcare, robotics and more. Over a dozen papers will cover NVIDIA automotive-related research, including:\n\nHydra-MDP: End-to-End Multimodal Planning With Multi-Target Hydra-Distillation\n\nWinner of CVPR\u2019s End-to-End Driving at Scale challenge\nRead the NVIDIA technical blog\n\n\nProducing and Leveraging Online Map Uncertainty in Trajectory Prediction\n\nCVPR best paper award finalist\n\n\nDriving Everywhere With Large Language Model Policy Adaptation\n\nSee DRIVE Labs: LLM-Based Road Rules Guide Simplifies Driving\n\n\nIs Ego Status All You Need for Open-Loop End-to-End Autonomous Driving?\nImproving Distant 3D Object Detection Using 2D Box Supervision\nDynamic LiDAR Resimulation Using Compositional Neural Fields\nBEVNeXt: Reviving Dense BEV Frameworks for 3D Object Detection\nPARA-Drive: Parallelized Architecture for Real-Time Autonomous Driving\n\nSanja Fidler, vice president of AI research at NVIDIA, will speak on vision language models at the CVPR Workshop on Autonomous Driving.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Research, a global team of hundreds of scientists and engineers focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Generative AI | RoboticsTags: NVIDIA DGX | NVIDIA DRIVE | NVIDIA Research | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to bolster energy efficiency and savings \nSAN FRANCISCO, June 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Databricks, the Data and AI company, today announced an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA during the Data + AI Summit to optimize data and AI workloads by bringing NVIDIA CUDA accelerated computing to the core of Databricks' Data Intelligence Platform. As data prep, curation and processing workloads are essential to using enterprise data for generative AI applications, the companies' work together is designed to boost the efficiency, accuracy and performance of AI development pipelines for modern AI factories. Through this broadened alliance, Databricks is adding native support for NVIDIA GPU acceleration on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. Today's announcement builds on Databricks and NVIDIA's collaboration to offer enriched experiences for enterprises, whether via training classical ML models, building and deploying generative AI applications, or optimizing digital twins.\n\"We're thrilled to continue growing our partnership with NVIDIA to deliver on the promise of data intelligence for our customers from analytics use cases to AI,\" said Ali Ghodsi, Co-founder and CEO at Databricks. \"Together with NVIDIA, we're excited to help every organization build their own AI factories on their own private data.\"\n\"Data is the fuel for the generative AI industrial revolution, so reducing data processing energy demands with accelerated computing is essential to sustainable AI platforms,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"Databricks is the pioneer of large-scale data processing. By bringing NVIDIA CUDA acceleration to Databricks' core computing stack, we're laying the foundation for customers everywhere to use their data to power enterprise generative AI.\"\nDriving Price-Performance with Photon and NVIDIA \nDatabricks plans to develop native support for NVIDIA-accelerated computing in Databricks' next-generation vectorized query engine, Photon, to deliver improved speed and efficiency for customers' data warehousing and analytics workloads.\nPhoton powers Databricks SQL, Databricks' serverless data warehouse with industry-leading price-performance and total cost of ownership (TCO). Databricks and NVIDIA believe this collaboration will lead to the next frontier of price-performance.\nCreating Generative AI Factories with NVIDIA NIM\nAt COMPUTEX, Databricks' open source model DBRX became available as an NVIDIA NIM microservice. NVIDIA NIM inference microservices provide models as fully optimized, pre-built containers for deployment anywhere in order to dramatically increase enterprise developer productivity by providing a simple, standardized way to add generative AI models to their applications.\nLaunched in March 2024, DBRX was built entirely on top of Databricks, leveraging all the tools and techniques available to Databricks customers and partners, and was trained with NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a scalable end-to-end AI platform for developers. Organizations can customize DBRX with enterprise data in order to create organization-specific, high-quality models, or as a reference architecture to build custom DBRX-style mixture of expert (MoE) models from the ground up.\nDatabricks' Data Intelligence Platform offers the most comprehensive platform for building, evaluating, deploying, securing, and monitoring end-to-end generative AI applications. With\u00a0Databricks Mosaic AI's data-centric approach to generative AI, customers benefit from an open, flexible platform to easily scale generative AI applications on their unique data that are safe, accurate and governed.\u00a0\nBuilding on Recent Databricks Momentum\nToday's announcement comes on the heels of Databricks' strategic acquisition of Tabular, a data management startup founded by Ryan Blue, Daniel Weeks, and Jason Reid. By bringing together the original creators of Apache Iceberg\u2122 and Linux Foundation Delta Lake, the two leading open source lakehouse formats, Databricks will lead the way with data compatibility so that organizations are no longer limited by which of these formats their data is in. Databricks also recently announced it is doubling down on its Delta Sharing open ecosystem with product innovations and strategic partnerships, enabling customers to efficiently break down data silos and unlock AI innovation.\nDriven by the surge in demand for data and AI capabilities, Databricks reached over $1.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, representing over 50% year-over-year growth.\nAbout Databricks\nDatabricks is the Data and AI company.

Once a niche format supported by only a few boutique builders, SFF is now part of many top case manufacturers\u2019 line-ups.\nComponent compatibility remains a challenge, however, requiring prospective buyers to dive into specification sheets and ask other enthusiasts whether there\u2019s available space and clearance for parts, cables, and assembly. GeForce RTX graphics cards come in all shapes and sizes, and though partners\u2019 pages list product dimensions, clearances for power cables and connectors generally aren\u2019t referenced, necessitating guess work and further research to ensure the graphics card is SFF-suitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re working in partnership with graphics card and case manufacturers to make component choice simpler by introducing a new SFF-Ready guideline for GeForce RTX enthusiast graphics cards and cases. This new guideline will instantly tell you whether a graphics card fits in a SFF case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As enthusiastic supporters of the small form factor community, we are proud to partner with NVIDIA to deliver powerful performance in compact, space-saving designs. Our SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce graphics cards and cases allow PC enthusiasts to experience the full potential of SFF technology.\u201d - Kent Chien, Corporate Vice President, General Manager of Multimedia BU, ASUS\nManufacturer product pages and listings on global retailers have text labeling graphics cards that meet the guideline as \u201cSFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards\u201d, and cases as being \u201cCompatible with SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards\u201d, instantly identifying parts that fit together and allowing you to buy and build with

They\u2019re also small enough to sit behind a monitor or to the side on a standard width desk, and can be tucked away easily in a cupboard when not in use.\nSFF gaming PCs are also great for LAN parties, enabling you to carry your kudos-earning, super powerful system with ease to and from the event. They\u2019re also a perfect pick for someone who moves homes a lot. And you can even travel with a fully built SFF PC in an airline-accepted, hand luggage-sized case, ready to be plugged into a TV at your destination.\nTake a look at some of the latest Small Form Factor cases from Fractal Design, Cooler Master, Thermaltake, InWin, and more that are compatible with SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards in our gallery below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven More SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards and Compatible Cases Available Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to build a Small Form Factor PC, now\u2019s the time; it\u2019s easier than ever to determine whether the graphics card will fit in a SFF case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\nGraphics Cards\n\n\nLaptops\n\n\nG-SYNC Monitors\n\n\nGeForce NOW Cloud Gaming\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & News\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nCommunity Forums\n\n\nCommunity Portal\n\n\nDeveloper Resources\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDrivers\n\n\nPurchase Support\n\n\nTechnical Support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow GeForce\n\nFacebook\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nTwitch\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t           United States\n\t\t        \n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nManage My Privacy\n\n\nDo Not Sell or Share My Data\n\n\nTerms of Service\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nCorporate Policies\n\n\nProduct Security\n\n\nContact\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia\u2019s stock price has more than doubled this year after more than tripling in 2023 and it\u2019s now the third most valuable company in the S&P 500. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to briefly surpass Apple last week as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market value.The chipmaker has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. The company\u2019s revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier. Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here\u2019s a look:\n\n$3.011 TrillionNvidia\u2019s total market value as of Wednesday. Earlier this year, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.168 trillion) and Apple ($3.029 trillion). The company was valued at around $418 billion two years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion, the largest deal in company history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich US companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtah becomes the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify ages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$147 billionThat\u2019s the one-day increase in Nvidia\u2019s market value on Wednesday.10 for 1The company\u2019s 10-for-1 stock split went into effect at the close of trading on Friday. The move gives each investor nine additional shares for every share they already own. Companies often conduct stock splits to make their shares more affordable for investors. Nvidia\u2019s stock closed Wednesday at $1,224.40 and it\u2019s just one of 11 companies in the S&P 500 with a share price over $1,000. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$26 billionRevenue for Nvidia\u2019s most recent fiscal quarter. That\u2019s more than triple the $7.2 billion it reported in the same period a year ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia to bring in revenue of $117 billion in fiscal 2025, which would be close to double its revenue in 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\n53.4%Nvidia\u2019s estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple\u2019s net margin was 26.3% in its most recent quarter and Microsoft\u2019s was 36.4%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeland Security says professor deported to Lebanon with US visa supported Hezbollah leader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

This will enable salespeople to visualize 3D product digital twins directly in SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation. NVIDIA Omniverse, based on OpenUSD, lets users simulate how configurable equipment might physically fit into and operate in the real world, saving time and costs while improving efficiency and safety.\nThese new advances come after the companies announced AI-focused collaborations at GTC in March.\n\u201cOne of the most amazing breakthroughs in large language models and generative AI is that we\u2019ve managed to learn the representation of almost any language,\u201d said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang, speaking by video link at the SAP Sapphire conference. \u201cIn our company, the most valuable language is CUDA. At SAP, the most valuable language is ABAP.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created some amazing generative APIs that understand the language of SAP, that understand the language of supply chains, that understand the language of ERP systems, so that we have a specialist, an agent and AI to help us to do all the things that we want to do to manage our business,\u201d said SAP CEO Christian Klein.\nNVIDIA AI Helps to Accelerate Joule, SAP\u2019s Generative AI Copilot\u00a0\u00a0\nJoule, which is embedded across SAP\u2019s portfolio of cloud solutions and applications, allows users to work faster while gaining smarter insights grounded in business data. At SAP Sapphire, the company announced a new consulting capability for Joule leveraging NVIDIA NeMo Retriever microservices.\nNVIDIA NeMo Retriever connects AI applications with proprietary data to drive retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. This brings domain expertise and knowledge of the business to LLMs so that AI copilots and coding assistants can give more accurate and relevant responses.\nWith the new AI-powered SAP Consulting capabilities \u2014 connected to 200,000 pages of SAP learning content, help, product documentation, and community content \u2014 tens of thousands of SAP consultants can be more productive, while accessing the latest product and process details when working with end customers. Joule\u2019s SAP Consulting capabilities are already being previewed by internal SAP consultants as well as leading system integrators.\nNVIDIA-powered AI is also coming to assist the more than 5 million developers using SAP\u2019s ABAP programming language. SAP\u2019s custom model was trained on over 250 million lines of proprietary ABAP code using NVIDIA HGX H100 systems and will be deployed using NVIDIA NIM inference microservices for optimal runtime performance. Joule\u2019s ABAP Developer capabilities can help developers generate, complete and explain code as well as create software unit tests, which allows them to spend more time building and deploying features rather than manually writing lines of code.\nAs announced at GTC 2024, this NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including NeMo and NIM, is expected to be accessible in the generative AI hub in SAP AI Core for developers and customers to leverage.\nOmniverse to Help Optimize Sales Processes for Complex Products\nUsing NVIDIA AI and Omniverse, SAP is building the future of connectivity and is reimagining key business processes, including the sales process for manufacturers.\nSAP Intelligent Product Recommendation software utilizes generative AI to analyze requirements described in natural language and generate recommendations for the most suitable configurable products. With Omniverse Cloud APIs integrated with the application, users can then interact with physically accurate models of complex products in a digital twin of the environment where they will be installed. This lets sales teams generate quotes more quickly and helps sales representatives recommend the best solutions for their customers\u2019 needs.\n\nIn addition, SAP Intelligent Product Recommendation can use NVIDIA AI to analyze text from multiple sources, including emails and notes captured in customer relationship management software or from product specifications documents. This lets the software generate\u00a0 recommendations based on key, custom parameters, such as power requirements, lead times and expected carbon footprint.\nWatch the replay of the Sapphire Orlando keynote here.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

efficiency.\u00a0\t\t\t\n\n\nJune 12, 2024 by Anne Hecht \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Accelerated computing is transforming data processing and analytics for enterprises, declared NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang Wednesday during an on-stage chat with Databricks cofounder and CEO Ali Ghodsi at the Databricks Data + AI Summit 2024.\n\u201cEvery company\u2019s business data is their gold mine,\u201d Huang said, explaining that every company has enormous amounts of data, but extracting insights and distilling intelligence from it has been challenging.\n\nDatabricks Leverages NVIDIA\u2019s Full Stack to Accelerate Generative AI Applications\nTo unlock all that intelligence, Huang and Ghodsi announced the integration of NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing with Databricks Photon, Databricks\u2019 engine for fast data processing, designed to power Databricks SQL with top-tier performance and cost efficiency.\n\u201cThis is a big announcement,\u201d Huang said, adding that accelerated computing and generative AI are the two most important technological trends today. \u201cNVIDIA and Databricks are going to partner to combine our skills in these areas and bring them to all of you.\u201d\nHuang shared that it\u2019s taken NVIDIA five years to build a set of libraries that make it possible to accelerate Photon, allowing users to \u201cwrangle data faster, more cost-effectively and consume a lot less energy.\u201d\n\u201cWe are super-excited to partner with you to use GPU acceleration on the Photon engine to enhance core data processing and get them to also run on NVIDIA GPUs,\u201d Ghodsi said.\nCreating Generative AI Factories With NVIDIA NIM\nNVIDIA and Databricks also announced that Databricks\u2019 open-source model DBRX is now available as an NVIDIA NIM microservice hosted on the NVIDIA API catalog.\nNVIDIA NIM inference microservices provide models as fully optimized, pre-built containers for deployment anywhere.\n\u201cCreating these endpoints is complicated,\u201d Huang explained. \u201cWe optimized everything into a microservice, which runs on every cloud and on premises.\u201d\nMicroservices dramatically increase enterprise developer productivity by providing a simple, standardized way to add generative AI models to applications.\nLaunched in March, DBRX was built entirely on top of Databricks, leveraging all the tools and techniques available to Databricks customers and partners, and was trained with NVIDIA DGX Cloud, a scalable end-to-end AI platform for developers.\nOrganizations can customize DBRX with enterprise data to create high-quality, organization-specific models or use it to build a custom DBRX-style mixture of expert models as a reference architecture.\nHuang said that accelerating data processing is a huge opportunity, encouraging everyone to put accelerated computing and generative AI to work.\n\u201cWhatever you do, just start \u2014 you have to engage in this incredibly fast-moving train,\u201d Huang said. \u201cRemember, generative AI is growing exponentially \u2014 you don\u2019t want to wait and observe an exponential trend, because in a couple of years, you\u2019ll be so far behind.\u201d\nJoining the Conversation\nAttendees at the summit are encouraged to participate in sessions and engage with NVIDIA experts to learn more about how NVIDIA and Databricks are driving the future of AI and data intelligence.\nKey sessions, taking place June 13, include:\n\n\u201cDevelopment and Deployment of

Don\u2019t let it fly by because you can use it to transform your business or go into new businesses,\u201d said Huang, the day after he gave a keynote kicking off COMPUTEX in Taiwan.\nSnowflake Users Can Tap Into NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nFor example, businesses will be able to deploy Snowflake Arctic, an enterprise-focused large language model (LLM), in seconds using NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\u00a0\nArctic was trained on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and is available on the NVIDIA API catalog, fully supported by NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, software that accelerates generative AI inference.\nThe two companies also will integrate Snowflake Cortex AI and NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, so businesses can link their AI-powered applications to information sources, ensuring highly accurate results with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nRamaswamy gave examples of generative AI applications developed with the NVIDIA NeMo framework and Snowpark Container Services that will be available on Snowflake Marketplace for use by thousands of Snowflake customers.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s industry-leading accelerated computing is game changing for our customers and our own research team that used it to create the state-of-the-art Artic model for our customers,\u201d said Ramaswamy.\nTo learn more, watch NVIDIA GTC on-demand sessions presented by Snowflake on how to build chatbots with a RAG architecture and how to leverage LLMs for life sciences.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | Events | Inference | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA NeMo | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Something unconventional, something unexplored. But let it be informed, and let it be reasoned, and dedicate yourself to making that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may find your GPU. You may find your CUDA. You may find your generative AI. You may find your NVIDIA.\u201d\nTrading his signature leather jacket for black and yellow academic regalia, Huang addressed the nearly 600 graduates at their commencement ceremony in Pasadena, Calif., starting with the tale of the computing industry\u2019s decades-long evolution to reach this pivotal moment of AI transformation.\n\u201cComputers today are the single most important instrument of knowledge, and it\u2019s foundational to every single industry in every field of science,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAs you enter industry, it\u2019s important you know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nHe shared how, over a decade ago, NVIDIA \u2014 a small company at the time \u2014 bet on deep learning, investing billions of dollars and years of engineering resources to reinvent every computing layer.\n\u201cNo one knew how far deep learning could scale, and if we didn\u2019t build it, we\u2019d never know,\u201d Huang said. Referencing the famous line from Field of Dreams \u2014 if you build it, he will come \u2014 he said, \u201cOur logic is: If we don\u2019t build it, they can\u2019t come.\u201d\nLooking to the future, Huang said, the next wave of AI is robotics, a field where NVIDIA\u2019s journey resulted from a series of setbacks.\nHe reflected on a period in NVIDIA\u2019s past when the company each year built new products that \u201cwould be incredibly successful, generate enormous amounts of excitement. And then one year later, we were kicked out of those markets.\u201d\nThese roadblocks pushed NVIDIA to seek out untapped areas \u2014 what Huang refers to as \u201czero-billion-dollar markets.\u201d\n\u201cWith no more markets to turn to, we decided to build something where we are sure there are no customers,\u201d Huang said. \u201cBecause one of the things you can definitely guarantee is where there are no customers, there are also no competitors.\u201d\nRobotics was that new market. NVIDIA built the first robotics computer, Huang said, processing a deep learning algorithm. Over a decade later, that pivot has given the company the opportunity to create the next wave of AI.\n\u201cOne setback after another, we shook it off and skated to the next opportunity. Each time, we gain skills and strengthen our character,\u201d Huang said. \u201cNo setback that comes our way doesn\u2019t look like an opportunity these days.\u201d\nHuang stressed the importance of resilience and agility as superpowers that strengthen character.\n\u201cThe world can be unfair and deal you with tough cards. Swiftly shake it off,\u201d he said, with a tongue-in-cheek reference to one of Taylor Swift\u2019s biggest hits. \u201cThere\u2019s another opportunity out there \u2014 or create one.\u201d\nHuang concluded by sharing a story from his travels to Japan, where, as he watched a gardener painstakingly tending to Kyoto\u2019s famous moss garden, he realized that when a person is dedicated to their craft and prioritizes doing their life\u2019s work, they always have plenty of time.\n\u201cPrioritize your life,\u201d he said, \u201cand you will have plenty of time to do the important things.\u201d\n\nMain image courtesy of Caltech.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | NVIDIA LifeTags: Education \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Investors now say the company is worth over $3.3 trillion.Nvidia has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. Revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier. The company\u2019s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here\u2019s a look:$3.334 TrillionNvidia\u2019s total market value as of the close Tuesday. It edged past Microsoft ($3.317 trillion). Apple is the third most-valuable company ($3.286 trillion). One year ago, the company had just crossed the $1 trillion threshold.$113 billionThe one-day increase in Nvidia\u2019s market value on Tuesday.$135.58Nvidia\u2019s closing stock price Tuesday. Two weeks ago the stock traded at more than $1,200, but the company completed a 10-for-1 stock split after trading closed on June 7. That gave each investor nine additional shares for every share they already owned. Companies with a high stock price often conduct stock splits to make the stock more affordable for investors.\n\n$119.9 billionAnalysts\u2019 estimate for Nvidia\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That would be about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK watchdog drops competition review of Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft shutting down Skype in May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft workers protest sale of AI and cloud services to Israeli military\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53.4%Nvidia\u2019s estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned into profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple\u2019s net margin was 26.3% in its most recent quarter and Microsoft\u2019s was 36.4%.

Early last week, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as Wall Street\u2019s most valuable public company. Then it fell 13% over three days, its worst such stretch since 2022. Because Nvidia has become so massive in size, the movements for its stock carry extra weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes.Any stock that climbs as much as Nvidia has \u2014 up more than 1,000% since the autumn of 2022 \u2014 is vulnerable to some of its investors selling shares in order to lock in some profits. That earlier run makes a 13% drop over three days look like a relative trifle.Monday, Nvidia shares rose 6.8%, bringing its market value to $3.10 trillion, behind Microsoft at $3.35 trillion and Apple at $3.21 trillion.Those three companies and a few others are responsible for much of the S&P 500\u2019s returns recently. Investors would prefer a market where many stocks are participating in the gains. \n\nThere\u2019s been nearly insatiable demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips to power artificial intelligence applications and the company has played a big role in the U.S. stock market\u2019s recent record runs even as the economy\u2019s growth slows under the weight of high interest rates. But the AI boom is moving at such a rapid pace that it\u2019s raised worries about a possible bubble in the stock market and too-high expectations among investors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in the biggest deal in company\u2019s history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK watchdog drops competition review of Microsoft\u2019s OpenAI deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft shutting down Skype in May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a statement that while Nvidia\u2019s stock has declined in recent days, one must also look at the bigger picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe shares have still gained 190% on a 12-month view, so it\u2019s no surprise some investors are locking in some profits,\u201d he said.Nathan also isn\u2019t concerned about potential wider spread implications. \u201cAlthough Nvidia has sneezed, the wider market hasn\u2019t caught a cold with a mixture of less extreme movements in both directions for the rest of the Magnificent 7,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Magnificent 7, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, are a small group of stocks that are responsible for a big chunk of the U.S. stock market\u2019s total return. Some critics say Nvidia still looks expensive. Its stock is trading at a price that\u2019s 73 times higher than the profit that it\u2019s produced over the last 12 months. That makes it look much more expensive than the broad S&P 500 index, where companies are trading at just 26 times their overall earnings. That itself looks pricey to skeptics, who say the broad U.S. stock market looks expensive compared with history.The thing Nvidia has going for it is the possibility of continued, incredible growth as it ushers in a new era that proponents say will remake the economy.Based on its expected profit over the next 12 months, Nvidia is trading at a still expensive but more reasonable price-earnings ratio of roughly 40. And if generative AI hardware deployments are still only in year two of what could be a three-to-five year deployment cycle, as analysts at Bank of America suggest, the possible runway of growth could make it look even more compelling.Analysts estimate that the company\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025 will reach $119.9 billion \u2014 about double its revenue for fiscal 2024 and more than four times its receipts the year before that.\n\n__Associated Press Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this report. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

The 98 billion parameter ESM3 model uses roughly 25x more flops and 60x more data than its predecessor, ESM2.\nThe company, which developed a database of more than 2 billion protein sequences to train its AI model, offers technology that can provide clues applicable to drug development, disease eradication and, literally, how humans have evolved at scale as a species \u2014 as its name suggests \u2014 for drug discovery researchers.\nAccelerating In Silico Biological Research With ESM3\nWith leaps in training data, EvolutionaryScale aims to accelerate protein discovery with ESM3.\nThe model was trained on almost 2.8 billion protein sequences sampled from organisms and biomes, allowing scientists to prompt the model to identify and validate new proteins with increasing levels of accuracy.\nESM3 offers significant updates over previous versions. The model is natively generative, and it is an \u201call to all\u201d model, meaning structure and function annotations can be provided as input rather than just as output.\nOnce it\u2019s made publicly available, scientists can fine-tune this base model to construct purpose-built models based on their own proprietary data. The boost in protein engineering capabilities due to ESM3\u2019s large-scale generative training across enormous amounts of data offers a time-traveling machine for in silico biological research.\nDriving the Next Big Breakthroughs With NVIDIA BioNeMo\nESM3 provides biologists and protein designers with a generative AI boost, helping improve their engineering and understanding of proteins. With simple prompts, it can generate new proteins with a provided scaffold, self-improve its protein design based on feedback and design proteins based on the functionality that the user indicates. These capabilities can be used in tandem in any combination to provide chain-of-thought protein design as if the user were messaging a researcher who had memorized the intricate three-dimensional meaning of every protein sequence known to humans and had learned the language fluently, enabling users to iterate back and forth.\n\u201cIn our internal testing we\u2019ve been impressed by the ability of ESM3 to creatively respond to a variety of complex prompts,\u201d said Tom Sercu, co-founder and VP of engineering at EvolutionaryScale. \u201cIt was able to solve an extremely hard protein design problem to create a novel Green Fluorescent Protein. We expect ESM3 will help scientists accelerate their work and open up new possibilities \u2014 we\u2019re looking forward to seeing how it will contribute to future research in the life sciences.\u201d\nEvolutionaryScale will be opening an API for closed beta today and code and weights are available for a small open version of ESM3 for non-commercial use. This version is coming soon to NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI platform for drug discovery. The full ESM3 family of models will soon be available to select customers as an NVIDIA NIM microservice, run-time optimized in collaboration with NVIDIA, and supported by an NVIDIA AI Enterprise software license for testing at ai.nvidia.com.\nThe computing power required to train these models is growing exponentially. ESM3 was trained using the Andromeda cluster, which uses NVIDIA H100 GPUs and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking.\nThe ESM3 model will be available on select partner platforms, including Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Sagemaker, AWS HealthOMICs and NVIDIA BioNeMo.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: ResearchTags: NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Earlier this year, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.073 trillion) and Apple ($2.975 trillion). The company was valued at around $418 billion two years ago.\n\n53.4%Nvidia\u2019s estimated net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, about 53 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple\u2019s net margin was 26.3% in its most recent quarter and Microsoft\u2019s was 36.4%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Why is batch size important? And how do they help determine how fast AI computes?\t\t\t\n\n\nJune 12, 2024 by Jesse Clayton \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Editor\u2019s note: This post is part of the AI Decoded series, which demystifies AI by making the technology more accessible, and showcases new hardware, software, tools and accelerations for RTX PC users.\nThe era of the AI PC is here, and it\u2019s powered by NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX technologies. With it comes a new way to evaluate performance for AI-accelerated tasks, and a new language that can be daunting to decipher when choosing between the desktops and laptops available.\nWhile PC gamers understand frames per second (FPS) and similar stats, measuring AI performance requires new metrics.\nComing Out on TOPS\nThe first baseline is TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. Trillions is the important word here \u2014 the processing numbers behind generative AI tasks are absolutely massive. Think of TOPS as a raw performance metric, similar to an engine\u2019s horsepower rating. More is better.\nCompare, for example, the recently announced Copilot+ PC lineup by Microsoft, which includes neural processing units (NPUs) able to perform upwards of 40 TOPS. Performing 40 TOPS is sufficient for some light AI-assisted tasks, like asking a local chatbot where yesterday\u2019s notes are.\nBut many generative AI tasks are more demanding. NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs deliver unprecedented performance across all generative tasks \u2014 the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU offers more than 1,300 TOPS. This is the kind of horsepower needed to handle AI-assisted digital content creation, AI super resolution in PC gaming, generating images from text or video, querying local large language models (LLMs) and more.\nInsert Tokens to Play\nTOPS is only the beginning of the story. LLM performance is measured in the number of tokens generated by the model.\nTokens are the output of the LLM. A token can be a word in a sentence, or even a smaller fragment like punctuation or whitespace. Performance for AI-accelerated tasks can be measured in \u201ctokens per second.\u201d\nAnother important factor is batch size, or the number of inputs processed simultaneously in a single inference pass. As an LLM will sit at the core of many modern AI systems, the ability to handle multiple inputs (e.g. from a single application or across multiple applications) will be a key differentiator. While larger batch sizes improve performance for concurrent inputs, they also require more memory, especially when combined with larger models.\nThe more you batch, the more (time) you save.\nRTX GPUs are exceptionally well-suited for LLMs due to their large amounts of dedicated video random access memory (VRAM), Tensor Cores and TensorRT-LLM software.\nGeForce RTX GPUs offer up to 24GB of high-speed VRAM, and NVIDIA RTX GPUs up to 48GB, which can handle larger models and enable higher batch sizes. RTX GPUs also take advantage of Tensor Cores \u2014 dedicated AI accelerators that dramatically speed up the computationally intensive operations required for deep learning and generative AI models. That maximum performance is easily accessed when an application uses the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit (SDK), which unlocks the highest-performance generative AI on the more than 100 million Windows PCs and workstations powered by RTX GPUs.\nThe combination of memory, dedicated AI accelerators and optimized software gives RTX GPUs massive throughput gains, especially as batch sizes increase.\nText-to-Image, Faster Than Ever\nMeasuring image generation speed is another way to evaluate performance. One of the most straightforward ways uses Stable Diffusion, a popular image-based AI model that allows users to easily convert text descriptions into complex visual representations.\n\nWith Stable Diffusion, users can quickly create and refine images from text prompts to achieve their desired output. When using an RTX GPU, these results can be generated faster than processing the AI model on a CPU or NPU.\nThat performance is even higher when using the TensorRT extension for the popular Automatic1111 interface. RTX users can generate images from prompts up to 2x faster with the SDXL Base checkpoint \u2014 significantly streamlining Stable Diffusion workflows.\nComfyUI, another popular Stable Diffusion user interface, added TensorRT acceleration last week. RTX users can now generate images from prompts up to 60% faster, and can even convert these images to videos using Stable Video Diffuson up to 70% faster with TensorRT.\n\nTensorRT acceleration can be put to the test in the new UL Procyon AI Image Generation benchmark, which delivers speedups of 50% on a GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER GPU compared with the fastest non-TensorRT implementation.\nTensorRT acceleration will soon be released for Stable Diffusion 3 \u2014 Stability AI\u2019s new, highly anticipated text-to-image model \u2014 boosting performance by 50%. Plus, the new TensorRT-Model Optimizer enables accelerating performance even further. This results in a 70% speedup compared with the non-TensorRT implementation, along with a 50% reduction in memory consumption.\nOf course, seeing is believing \u2014 the true test is in the real-world use case of iterating on an original prompt. Users can refine image generation by tweaking prompts significantly faster on RTX GPUs, taking seconds per iteration compared with minutes on a Macbook Pro M3 Max. Plus, users get both speed and security with everything remaining private when running locally on an RTX-powered PC or workstation.\nThe Results Are in and Open Sourced\nBut don\u2019t just take our word for it. The team of AI researchers and engineers behind the open-source Jan.ai recently integrated TensorRT-LLM into its local chatbot app, then tested these optimizations for themselves.\nSource: Jan.ai\nThe researchers tested its implementation of TensorRT-LLM against the open-source llama.cpp inference engine across a variety of GPUs and CPUs used by the community. They found that TensorRT is \u201c30-70% faster than llama.cpp on the same hardware,\u201d as well as more efficient on consecutive processing runs. The team also included its methodology, inviting others to measure generative AI performance for themselves.\nFrom games to generative AI, speed wins. TOPS, images per second, tokens per second and batch size are all considerations when determining performance champs.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

These technologies use deep neural networks to generate realistic and novel outputs, such as text, images, audio and video, based on a given input or context. Generative AI and LLMs can be used for a variety of applications, such as copilots, chatbots and other content creation.\u00a0\nHowever, generative AI and LLMs also pose significant challenges for NCPs, which need to provide the infrastructure and software to support these workloads. The technologies require massive amounts of computing power, storage and network bandwidth, as well as specialized hardware and software to optimize performance and efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example, LLM training involves many GPU servers working together, communicating constantly among themselves and with storage systems. This translates to east-west and north-south traffic in data centers, which requires high-performance networks for fast and efficient communication.\u00a0\u00a0\nSimilarly, generative AI inference with larger models needs multiple GPUs to work together to process a single query.\u00a0\nMoreover, NCPs need to ensure that their infrastructure is secure, reliable and scalable, as they serve multiple customers with different needs and expectations. NCPs also need to comply with industry standards and best practices, as well as provide support and maintenance for their services.\u00a0\nThe NCP reference architecture addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, full-stack hardware and software solution for cloud providers to offer AI services and workflows for different use cases. Based on the years of experience NVIDIA has in designing and building large-scale deployments both internally and for customers, the reference architecture includes:\u00a0\n\nGPU servers from NVIDIA and its manufacturing partners, featuring NVIDIA\u2019s latest GPU architectures, such as Hopper and Blackwell, which deliver unparalleled compute power and performance for AI workloads.\u00a0\nStorage offerings from certified partners, which provide high-performance storage optimized for AI and LLM workloads. The offerings also include those tested and validated for NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and NVIDIA DGX Cloud. They are proven to be reliable, efficient and scalable.\u00a0\nNVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet networking, which provide a high-performance east-west network for fast and efficient communication between GPU servers.\u00a0\nNVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs, which deliver high-performance north-south network connectivity and enable data storage acceleration, elastic GPU computing and zero-trust security.\u00a0\nIn/out-of-band management solutions from NVIDIA and management partners, which provide tools and services for provisioning, monitoring and managing AI data center infrastructure.\u00a0\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBase Command Manager Essentials, which helps cloud providers provision and manage their servers.\u00a0\nNeMo framework, which helps cloud providers train and fine-tune generative AI models.\u00a0\nNVIDIA NIM, a set of easy-to-use microservices designed to accelerate deployment of generative AI across enterprises.\u00a0\nRiva, for speech services.\u00a0\nNVIDIA RAPIDS accelerator for managed Spark services.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe NCP reference architecture offers the following key benefits to partners:\u00a0\n\nBuild, Train and Go: NVIDIA infrastructure specialists highly experienced team use the architecture to physically install and provision the cluster for faster rollouts for cloud providers.\u00a0\nSpeed: By incorporating the expertise and best practices of NVIDIA and its partners, the architecture can help cloud providers accelerate the deployment of AI solutions and gain a competitive edge in the market.\u00a0\nHigh Performance: The architecture is tuned and benchmarked with industry-standard benchmarks, ensuring optimal performance for AI workloads.\u00a0\nScalability: The architecture is designed for cloud-native environments, facilitating the development of scalable AI systems that offer flexibility and can seamlessly expand to meet increasing demand of end users.\u00a0\nInteroperability: The architecture ensures compatibility among various components of the architecture from NVIDIA\u2019s partners, making integration and communication between components seamless.\u00a0\nMaintenance and Support: NCPs have access to NVIDIA subject-matter experts, who can help address any unexpected challenges that may arise during and after deployment.\u00a0\n\nThe NCP reference architecture provides a proven blueprint for cloud providers to establish and manage high-performance scalable infrastructure for AI data centers. Both NCPs and customers benefit from the comprehensive guidelines this architecture offers.\u00a0\nUpdate: NVIDIA announced in October 2024 a new Reference Platform NCP designation for select partners who operate large clusters built in coordination with NVIDIA and that adhere to a tested and optimized reference architecture. Reference Platform NCPs may offer the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform and easy-to-use NVIDIA NIM microservices to help customers build and deploy AI applications.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Data Center | Generative AITags: Cloud Services | NVIDIA NeMo \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here is a link to the video instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  NVIDIA researchers are at the forefront of the rapidly advancing field of visual generative AI, developing new techniques to create and interpret images, videos and 3D environments.\nMore than 50 of these projects will be showcased at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference, taking place June 17-21 in Seattle. Two of the papers \u2014 one on the training dynamics of diffusion models and another on high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles \u2014 are finalists for CVPR\u2019s Best Paper Awards.\nNVIDIA is also the winner of the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge\u2019s End-to-End Driving at Scale track \u2014 a significant milestone that demonstrates the company\u2019s use of generative AI for comprehensive self-driving models. The winning submission, which outperformed more than 450 entries worldwide, also received CVPR\u2019s Innovation Award.\nNVIDIA\u2019s research at CVPR includes a text-to-image model that can be easily customized to depict a specific object or character, a new model for object pose estimation, a technique to edit neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and a visual language model that can understand memes. Additional papers introduce domain-specific innovations for industries including automotive, healthcare and robotics.\nCollectively, the work introduces powerful AI models that could enable creators to more quickly bring their artistic visions to life, accelerate the training of autonomous robots for manufacturing, and support healthcare professionals by helping process radiology reports.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence, and generative AI in particular, represents a pivotal technological advancement,\u201d said Jan Kautz, vice president of learning and perception research at NVIDIA. \u201cAt CVPR, NVIDIA Research is sharing how we\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible \u2014 from powerful image generation models that could supercharge professional creators to autonomous driving software that could help enable next-generation self-driving cars.\u201d\nAt CVPR, NVIDIA also announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices that enable physically accurate sensor simulation to accelerate the development of fully autonomous machines of every kind.\nForget Fine-Tuning: JeDi Simplifies Custom Image Generation\nCreators harnessing diffusion models, the most popular method for generating images based on text prompts, often have a specific character or object in mind \u2014 they may, for example, be developing a storyboard around an animated mouse or brainstorming an ad campaign for a specific toy.\nPrior research has enabled these creators to personalize the output of diffusion models to focus on a specific subject using fine-tuning \u2014 where a user trains the model on a custom dataset \u2014 but the process can be time-consuming and inaccessible for general users.\nJeDi, a paper by researchers from Johns Hopkins University, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago and NVIDIA, proposes a new technique that allows users to easily personalize the output of a diffusion model within a couple of seconds using reference images. The team found that the model achieves state-of-the-art quality, significantly outperforming existing fine-tuning-based and fine-tuning-free methods.\nJeDi can also be combined with retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, to generate visuals specific to a database, such as a brand\u2019s product catalog.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JeDi-cow-sculpture.mp4\n\u00a0\nNew Foundation Model Perfects the Pose\nNVIDIA researchers at CVPR are also presenting FoundationPose, a foundation model for object pose estimation and tracking that can be instantly applied to new objects during inference, without the need for fine-tuning.\nThe model, which set a new record on a popular benchmark for object pose estimation, uses either a small set of reference images or a 3D representation of an object to understand its shape. It can then identify and track how that object moves and rotates in 3D across a video, even in poor lighting conditions or complex scenes with visual obstructions.\nFoundationPose could be used in industrial applications to help autonomous robots identify and track the objects they interact with. It could also be used in augmented reality applications where an AI model is used to overlay visuals on a live scene.\n\nNeRFDeformer Transforms 3D Scenes With a Single Snapshot\nA NeRF is an AI model that can render a 3D scene based on a series of 2D images taken from different positions in the environment. In fields like robotics, NeRFs can be used to generate immersive 3D renders of complex real-world scenes, such as a cluttered room or a construction site. However, to make any changes, developers would need to manually define how the scene has transformed \u2014 or remake the NeRF entirely.\nResearchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and NVIDIA have simplified the process with NeRFDeformer. The method, being presented at CVPR, can successfully transform an existing NeRF using a single RGB-D image, which is a combination of a normal photo and a depth map that captures how far each object in a scene is from the camera.\n\nVILA Visual Language Model Gets the Picture\nA CVPR research collaboration between NVIDIA and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is advancing the state of the art for vision language models, which are generative AI models that can process videos, images and text.\nThe group developed VILA, a family of open-source visual language models that outperforms prior neural networks on key benchmarks that test how well AI models answer questions about images. VILA\u2019s unique pretraining process unlocked new model capabilities, including enhanced world knowledge, stronger in-context learning and the ability to reason across multiple images.\nVILA can understand memes and reason based on multiple images or video frames.\nThe VILA model family can be optimized for inference using the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM open-source library and can be deployed on NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, workstations and even edge devices.\nRead more about VILA on the NVIDIA Technical Blog and GitHub.\nGenerative AI Fuels Autonomous Driving, Smart City Research\nA dozen of the NVIDIA-authored CVPR papers focus on autonomous vehicle research. Other AV-related highlights include:\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s AV applied research, which won the CVPR Autonomous Grand Challenge, is featured in this demo.\nSanja Fidler, vice president of AI research at NVIDIA, will present on vision language models at the Workshop on Autonomous Driving on June 17.\nProducing and Leveraging Online Map Uncertainty in Trajectory Prediction, a paper authored by researchers from the University of Toronto and NVIDIA, has been selected as one of 24 finalists for CVPR\u2019s best paper award.\n\nAlso at CVPR, NVIDIA contributed the largest ever indoor synthetic dataset to the AI City Challenge, helping researchers and developers advance the development of solutions for smart cities and industrial automation. The challenge\u2019s datasets were generated using NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform of APIs, SDKs and services that enable developers to build Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based applications and workflows.\nNVIDIA Research has hundreds of scientists and engineers worldwide, with teams focused on topics including AI, computer graphics, computer vision, self-driving cars and robotics.

They\u2019ll increasingly become two-way, flexible and distributed networks with solar and wind farms connecting homes and buildings that sport solar panels, batteries and electric vehicle chargers.\nIt\u2019s a big job that requires autonomous control systems that process and analyze in real time a massive amount of data \u2014 work well suited to AI and accelerated computing.\nAI is being applied to use cases across electric grids, thanks to a wide ecosystem of companies using NVIDIA\u2019s technologies.\nIn a recent GTC session, utility vendor Hubbell and startup Utilidata, a member of the NVIDIA Inception program, described a new generation of smart meters using the NVIDIA Jetson platform that utilities will deploy to process and analyze real-time grid data using AI models at the edge. Deloitte announced today its support for the effort.\nSiemens Energy detailed in a separate GTC session its work with AI and NVIDIA Omniverse creating digital twins of transformers in substations to improve predictive maintenance, boosting grid resilience. And a video reports on how Siemens Gamesa used Omniverse and accelerated computing to optimize turbine placements for a large wind farm.\n\u201cDeploying AI and advanced computing technologies developed by NVIDIA enables faster and better grid modernization and we, in turn, can deliver for our customers,\u201d said Maria Pope, CEO of Portland General Electric in Oregon.\nNVIDIA Delivers 45,000x Gain in Energy Efficiency\nThe advances come as NVIDIA drives down the costs and energy needed to deploy AI.\nOver the last eight years, NVIDIA increased energy efficiency of running AI inference on state-of-the-art large language models a whopping 45,000x, Huang said in his recent keynote at COMPUTEX.\nNVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs will provide 20x greater energy efficiency than CPUs for AI and high-performance computing. If all CPU servers for these jobs transitioned to GPUs, users would save 37 terawatt-hours a year, the equivalent of 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and the electricity use of 5 million homes.\nThat\u2019s why NVIDIA-powered systems swept the top six spots and took seven of the top 10 in the latest ranking of the Green500, a list of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient supercomputers.\nIn addition, a recent report calls for governments to accelerate adoption of AI as a significant new tool to drive energy efficiency across many industries. It cited examples of utilities adopting AI to make the electric grid more efficient.\nLearn more about how utilities are deploying AI and accelerated computing to improve operations, saving cost and energy.\nWatch the full conversation with Huang below.\n\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Digital Twin | Energy | Events | Inception | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Jetson | Omniverse | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Experience the fun of strategic boss fights through 4-player co-op, using an extensive range of unique characters, with exciting gunplay, and looting. Battle through the engrossing story, and tackle World Missions against huge bosses in The First Descendant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen The First Descendant launches July 2nd, it will feature out of the box support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, and several ray traced effects, ensuring GeForce RTX gamers receive the definitive experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDLSS Super Resolution enables all GeForce RTX users to accelerate frame rates, while DLSS Frame Generation gives GeForce RTX 40 Series users the power of frame rate multiplication, for even faster performance. Our most recent advancement, DLSS 3.5, introduces Ray Reconstruction, a new AI model that creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.\nThis enhanced AI-powered neural renderer improves ray-traced image quality for all GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrained with 5X more data than DLSS 3, using offline-rendered images that require far more computational power than can be delivered during a real-time game, DLSS 3.5 recognizes different ray-traced effects to make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling.

Five years and more than 500 NVIDIA RTX-accelerated apps and games later, it\u2019s bringing AI to even more creators with an array of new RTX technology integrations announced this week at COMPUTEX 2024.\n\nNewly announced NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI laptops \u2014 including the ASUS ProArt PX13 and P16 and MSI Stealth 16 AI+ laptops \u2014 will feature dedicated RTX Tensor Cores to accelerate AI performance and power-efficient systems-on-a-chip with Windows 11 AI PC features. They join over 200 laptops already accelerated with RTX AI technology.\nNVIDIA RTX Video, a collection of technologies including RTX Video Super Resolution and RTX Video HDR that enhance video content streamed in browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox, is coming to the free VLC Media Player. And for the first time in June, creators can enjoy these AI-enhanced video effects in popular creative apps like DaVinci Resolve and Wondershare Filmora.\nDaVinci Resolve and Cyberlink PowerDirector are adding NVIDIA\u2019s new H.265 Ultra-High-Quality (UHQ) mode, which uses the NVIDIA NVENC to increase high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) and encoding efficiency by 10%.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix, a modding platform for remastering classic games with RTX, will soon be made open source, allowing more modders to streamline how assets are replaced and scenes are relit. RTX Remix will also be made accessible via a new REST application programming interface (API) to connect the platform to other modding tools like Blender and Hammer.\nCreative apps are continuing to adopt AI-powered NVIDIA DLSS for higher-quality ray-traced visuals in the viewport, with 3D modeling platform Womp being the latest to integrate DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction.\nNVIDIA unveiled Project G-Assist, an RTX-powered AI-assistant technology demo that provides context-aware help for PC games and apps.\nThe new NVIDIA app beta update adds 120 frames per second AV1 video capture and one-click performance-tuning.\nAnd the latest Game Ready Driver and NVIDIA Studio Driver are available for installation today.\nVideo Gets the AI Treatment\nRTX Video is a collection of real-time, AI-based video enhancements \u2014 powered by RTX GPUs equipped with AI Tensor Cores \u2014 to dramatically improve video quality.\n\nIt includes RTX Video Super Resolution \u2014 an upscaling technology that removes compression artifacts and generates additional pixels to improve video sharpness and clarity up to 4K \u2014 and RTX Video HDR, which transforms standard dynamic range videos into stunning high-dynamic range on HDR10 displays.\n\nNVIDIA has released the RTX Video software development kit, which allows app developers to add RTX Video effects to creator workflows.\nBlackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve, a powerful video editing app with color correction, visual effects,\u00a0graphics and audio post-production capabilities, will be one of the first to integrate RTX Video. The integration is being demoed on the COMPUTEX show floor.\n\nWondershare Filmora, a video editing app with AI tools and pro-level social media video editing features, will support RTX Video HDR, coming soon.\nWondershare Filmora will soon support RTX Video HDR.\nVLC Media Player \u2014 an open-source, cross-platform media player, has added RTX Video HDR in its latest beta release, following its recently added support for Mozilla Firefox.\nNVIDIA hardware encoders deliver a generational boost in encoding efficiency to HEVC. Performance tested on dual Xeon Gold-6140@2.3GHz running NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs with driver 520.65.\nNVIDIA also released a new UHQ mode in NVENC, a dedicated hardware encoder on RTX GPUs, for the HEVC video compression standard (also known as H.265). The new mode increases compression by 10% without diminishing quality, making NVENC HEVC 34% more efficient than the typically used x264 Medium compression standard.\nDaVinci Resolve and Cyberlink PowerDirector video editing software will be adding support for the new UHQ mode in their next updates. Stay tuned for official launch dates.\nRTX Remix Open Sources Creator Toolkit\nNVIDIA RTX Remix allows modders to easily capture game assets, automatically enhance materials with generative AI tools and create stunning RTX remasters with full ray tracing.\nRTX Remix open beta recently added DLSS 3.5 support featuring Ray Reconstruction, an AI model that creates higher-quality images for intensive ray-traced games and apps.\nLater this month, NVIDIA will make the RTX Remix Toolkit open source, allowing more modders to streamline how assets are replaced and scenes are relit. The company is also increasing the supported file formats for RTX Remix\u2019s asset ingestor and bolstering RTX Remix\u2019s AI Texture Tools with new models.\nThe RTX Remix toolkit is now completely open source.\nNVIDIA is also making the capabilities of RTX Remix accessible via a new powerful REST API, allowing modders to livelink RTX Remix to other DCC tools such as Blender and modding tools such as Hammer. NVIDIA is also providing an SDK for the RTX Remix runtime to allow modders to deploy RTX Remix\u2019s renderer into other applications and games beyond DirectX 8 and 9 classics.\nCatch Some Rays\nNVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction enhances ray-traced image quality on NVIDIA RTX and GeForce RTX GPUs by replacing hand-tuned denoisers with an NVIDIA supercomputer-trained AI network that generates higher-quality pixels in between sampled rays.\nPreviewing content in the viewport, even with high-end hardware, can sometimes offer less-than-ideal image quality, as traditional denoisers require hand-tuning for every scene. With DLSS 3.5, the AI neural network recognizes a wide variety of scenes, producing high-quality preview images and drastically reducing time spent rendering.\nThe free browser-based 3D modeling platform Womp has added DLSS 3.5 to enhance interactive, photorealistic modeling in the viewport.\nDLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction unlocks sharper visuals in the viewport.\nChaos Vantage and D5 Render, two popular professional-grade 3D apps that feature real-time preview modes with ray tracing, have also seen drastic performance increases with DLSS 3.5 \u2014 up to a 60% boost from Ray Reconstruction and 4x from all DLSS technologies.\nTools That Accelerate AI Apps\nThe vast ecosystem of open-source AI models currently available are usually pretrained for general purposes and run in data centers.\nTo create more effective app-specific AI tools that run on local PCs, NVIDIA has introduced the RTX AI Toolkit \u2014 an end-to-end workflow for the customization, optimization and deployment of AI models on RTX AI PCs.\nPartners such as Adobe, Topaz and Blackmagic Design are integrating RTX AI Toolkit within their popular creative apps to accelerate AI performance on RTX PCs.\nDevelopers can learn more on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\n\n\nCategories: Pro GraphicsTags: 3D | AI Decoded | Art | Artificial Intelligence | Creators | GeForce | In the NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA RTX | NVIDIA Studio | NVIDIA Studio Driver | Rendering \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA NIM dramatically increases developer productivity by providing a simple, standardized way to add generative AI to their applications.\nNIM also enables enterprises to maximize their infrastructure investments. For example, running Meta Llama 3-8B in a NIM produces up to 3x more generative AI tokens on accelerated infrastructure than without NIM. This lets enterprises boost efficiency and use the same amount of compute infrastructure to generate more responses.\nNearly 200 technology partners \u2014 including Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, DataStax, NetApp, Scale AI and Synopsys \u2014 are integrating NIM into their platforms to speed generative AI deployments for domain-specific applications, such as copilots, code assistants and digital human avatars. Hugging Face is now offering NIM \u2014 starting with Meta Llama 3.\n\u201cEvery enterprise is looking to add generative AI to its operations, but not every enterprise has a dedicated team of AI researchers,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cIntegrated into platforms everywhere, accessible to developers everywhere, running everywhere \u2014 NVIDIA NIM is helping the technology industry put generative AI in reach for every organization.\u201d\nEnterprises can deploy AI applications in production with NIM through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. Starting next month, members of the NVIDIA Developer Program can access NIM for free for research, development and testing on their preferred infrastructure.\n40+ NIM Microservices Power Gen AI Models Across Modalities\r\nNIM containers are pre-built to speed model deployment for GPU-accelerated inference and can include NVIDIA CUDA\u00ae software, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server\u2122 and NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122-LLM software.\nOver 40 NVIDIA and community models are available to experience as NIM endpoints on ai.nvidia.com, including Databricks DBRX, Google\u2019s open model Gemma, Meta Llama 3, Microsoft Phi-3, Mistral Large, Mixtral 8x22B and Snowflake Arctic.\nDevelopers can now access NVIDIA NIM microservices for Meta Llama 3 models from the Hugging Face AI platform. This lets developers easily access and run the Llama 3 NIM in just a few clicks using Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, powered by NVIDIA GPUs on their preferred cloud.\nEnterprises can use NIM to run applications for generating text, images and video, speech and digital humans. With NVIDIA BioNeMo\u2122 NIM microservices for digital biology, researchers can build novel protein structures to accelerate drug discovery.\nDozens of healthcare companies are deploying NIM to power generative AI inference across a range of applications, including surgical planning, digital assistants, drug discovery and clinical trial optimization.\nWith new NVIDIA ACE NIM microservices, developers can easily build and operate interactive, lifelike digital humans in applications for customer service, telehealth, education, gaming and entertainment.\nHundreds of AI Ecosystem Partners Embedding NIM \r\nPlatform providers including Canonical, Red Hat, Nutanix and VMware (acquired by Broadcom) are supporting NIM on open-source KServe or enterprise solutions. AI application companies Hippocratic AI, Glean, Kinetica and Redis are also deploying NIM to power generative AI inference.\nLeading AI tools and MLOps partners \u2014 including Amazon SageMaker, Microsoft Azure AI, Dataiku, DataRobot, deepset, Domino Data Lab, LangChain, Llama Index, Replicate, Run.ai, Saturn Cloud, Securiti AI and Weights & Biases \u2014 have also embedded NIM into their platforms to enable developers to build and deploy domain-specific generative AI applications with optimized inference.\nGlobal system integrators and service delivery partners Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, Latentview, Quantiphi, SoftServe, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro have created NIM competencies to help the world\u2019s enterprises quickly develop and deploy production AI strategies.\nEnterprises can run NIM-enabled applications virtually anywhere, including on NVIDIA-Certified Systems\u2122 from global infrastructure manufacturers Cisco, Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro, as well as server manufacturers ASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE, Ingrasys, Inventec, Pegatron, QCT, Wistron and Wiwynn. NIM microservices have also been integrated into Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.\nTitans of Industry Amp Up Generative AI With NIM\r\nIndustry leaders Foxconn, Pegatron, Amdocs, Lowe\u2019s, ServiceNow and Siemens are among the businesses using NIM for generative AI applications in manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, retail, customer service and more:\n\nFoxconn \u2014 the world\u2019s largest electronics manufacturer \u2014 is using NIM in the development of domain-specific LLMs embedded into a variety of internal systems and processes in its AI factories for smart manufacturing, smart cities and smart electric vehicles.\nPegatron \u2014 a Taiwanese electronics manufacturing company \u2014 is leveraging NIM for Project TaME, a Taiwan Mixtral of Experts model designed to advance the development of local LLMs for industries.\nAmdocs \u2014 a leading global provider of software and services to communications and media companies \u2014 is using NIM to run a customer billing LLM that significantly lowers the cost of tokens, improves accuracy by up to 30% and reduces latency by 80%, driving near real-time responses.\nLowe\u2019s \u2014 a FORTUNE\u00ae 50 home improvement company \u2014 is using generative AI for a variety of use cases. For example, the retailer is leveraging NVIDIA NIM inference microservices to elevate experiences for associates and customers.\nServiceNow \u2014 the AI platform for business transformation \u2014 announced earlier this year that it was one of the first platform providers to access NIM to enable fast, scalable and more cost-effective LLM development and deployment for its customers. NIM microservices are integrated within the Now AI multimodal model and are available to customers that have ServiceNow\u2019s generative AI experience, Now Assist, installed.\nSiemens \u2014 a global technology company focused on industry, infrastructure, transport and healthcare \u2014 is integrating its operational technology with NIM microservices for shop floor AI workloads. It is also building an on-premises version of its Industrial Copilot for Machine Operators using NIM.\n\nAvailability\r\nDevelopers can experiment with NVIDIA microservices at ai.nvidia.com at no charge.

They\u2019re also optimized for inference with the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library.\nNemotron-4 340B can be downloaded now from the NVIDIA NGC catalog and from Hugging Face, where developers can also use the Train on DGX Cloud service to easily fine-tune open AI models. Developers will soon be able to access the models at ai.nvidia.com, where they\u2019ll be packaged as an NVIDIA NIM microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere.\nNavigating Nemotron to Generate Synthetic Data\nLLMs can help developers generate synthetic training data in scenarios where access to large, diverse labeled datasets is limited.\nThe Nemotron-4 340B Instruct model creates diverse synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data, helping improve data quality to increase the performance and robustness of custom LLMs across various domains.\nThen, to boost the quality of the AI-generated data, developers can use the Nemotron-4 340B Reward model to filter for high-quality responses. Nemotron-4 340B Reward grades responses on five attributes: helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity and verbosity. It\u2019s currently first place on the Hugging Face RewardBench leaderboard, created by AI2, for evaluating the capabilities, safety and pitfalls of reward models.\nIn this synthetic data generation pipeline, (1) the Nemotron-4 340B Instruct model is first used to produce synthetic text-based output. An evaluator model, (2) Nemotron-4 340B Reward, then assesses this generated text \u2014 providing feedback that guides iterative improvements and ensures the synthetic data is accurate, relevant and aligned with specific requirements.\nResearchers can also create their own instruct or reward models by customizing the Nemotron-4 340B Base model using their proprietary data, combined with the included HelpSteer2 dataset.\nFine-Tuning With NeMo, Optimizing for Inference With TensorRT-LLM\nUsing open-source NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, developers can optimize the efficiency of their instruct and reward models to generate synthetic data and to score responses.\nAll Nemotron-4 340B models are optimized with TensorRT-LLM to take advantage of tensor parallelism, a type of model parallelism in which individual weight matrices are split across multiple GPUs and servers, enabling efficient inference at scale.\nNemotron-4 340B Base, trained on 9 trillion tokens, can be customized using the NeMo framework to adapt to specific use cases or domains. This fine-tuning process benefits from extensive pretraining data and yields more accurate outputs for specific downstream tasks.\nA variety of customization methods are available through the NeMo framework, including supervised fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as low-rank adaptation, or LoRA.\nTo boost model quality, developers can align their models with NeMo Aligner and datasets annotated by Nemotron-4 340B Reward. Alignment is a key step in training LLMs, where a model\u2019s behavior is fine-tuned using algorithms like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to ensure its outputs are safe, accurate, contextually appropriate and consistent with its intended goals.\nBusinesses seeking enterprise-grade support and security for production environments can also access NeMo and TensorRT-LLM through the cloud-native NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which provides accelerated and efficient runtimes for generative AI foundation models.\nEvaluating Model Security and Getting Started\nThe Nemotron-4 340B Instruct model underwent extensive safety evaluation, including adversarial tests, and performed well across a wide range of risk indicators. Users should still perform careful evaluation of the model\u2019s outputs to ensure the synthetically generated data is suitable, safe and accurate for their use case.\nFor more information on model security and safety evaluation, read the model card.\nDownload Nemotron-4 340B models via NVIDIA NGC and Hugging Face. For more details, read the research papers on the model and dataset.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Synthetic Data Generation | TensorRT \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Everything that moves will one day be autonomous,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cWe are working to accelerate generative physical AI by advancing the NVIDIA robotics stack, including Omniverse for simulation applications, Project GR00T humanoid foundation models and the Jetson Thor robotics computer.\u201d\nThe Isaac platform features a suite of NVIDIA-accelerated libraries, AI foundation models and simulation technologies that are available today to robot makers to integrate into their technology stacks.\n\nNVIDIA Isaac ROS \u2014 a collection of modular ROS 2 packages that brings NVIDIA-acceleration and AI models to ROS community developers.\nNVIDIA Isaac Perceptor \u2014 a reference workflow built on Isaac ROS that provides multi-camera, 3D surround-vision capabilities for AI-based autonomous mobile robots.\nNVIDIA Isaac Manipulator \u2014 a reference workflow built on Isaac ROS that simplifies development of AI-enabled robot arms, or manipulators, that can seamlessly perceive, understand and interact with their environments.\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122\u00a0\u2014 a reference application for simulating, testing and validating robots in physically based environments, and for generating synthetic data, based on the NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform.\nNVIDIA Isaac Lab \u2014 a reference application in Isaac Sim optimized for reinforcement, imitation and transfer learning for AI robot foundation model training.\n\nIsaac Ecosystem Rapidly Expands\r\nNVIDIA Isaac\u2019s early adopters are leaders in robotics and autonomous machine development across Asia, Europe and North America.\nSiemens, global leader in industrial automation software and systems, is using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for its powerful software-in-the-loop capabilities. The Isaac technologies accelerate Siemens development and testing of advanced robotics skills such as SIMATIC Robot PickAI (PRO) and SIMATIC Robot Pack AI. The AI vision software provides cognitive AI-driven capabilities and enables industrial robot systems to autonomously and reliably pick-and-pack arbitrary items without any prior training of the AI by the user. The companies plan to expand their partnership and announce new capabilities later this year at the SPS Expo.\nSiemens delivers industrial-grade AI and is pushing it to the forefront of robotics by seamlessly integrating with automation solutions and making it easy to use when deployed on a NVIDIA-powered Siemens industrial PC foundation, bringing vision AI to the ecosystem of industrial robots.\n\u201cAI-powered robots will accelerate the digital transformation of industry and take over repetitive tasks that were previously impossible to automate so we can unlock human potential for more creative and valuable work,\u201d said Roland Busch, president and CEO at Siemens AG. \u201cTogether with NVIDIA, Siemens is empowering our customers and partners to use AI to create new innovations, incorporate them as part of their industrial automation solutions and drive efficiency and competitive advantage.\u201d\nIntrinsic, a software and AI robotics subsidiary of Alphabet that acquired the Open Source Robotics Corporation in late 2022, has successfully tested Isaac Manipulator in its robot-agnostic software platform. Intrinsic has demonstrated, using Manipulator, the potential for a scalable, universally applicable robotic-grasping skill to work across grippers, environments and objects.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have found a better collaborator in NVIDIA, who are helping to pave the way for foundation models to have a profound impact on industrial robotics,\u201d said Wendy Tan White, CEO of Intrinsic. \u201cAs our teams work together on integrating NVIDIA Isaac and Intrinsic\u2019s platform, the potential value we can unlock for millions of developers and businesses is immense.\u201d\nBYD Group has a strong manufacturing footprint across four major industries, including electronics, automotive, new energy and rail transportation worldwide. Its one subsidiary, BYD Electronics (BYDE), a global leading provider of high-tech and innovative products, is developing a full range of autonomous mobile robots that provide factories with complete logistics solutions using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Perceptor.\n\u201cBYDE has a strong focus on helping customers accelerate deployment of logistics applications,\u201d said Chris Yotive, senior business development director of BYD Electronics. \u201cIn collaboration with NVIDIA, we have developed advanced autonomous mobile robots powered by NVIDIA Isaac that will improve worker safety, reduce production costs and enhance production intelligence for our customers.\u201d\nUniversal Robots (UR) and Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR), Teradyne Robotics companies, are using NVIDIA Isaac to integrate AI into automation. UR is integrating Isaac Manipulator into its PolyScope X software platform to unlock new cobot solutions. MiR is leveraging Isaac Sim to generate synthetic data and simulate its MiR1200 Pallet Jack for real-world deployments.\n\u201cThe key to tackling our customers\u2019 challenges in robotics lies in the industry\u2019s ability to work together, in one collective effort,\u201d said Ujjwal Kumar, group president of Teradyne Robotics. \u201cWith NVIDIA Isaac\u2019s advanced AI and simulation capabilities plugged into our large installed base of autonomous mobile robots and cobots, we will push the envelope of innovation to achieve swift solutions for multiple industries.\u201d\nThe NVIDIA Isaac platform is modular, enabling companies to adopt individual or several technologies together.\nCompanies leveraging Isaac Perceptor for development of advanced perception-based autonomous mobile robots include: ArcBest, BYD Electronics, Gideon, idealworks and RGo Robotics.\nCompanies leveraging Isaac Manipulator for building AI-based robotic arms include: Solomon, Techman Robot, Vention and Yaskawa.\nOver 100 companies are adopting Isaac Sim to simulate, test and validate robotic applications, including Hexagon, Husqvarna Group and MathWorks.

Our initial beta release in February was the first step in our journey to modernize and unify the NVIDIA Control Panel, GeForce Experience and RTX Experience, and on June 4th at 3am PT we\u2019re launching a new update with new features.\nAvailable for download via the in-app updater, and from our website, the new NVIDIA app beta update adds 120 FPS AV1 video capture, introduces one-click GPU performance tuning, enhances the NVIDIA app overlay, and further refines the user experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you're a gaming enthusiast or a content creator, the NVIDIA app simplifies the process of keeping your PC updated with the latest GeForce Game Ready and NVIDIA Studio drivers, and enables quick discovery and installation of NVIDIA applications like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA Broadcast and NVIDIA Omniverse.\nFeaturing a unified GPU control center, NVIDIA app allows fine-tuning of game and driver settings from a single place, while introducing a redesigned in-game overlay for convenient access to powerful gameplay recording tools, performance monitoring overlays, automatic SDR to HDR conversion in games, and game enhancing filters, including innovative new AI-powered filters for GeForce RTX users.\nRead on to learn more about the new NVIDIA app features, and what\u2019s coming next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120 FPS AV1 Recording Enhances Your Videos\nIn the new NVIDIA app beta update, we\u2019ve introduced support for AV1 SDR and HDR video encoding, greatly improving the clarity and quality of recordings.\nUtilizing the eighth-generation NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC) on GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards and laptop GPUs, AV1 improves encoding efficiency by 40%, producing higher quality videos without requiring more disk space.\nFor gamers recording each multiplayer match and single-player walkthroughs, disk space savings are substantial, and if you save footage to the same drive your game is loaded from, the difference can ease any Input/Output-related stutters and accelerate loading times.\nNew with this release, the NVIDIA app now gives gamers the option of recording at 120 frames per second, for smoother, more immersive playback. While this option is available for all codecs, GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can record even higher quality captures with AV1 at the same bit rates when compared to H.264.\nTo demonstrate the benefits of AV1, we\u2019ve captured the opening cutscene from Horizon Forbidden West\u2122 Complete Edition using AV1 and H264, at 10 mbps, one of the most commonly used recording and streaming bit rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing AV1, there are fewer blocky artifacts, color banding is reduced, and significantly more detail is preserved in fast motion scenes, better demonstrating the fidelity of Horizon Forbidden West\u2122 Complete Edition with maxed out PC settings and DLSS 3 Frame Generation.\nTo increase the quality of your recordings, open the NVIDIA app, click Settings on the left nav, and enable the NVIDIA overlay if it isn\u2019t already activated. Press the shortcut shown on-screen (Alt+Z by default), click the Settings cog icon at the top of the new panel that appears, click \u201cVideo Capture\u201d, select AV1 under \u201cCodec\u201d, and change other settings as you see fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to record PC tutorials or other out-of-game content, enable the \u201cDesktop capture\u201d option. Using \u201cInstant Replay length\u201d you can define the amount of recordings to continually save when gaming. This is great for ensuring you can always record hilarious and breathtaking moments. To enable, press Alt+Shift+F10, then press Alt+F10 in-game to save the last X minutes of gameplay.\nAlternatively, you can press Alt+F9 to continuously record until you exit the game or press Alt+F9 again; if you simply want a screenshot, press Alt+F1.\nFor a rundown of other features in the NVIDIA app beta, head here. There are many, including in-game system stats, image enhancing and altering filters, automatic high-quality HDR, AI filters, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Panel & One-Click Automatic GPU Tuning\nOwners of GeForce RTX desktop graphics cards and laptops can monitor and maximize the potential of their GPUs with the Performance Panel and one-click automatic GPU tuning. This returning feature scans your system performance characteristics and offers one-click automatic GPU tuning, optimizing your GPU\u2019s performance. Additionally, the automatic GPU Tuner also performs regular checkup scans on your GPU to ensure you continue to have the best tuning profile.\nTo access these performance features,\u00a0 open the new System section on NVIDIA app\u2019s left nav, click over to the Performance tab and initiate Automatic Tuning. Our app will then test your GPU\u2019s capabilities over the course of 10-20 minutes, during which time we recommend letting your system idle, otherwise results may be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower users may also adjust voltage, power, temperature and fan speed targets, which will change the parameters used by our advanced tuning algorithms. This is useful, for instance, if you wish to maximize performance without going above a certain temperature threshold, or want fans to spin at 70% max.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-Game Overlay Updates\nOur In-Game Overlay has undergone a comprehensive redesign in the first beta, and in this update, we have improved the user interface for Photo Mode, improving the way you can add filters for your photos. Furthermore, we've simplified the process to exit the overlay - Instead of pressing \"escape,\" you can also now simply click outside of the menu to close it. We\u2019ve also added GPU power in the Statistics section, enabling you to track usage in-game and in the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Reward: PC Game Pass\nNVIDIA app users get access to rewards, such as in-game content, exclusive GeForce NOW premium membership offers, and more. Simply start the NVIDIA app and visit the Redeem tab to check out the latest rewards.\nStarting June 4th at 6am PT, we\u2019re giving gamers 3 months of access to PC Game Pass, for free!

Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d said Huang. \u201cFrom server, networking and infrastructure manufacturers to software developers, the whole industry is gearing up for Blackwell to accelerate AI-powered innovation for every field.\u201d\nTo address applications of all types, the offerings will range from single to multi-GPUs, x86- to Grace-based processors, and air- to liquid-cooling technology.\nAdditionally, to speed up the development of systems of different sizes and configurations, the NVIDIA MGX\u2122 modular reference design platform now supports NVIDIA Blackwell products. This includes the new NVIDIA GB200 NVL2 platform, built to deliver unparalleled performance for mainstream large language model inference, retrieval-augmented generation and data processing.\nGB200 NVL2 is ideally suited for emerging market opportunities such as data analytics, on which companies spend tens of billions of dollars annually. Taking advantage of high-bandwidth memory performance provided by NVLink\u00ae-C2C interconnects and dedicated decompression engines in the Blackwell architecture speeds up data processing by up to 18x, with 8x better energy efficiency compared to using x86 CPUs.\nModular Reference Architecture for Accelerated Computing\r\nTo meet the diverse accelerated computing needs of the world\u2019s data centers, NVIDIA MGX provides computer manufacturers with a reference architecture to quickly and cost-effectively build more than 100 system design configurations.\nManufacturers start with a basic system architecture for their server chassis, and then select their GPU, DPU and CPU to address different workloads. To date, more than 90 systems from over 25 partners have been released or are in development that leverage the MGX reference architecture, up from 14 systems from six partners last year. Using MGX can help slash development costs by up to three-quarters and reduce development time by two-thirds, to just six months.\nAMD and Intel are supporting the MGX architecture with plans to deliver, for the first time, their own CPU host processor module designs. This includes the next-generation AMD Turin platform and the Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 6 processor with P-cores (formerly codenamed Granite Rapids). Any server system builder can use these reference designs to save development time while ensuring consistency in design and performance.\nNVIDIA\u2019s latest platform, the GB200 NVL2, also leverages MGX and Blackwell. Its scale-out, single-node design enables a wide variety of system configurations and networking options to seamlessly integrate accelerated computing into existing data center infrastructure.\nThe GB200 NVL2 joins the Blackwell product lineup, which also includes NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs, GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips and the GB200 NVL72.\nAn Ecosystem Unites\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s comprehensive partner ecosystem includes TSMC, the world\u2019s leading semiconductor manufacturer and an NVIDIA foundry partner, as well as global electronics makers, which provide key components to create AI factories. These include manufacturing innovations such as server racks, power delivery, cooling solutions and more from companies such as Amphenol, Asia Vital Components (AVC), Cooler Master, Colder Products Company (CPC), Danfoss, Delta Electronics and LITEON.\nAs a result, new data center infrastructure can quickly be developed and deployed to meet the needs of the world\u2019s enterprises \u2014 and further accelerated by Blackwell technology, NVIDIA Quantum-2 or Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking, NVIDIA Spectrum\u2122-X Ethernet networking and NVIDIA BlueField\u00ae-3 DPUs \u2014 in servers from leading systems makers Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo.\nEnterprises can also access the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes NVIDIA NIM\u2122 inference microservices, to create and run production-grade generative AI applications.\nTaiwan Embraces Blackwell\r\nHuang also announced during his keynote that Taiwan's leading companies are rapidly adopting Blackwell to bring the power of AI to their own businesses.\nTaiwan\u2019s leading medical center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, plans to use the NVIDIA Blackwell computing platform to advance biomedical research and accelerate imaging and language applications to improve clinical workflows, ultimately enhancing patient care.\nFoxconn, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of electronics, is planning to use NVIDIA Grace Blackwell to develop smart solution platforms for AI-powered electric vehicle and robotics platforms, as well as a growing number of language-based generative AI services to provide more personalized experiences to its customers.\nAdditional Supporting Quotes\n\nR.

Many of us spend hours scouring the internet for assistance to learn and master our favorite titles. The amount of knowledge available is immense, spanning millions of guides and countless words.\nProject G-Assist aims to put game and system knowledge at players\u2019 fingertips. Simply ask a question about your game or system performance, and the AI assistant provides context-aware answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Gaming AI Assistants Work\nProject G-Assist takes voice or text inputs from the player, along with a snapshot of what\u2019s in the game window. The snapshot is fed into AI vision models that provide context awareness and app-specific understanding for the Large Language Model (LLM), which is connected to a database of game knowledge such as a wiki. The output of the LLM is an insightful and personalized response\u2014either text, or speech from the AI \u2014based on what\u2019s happening in-game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG-Assist\u2019s vision and language models can be customized by developers for a specific game or app, providing a high degree of accuracy and insightfulness.\nThese custom AI models can then be run on the cloud, or are locally accelerated by GeForce RTX AI PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject G-Assist Gaming Demo, Featuring ARK: Survival Ascended\nTo demonstrate what\u2019s possible with Project G-Assist, we\u2019ve partnered with Studio Wildcard for a tech demonstration using ARK: Survival Ascended, their Unreal Engine 5, open-world, dinosaur-filled survival game.\nActivated by pressing a hotkey, or using a wake phrase, the AI Assistant can help players with questions they often find themselves looking up online: whether it\u2019s about quests, items, lore, or difficult to tackle bosses. In ARK: Survival Ascended, it may suggest the best early game weapon and where to find the necessary materials to craft it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging AI vision models to understand what is happening in the game window, the AI Assistant can advise whether an on-screen dinosaur should be avoided, or different approaches to taming a particular beast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, because the assistant is context aware, it can personalize its recommendations to the user\u2019s playthrough: it can analyze skill points, the crafting menu and currently locked engrams, for example, and suggest what to pick next to help players conquer higher-level areas and foes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you wish to learn more about a particular answer, context-sensitive links can direct you to additional information online, from the official ARK wiki in this instance.\nIn an RPG or level-based game, the assistant could hint at the location of secret items and missable lore, before giving you step by step instructions to some or all, if asked. In an RTS, it could share the recommended early game build order, or resource management strategies to help you get on level terms with long-time players. And in an FPS, you could instantly discover the current loadout meta, along with all recommended attachments, leveling the field and ensuring you\u2019re not at a competitive disadvantage.\nThese are just a few of many possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject G-Assist Performance Tuning\nModern games demand peak performance from our systems for smooth, immersive gameplay. But determining the best PC and game settings for your specific setup often isn\u2019t straightforward, and can require a ton of time-intensive tweaking and testing.\nProject G-Assist can also be extremely useful in performance tuning. To demonstrate, let\u2019s check out a GeForce RTX PC playing CD PROJEKT RED\u2019s critically-acclaimed game, Cyberpunk 2077.\nWith a simple prompt, Project G-Assist can evaluate your system\u2019s configuration and performance, and instantly tune it for an optimal experience. Apply NVIDIA app\u2019s optimized game settings, based on extensive testing on thousands of hardware configurations; enable Performance Tuning to apply a safe GPU overclock; switch on NVIDIA Reflex to reduce system latency for more responsive gaming; plus so much more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI Assistant can track and graph frame rates, power usage, PC latency, and other hardware statistics, suggesting ways to improve them when prompted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can intelligently find ways to increase performance per watt, such as dynamically undervolting the GPU while respecting a frame rate target. For laptop users, power usage is of particular importance, determining how long they can play before their battery is depleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are dozens of game and hardware settings spread between game menus, apps and control panels. The AI Assistant can scan your system to see if there\u2019s anything out of order, such as not taking full advantage of your display\u2019s resolution, refresh rate, or other capabilities, including HDR and G-SYNC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can also describe what settings do, and what the expected impact on performance is. For instance, it can explain the difference between DLAA and DLSS, and between Ultra Low Latency Mode in the NVIDIA Control Panel and NVIDIA Reflex in-game.\nThese questions and more can be quickly answered with AI Assistants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject G-Assist: A Glimpse Into The Future\nWe envision AI assistants transforming the way we engage with our favorite games and apps. Imagine getting instant context-aware assistance with a complex creative workflow in a photo or video app. Or an AI coach analyzing your multiplayer replays, teaching you strategies to move up the ranks in competitive matches. Project G-Assist is a glimpse into that future.\nProject G-Assist won\u2019t play a game for you like we suggested in our prophetic 2017 April Fool\u2019s video, but it can help you get more out of your favorite games, and find help for a troublesome boss. Takeout ordering, however\u2026 we could definitely add that to the roadmap.\nHead over to GeForce.com to learn about our other Computex 2024 announcements, and stay tuned to hear about the AI innovations we\u2019re working on next.

Revealed for the first time, the Rubin platform will succeed the upcoming Blackwell platform, featuring new GPUs, a new Arm-based CPU \u2014 Vera \u2014 and advanced networking with NVLink 6, CX9 SuperNIC and the X1600 converged InfiniBand/Ethernet switch.\n\u201cOur company has a one-year rhythm. Our basic philosophy is very simple: build the entire data center scale, disaggregate and sell to you parts on a one-year rhythm, and push everything to technology limits,\u201d Huang explained.\nNVIDIA\u2019s creative team used AI tools from members of the NVIDIA Inception startup program, built on NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing, to create the COMPUTEX keynote. Packed with demos, this showcase highlighted these innovative tools and the transformative impact of NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\n\u2018Accelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing\u2019\nNVIDIA is driving down the cost of turning data into intelligence, Huang explained as he began his talk.\n\u201cAccelerated computing is sustainable computing,\u201d he emphasized, outlining how the combination of GPUs and CPUs can deliver up to a 100x speedup while only increasing power consumption by a factor of three, achieving 25x more performance per Watt over CPUs alone.\n\u201cThe more you buy, the more you save,\u201d Huang noted, highlighting this approach\u2019s significant cost and energy savings.\nIndustry Joins NVIDIA to Build AI Factories to Power New Industrial Revolution\nLeading computer manufacturers, particularly from Taiwan, the global IT hub, have embraced NVIDIA GPUs and networking solutions. Top companies include ASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE, Ingrasys, Inventec, Pegatron, QCT, Supermicro, Wistron and Wiwynn, which are creating cloud, on-premises and edge AI systems.\nThe NVIDIA MGX modular reference design platform now supports Blackwell, including the GB200 NVL2 platform, designed for optimal performance in large language model inference, retrieval-augmented generation and data processing.\nAMD and Intel are supporting the MGX architecture with plans to deliver, for the first time, their own CPU host processor module designs. Any server system builder can use these reference designs to save development time while ensuring consistency in design and performance.\nNext-Generation Networking with Spectrum-X\nIn networking, Huang unveiled plans for the annual release of Spectrum-X products to cater to the growing demand for high-performance Ethernet networking for AI.\nNVIDIA Spectrum-X, the first Ethernet fabric built for AI, enhances network performance by 1.6x more than traditional Ethernet fabrics. It accelerates the processing, analysis and execution of AI workloads and, in turn, the development and deployment of AI solutions.\nCoreWeave, GMO Internet Group, Lambda, Scaleway, STPX Global and Yotta are among the first AI cloud service providers embracing Spectrum-X to bring extreme networking performance to their AI infrastructures.\nNVIDIA NIM to Transform Millions Into Gen AI Developers\nWith NVIDIA NIM, the world\u2019s 28 million developers can now easily create generative AI applications. NIM \u2014 inference microservices that provide models as optimized containers \u2014 can be deployed on clouds, data centers or workstations.\nNIM also enables enterprises to maximize their infrastructure investments. For example, running Meta Llama 3-8B in a NIM produces up to 3x more generative AI tokens on accelerated infrastructure than without NIM.\n\nNearly 200 technology partners \u2014 including Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, DataStax, NetApp, Scale AI, and Synopsys \u2014 are integrating NIM into their platforms to speed generative AI deployments for domain-specific applications, such as copilots, code assistants, digital human avatars and more. Hugging Face is now offering NIM \u2014 starting with Meta Llama 3.\n\u201cToday we just posted up in Hugging Face the Llama 3 fully optimized, it\u2019s available there for you to try. You can even take it with you,\u201d Huang said. \u201cSo you could run it in the cloud, run it in any cloud, download this container, put it into your own data center, and you can host it to make it available for your customers.\u201d\nNVIDIA Brings AI Assistants to Life With GeForce RTX AI PCs\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX AI PCs, powered by RTX technologies, are set to revolutionize consumer experiences with over 200 RTX AI laptops and more than 500 AI-powered apps and games.\nThe RTX AI Toolkit and newly available PC-based NIM inference microservices for the NVIDIA ACE digital human platform underscore NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to AI accessibility.\nProject G-Assist, an RTX-powered AI assistant technology demo, was also announced, showcasing context-aware assistance for PC games and apps.\nAnd Microsoft and NVIDIA are collaborating to help developers bring new generative AI capabilities to their Windows native and web apps with easy API access to RTX-accelerated SLMs that enable RAG capabilities that run on-device as part of Windows Copilot Runtime.\n\nNVIDIA Robotics Adopted by Industry Leaders\nNVIDIA is spearheading the $50 trillion industrial digitization shift, with sectors embracing autonomous operations and digital twins \u2014 virtual models that enhance efficiency and cut costs. Through its Developer Program, NVIDIA offers access to NIM, fostering AI innovation.\nTaiwanese manufacturers are transforming their factories using NVIDIA\u2019s technology, with Huang showcasing Foxconn\u2019s use of NVIDIA Omniverse, Isaac and Metropolis to create digital twins, combining vision AI and robot development tools for enhanced robotic facilities.\n\u201cThe next wave of AI is physical AI. AI that understands the laws of physics, AI that can work among us,\u201d Huang said, emphasizing the importance of robotics and AI in future developments.\nThe NVIDIA Isaac platform provides a robust toolkit for developers to build AI robots, including AMRs, industrial arms and humanoids, powered by AI models and supercomputers like Jetson Orin and Thor.\n\u201cRobotics is here. Physical AI is here. This is not science fiction, and it\u2019s being used all over Taiwan. It\u2019s just really, really exciting,\u201d Huang added.\n\nGlobal electronics giants are integrating NVIDIA\u2019s autonomous robotics into their factories, leveraging simulation in Omniverse to test and validate this new wave of AI for the physical world. This includes over 5 million preprogrammed robots worldwide.\n\u201cAll the factories will be robotic. The factories will orchestrate robots, and those robots will be building products that are robotic,\u201d Huang explained.\nHuang emphasized NVIDIA Isaac\u2019s role in boosting factory and warehouse efficiency, with global leaders like BYD Electronics, Siemens, Teradyne Robotics and Intrinsic adopting its advanced libraries and AI models.\nNVIDIA AI Enterprise on the IGX platform, with partners like ADLINK, Advantech and ONYX, delivers edge AI solutions meeting strict regulatory standards, essential for medical technology and other industries.\nHuang ended his keynote on the same note he began it on, paying tribute to Taiwan and NVIDIA\u2019s many partners there. \u201cThank you,\u201d Huang said. \u201cI love you guys.\u201d\n\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | Data Center | Driving | Gaming | Generative AITags: COMPUTEX 2024 | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It extended a breathtakingly rapid climb that started last year, powered by bets that the US firm is positioned to be a major winner from a wave of investment in artificial intelligence (AI).Its market value now sits just behind Microsoft, another key player in the industry thanks to its investments in Chat GPT-maker OpenAI.Valued at \"just\" $2tn as recently as February, Nvidia sparked a new wave of share purchases after it announced plans last month for a so-called stock split.The move will increase the number of shares by a factor of 10 and reduce their value accordingly, a change aimed at making shares more affordable to small-time investors.Set to happen on Friday, it is expected to generate even more demand for the stock. Founded in 1993, Nvidia was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games.Long before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning - all of which has helped it increase its market share.It is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world, a shift boss Jensen Huang has declared the dawn of the \"next industrial revolution\".His company has seen explosive growth, reporting sales of $26bn in the three months to 28 April - more than triple the same period in 2023, and up 18% from the previous three month.Optimism about AI is one of the forces behind a broader market rally over the last year, which pushed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq in the United States to new records on Wednesday. Apple had appeared to be losing out earlier this year as sales growth stalled.But in recent weeks, its shares have been buoyed by anticipation over how it plans to incorporate AI into its own strategy.Shares in the firm rose 0.7%, giving it a market capitalisation of roughly $3tn, which is generally calculated by multiplying the number of shares in a company by its current share price.Nvidia unveils latest artificial intelligence chipNvidia boss sees AI 'tipping point' as sales soarNvidiaRelatedNvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fears27 Feb 2025US tech stocks steady after DeepSeek AI app shock28 Jan 2025BusinessNvidia unveils robot ambitions and powerful new gaming chips7 Jan 2025BusinessBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

The Project G-Assist tech demo debuted with ARK: Survival Ascended from Studio Wildcard. NVIDIA also introduced the first PC-based NVIDIA NIM\u2122 inference microservices for the NVIDIA ACE digital human platform.\nThese technologies are enabled by the NVIDIA RTX AI Toolkit, a new suite of tools and software development kits that aid developers in optimizing and deploying large generative AI models on Windows PCs. They join NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack RTX AI innovations accelerating over 500 PC applications and games and 200 laptop designs from manufacturers.\nIn addition, newly announced RTX AI PC laptops from ASUS and MSI feature up to GeForce RTX 4070 GPUs and power-efficient systems-on-a-chip with Windows 11 AI PC capabilities. These Windows 11 AI PCs will receive a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available.\n\u201cNVIDIA launched the era of AI PCs in 2018 with the release of RTX Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA DLSS,\u201d said Jason Paul, vice president of consumer AI at NVIDIA. \u201cNow, with Project G-Assist and NVIDIA ACE, we\u2019re unlocking the next generation of AI-powered experiences for over 100 million RTX AI PC users.\u201d\nProject G-Assist, a GeForce AI Assistant\r\nAI assistants are set to transform gaming and in-app experiences \u2014 from offering gaming strategies and analyzing multiplayer replays to assisting with complex creative workflows. Project G-Assist is a glimpse into this future.\nPC games offer vast universes to explore and intricate mechanics to master, which are challenging and time-consuming feats even for the most dedicated gamers. Project G-Assist aims to put game knowledge at players\u2019 fingertips using generative AI.\nProject G-Assist takes voice or text inputs from the player, along with contextual information from the game screen, and runs the data through AI vision models. These models enhance the contextual awareness and app-specific understanding of a large language model (LLM) linked to a game knowledge database, and then generate a tailored response delivered as text or speech.\nNVIDIA partnered with Studio Wildcard to demo the technology with ARK: Survival Ascended. Project G-Assist can help answer questions about creatures, items, lore, objectives, difficult bosses and more. Because Project G-Assist is context-aware, it personalizes its responses to the player\u2019s game session.\nIn addition, Project G-Assist can configure the player\u2019s gaming system for optimal performance and efficiency. It can provide insights into performance metrics, optimize graphics settings depending on the user\u2019s hardware, apply a safe overclock and even intelligently reduce power consumption while maintaining a performance target.\nFirst ACE PC NIM Debuts\nNVIDIA ACE technology for powering digital humans is now coming to RTX AI PCs and workstations with NVIDIA NIM \u2014 inference microservices that enable developers to reduce deployment times from weeks to minutes. ACE NIM microservices deliver high-quality inference running locally on devices for natural language understanding, speech synthesis, facial animation and more.\nAt COMPUTEX, the gaming debut of NVIDIA ACE NIM on the PC will be featured in the Covert Protocol tech demo, developed in collaboration with Inworld AI. It now showcases NVIDIA Audio2Face\u2122 and NVIDIA Riva automatic speech recognition running locally on devices.\nWindows Copilot Runtime to Add GPU Acceleration for Local PC SLMs\r\nMicrosoft and NVIDIA are collaborating to help developers bring new generative AI capabilities to their Windows native and web apps. This collaboration will provide application developers with easy application programming interface (API) access to GPU-accelerated small language models (SLMs) that enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities that run on-device as part of Windows Copilot Runtime.\nSLMs provide tremendous possibilities for Windows developers, including content summarization, content generation and task automation. RAG capabilities augment SLMs by giving the AI models access to domain-specific information not well represented in \u200cbase models. RAG APIs enable developers to harness application-specific data sources and tune SLM behavior and capabilities to application needs.\nThese AI capabilities will be accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs, as well as AI accelerators from other hardware vendors, providing end users with fast, responsive AI experiences across the breadth of the Windows ecosystem.\nThe API will be released in developer preview later this year.\n4x Faster, 3x Smaller Models With the RTX AI Toolkit\r\nThe AI ecosystem has built hundreds of thousands of open-source models for app developers to leverage, but most models are pretrained for general purposes and built to run in a data center.\nTo help developers build application-specific AI models that run on PCs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX AI Toolkit \u2014 a suite of tools and SDKs for model customization, optimization and deployment on RTX AI PCs. RTX AI Toolkit will be available later this month for broader developer access.\nDevelopers can customize a pretrained model with open-source QLoRa tools. Then, they can use the NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122 model optimizer to quantize models to consume up to 3x less RAM. NVIDIA TensorRT Cloud then optimizes the model for peak performance across the RTX GPU lineups. The result is up to 4x faster performance compared with the pretrained model.\nThe new\u00a0NVIDIA AI Inference Manager\u00a0SDK,\u00a0now available in early access, simplifies the deployment of ACE to PCs. It preconfigures the PC with the necessary AI models, engines and dependencies while orchestrating AI inference seamlessly across PCs and the cloud.\nSoftware partners such as Adobe, Blackmagic Design and Topaz are integrating components of the RTX AI Toolkit within their popular creative apps to accelerate AI performance on RTX PCs.\n\u201cAdobe and NVIDIA continue to collaborate to deliver breakthrough customer experiences across all creative workflows, from video to imaging, design, 3D and beyond,\u201d said Deepa Subramaniam, vice president of product marketing, Creative Cloud at Adobe. \u201cTensorRT 10.0 on RTX PCs delivers unprecedented performance and AI-powered capabilities for creators, designers and developers, unlocking new creative possibilities for content creation in industry-leading creative tools like Photoshop.\u201d\nComponents of the RTX AI Toolkit, such as TensorRT-LLM, are integrated in popular developer frameworks and applications for generative AI, including Automatic1111, ComfyUI, Jan.AI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Oobabooga and Sanctum.AI.\nAI for Content Creation\r\nNVIDIA is also integrating RTX AI acceleration into apps for creators, modders and video enthusiasts.\nLast year, NVIDIA introduced RTX acceleration using TensorRT for one of the most popular Stable Diffusion user interfaces, Automatic1111. Starting this week, RTX will also accelerate the highly popular ComfyUI, delivering up to a 60% improvement in performance over the currently shipping version, and 7x faster performance compared with the MacBook Pro M3 Max.\nNVIDIA RTX Remix is a modding platform for remastering classic DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and physically accurate materials. RTX Remix includes a runtime renderer and the RTX Remix Toolkit app, which facilitates the modding of game assets and materials.\nLast year, NVIDIA made RTX Remix Runtime open source, allowing modders to expand game compatibility and advance rendering capabilities.\nSince RTX Remix Toolkit launched earlier this year, 20,000 modders have used it to mod classic games, resulting in over 100 RTX remasters in development on the RTX Remix Showcase Discord.\nThis month, NVIDIA will make the RTX Remix Toolkit open source, allowing modders to streamline how assets are replaced and scenes are relit, increase supported file formats for RTX Remix\u2019s asset ingestor and bolster RTX Remix\u2019s AI Texture Tools with new models.\nIn addition, NVIDIA is making the capabilities of RTX Remix Toolkit accessible via a REST API, allowing modders to livelink RTX Remix to digital content creation tools such as Blender, modding tools such as Hammer and generative AI apps such as ComfyUI. NVIDIA is also providing an SDK for RTX Remix Runtime to allow modders to deploy RTX Remix\u2019s renderer into other applications and games beyond DirectX 8 and 9 classics.\nWith more of the RTX Remix platform being made open source, modders across the globe can build even more stunning RTX remasters.\nNVIDIA RTX Video, the popular AI-powered super-resolution feature supported in the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers, is now available as an SDK to all developers, helping them natively integrate AI for upscaling, sharpening, compression artifact reduction and high-dynamic range (HDR) conversion.\nComing soon to video editing software Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve and Wondershare Filmora, RTX Video will enable video editors to upscale lower-quality video files to 4K resolution, as well as convert standard dynamic range source files into HDR. In addition, the free media player VLC media will soon add RTX Video HDR to its existing super-resolution capability.\nLearn more about RTX AI PCs and technology by joining NVIDIA at COMPUTEX.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0technology,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a0AI laptops, Project G-Assist, NVIDIA\u00a0NIM\u00a0inference\u00a0microservices, NVIDIA ACE digital human platform, NVIDIA\u00a0RTX\u00a0AI Toolkit,\u00a0GeForce\u00a0RTX\u00a04070\u00a0GPUs,\u00a0RTX\u00a0Tensor Core GPUs, DLSS, NVIDIA Audio2Face, NVIDIA Riva, NVIDIA\u00a0TensorRT, NVIDIA AI Inference Manager, NVIDIA RTX Remix, NVIDIA DLSS 3.5,\u00a0RTX\u00a0Remix Runtime, and NVIDIA RTX Video; the benefits and impact of NVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with third parties, and the features and availability of their services and offerings; third parties using or adopting NVIDIA\u2019s products or technologies and the benefits thereof; RAG\u00a0APIs\u00a0enabling developers to harness application-specific data sources and tune SLM behavior and capabilities to application needs; and NVIDIA unlocking the next generation of AI-powered experiences for over 100 million\u00a0RTX\u00a0AI PC users, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

He\u2019s obviously enjoying the moment.\"His new-found status, complete with an embossed $9,000 Tom Ford biker jacket, was on display this week at Computex in Taiwan - the annual tech conference draws the world's biggest companies to the island.   Mr Huang, who was born in Taiwan but left when he was just five years old, posed for countless pictures and even scrawled his name on a woman's top at the conference, wondering aloud if this was a \"good idea\". It was, in the words of local media, pure \"Jensanity\".This comes as US regulators are reportedly planning to open an investigation into big tech, including Nvidia, over its dominance over the AI industry. The interest Mr Huang has stirred has not been lost on his peers - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, responding to a social media follower who did not know who Mr Huang was, described him as \u201cTaylor Swift, but for tech\u201d.What is driving the 'Jensanity'?Mr Huang is at the forefront of a technology boom, and his rise has coincided with Nvidia's emergence as the leading designer of AI chips.Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC is the sole production partner for Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge AI chips. And Nvidia's success has been a boost for TSMC, whose shares hit a record high on Thursday.High-end chips, including those used for AI, have become a source of geopolitcial tension as the US and China race to master production. But it's Taiwan that currently sits at the top of that game - it makes nearly all of the world's most advanced chips.  All of this has generated a lot of buzz around Mr Huang and the company he founded decades ago. His success is also a matter of pride for Taiwan, a self-ruled island which Beijing claims. As those claims have become more aggressive, Taiwan's chip exports have both become a lifeline and a tool of soft power. \"In Taiwan, he\u2019s also the local boy done good. That is something people can rally around,\" Mr O'Donnell said. Although he lives in Santa Clara in California where Nvidia is headquartered, Mr Huang frequently visits Taiwan. He has always emphasised that Nvidia would continue investing in the island. Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen HuangJust this week, he told reporters that the company plans to build regional headquarters in Taiwan, which is welcome news for the island. It has been concerned about chip production moving overseas as manufacturers look for alternative supply routes that would be safe in case of a Chinese invasion.     And of course, there is the success of Nvidia itself. Shares have gone up by more than 200% over the last year. The secret sauce for Taiwan's chip superstardomThe firm has been catapulted into tech stardom as AI and the chips that power it become as cool as any fancy new gadget. Mr Huang knows this well. He has been fronting Nvidia's chip launches and they have been likened to massively-watched Apple events. In Taiwan, where he launched new products, he spoke for two hours about the company's history. \u201cNvidia\u2019s last big conference in San Jose was in a stadium. It was jam-packed and huge lines of people couldn\u2019t get in. It was like a rock concert,\u201d Mr O\u2019Donnell said.\u201cThis time, he spoke in a sports stadium in Taiwan. I joked that he was on his arena tour.\u201dWhat do we know about Jensen Huang?For one, Mr Huang loves his leather jackets. He credits his wife and daughter for making it his signature style. A spokesperson from Nvidia says he been wearing one for more than two decades now. His latest pick from Tom Ford is from the fashion house's 2023 season - and he has kept it on even during visits to humid Singapore.\u201cLeather jackets can signal an edge: a willingness to break rules, do things differently and challenge the status quo,\u201d says fashion stylist Sera Murphy.\u201cJensen\u2019s signature style gives him a casual, approachable energy,\u201d she adds.Signature styles are not uncommon among tech CEOs. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was known for the outfit he wore all the time - black St. Croix mock turtleneck sweater, blue Levi's 501 jeans, and New Balance 991 trainers. Mr Zuckerberg is usually in plain sweaters and t-shirts from luxury fashion brands. Mark ZuckerbergMark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang swapped jackets in March \u201cUniform dressing\u201d can help entrepreneurs create an image of stability around their companies, Ms Murphy says. \u201cPeople need consistency from leaders. Dressing in a uniform makes things predictable in a market that is volatile and unpredictable.\" His leather jacket aside, Mr Huang fits the description of a tech geek. He was nine years old when his family moved to the West Coast in the US. He graduated as an electrical engineer from Oregon State University, and then with a masters degree in the same field from Stanford University. He married his college sweetheart and lab partner, Lori Mills, also an electrical engineer. The couple have two children. He worked at US chip firm AMD before co-founding Nvidia in 1993. The company was originally known for chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games. Eventually it changed focus to AI, a field it now dominates.Getty ImagesJensen Huang with his family (L-R) - his daughter Madison, wife Lori and son SpencerInterest in AI skyrocketed after the 2022 launch of ChatGPT. The chatbot was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), clustered together in a supercomputer.This propelled Nvidia to the elite club of US companies worth at least $1tn last May, joining the likes of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. Nvidia is now the world's third-most valuable company, after Microsoft and Apple. Mr Huang himself has a net worth of around $106bn, according to Forbes, making him the 14th richest person in the world. Mr O\u2019Donnell says Mr Huang is likely to keep appearing at events, seeking to drum up Nvidia's brand. \u201cAt technology conferences, everyone wants Jensen on stage and he\u2019s happy to join. What he has done makes him appear everywhere. He\u2019s positioned himself as the figurehead of generative AI,\u201d Mr O\u2019Donnell says.\u201cThe issue is the industry does not like monopolies. Nvidia has a huge market share, but competitors like AMD and Intel are starting to catch up.\"International BusinessArtificial intelligenceAsiaNvidiaSemiconductorsTaiwanRelatedThe Matrix film producer files for bankruptcy12 hrs agoBusinessSubsea fibre cables can 'listen out' for sabotage18 hrs agoTechnologyDisasters spur investment in flood and fire risk tech19 hrs agoMore6 hrs agoCurfew in India city after violence over Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tombPolice in Nagpur city say the situation is now under control and are asking people to maintain peace.6 hrs agoAsia10 hrs ago'Discarded like a dirty rag': Chinese state media hails Trump's cuts to Voice of AmericaState newspaper gloated that the network has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\". 10 hrs agoWorld12 hrs agoJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cryHerbie Hancock on 80 years of playing the piano and being this year's recipient of the Polar Music Prize.12 hrs agoCulture15 hrs agoJury discharged in high-profile Australia beach murderRajwinder Singh, who is accused of murdering Toyah Cordingley in 2018, is likely to face another trial.15 hrs agoWorld19 hrs agoWhy is China spending billions to get people to open their wallets?Beijing hopes better wages and discounts can encourage spending and stave off greater economic trouble.19 hrs agoAsiaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

The company's share price has jumped more than 170 percent this year.In May, Nvidia reported revenues of $26 billion, up 262 percent over the same time last year. Data center-specific revenue hit $22.6bn, up 427 percent over last year and up 23 percent over the last quarter.\"The next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with Nvidia to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's founder and CEO, at the time.\u201cOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\"Nvidia also forecast total revenue of $28bn plus or minus two percent for the current quarter, above analyst expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore in The Investment & Markets Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Data Center Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26 Feb 2025\n\n\n\n\nQuantum Machines raises $170m in oversubscribed funding round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\nHow regulation is impacting the data center investment landscape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nNvidia\n\n\nJensen Huang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitepapers  More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing data center efficiency: A smarter approach to PUE with DCIM\n\n\n18 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Data Centers: Scaling Up and Scaling Out\n\n\n13 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay cool: DDC eases the risk in embracing the AI future\n\n\n12 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Phase Liquid Cooling Offers a New Model for Cooling Next-Gen Servers\n\n\n10 Mar 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream Now: Next generation computing environments for AI workloads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                    Thank you!

The artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader held its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, six years after the company was founded. In honor of Nvidia stock turning 25 years old earlier this year, below are 25 reasons -- in no particular order -- to buy it.\nAs background, Nvidia has four market platforms: data center, gaming, professional visualization, and auto & robotics. Data center is its largest (accounting for 87% of revenue in its most recent quarter) and fastest growing due to surging adoption of AI, particularly generative AI. Generative AI exploded onto the scene in late 2022 with the release of the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\n1. Company is run by a founder\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang was one of the company's three co-founders. Studies show that stocks of founder-led companies tend to outperform others over the long term.\n2. Founder-CEO has much skin in the game\nHuang owns about 868 million shares of Nvidia stock following Friday's 10-for-1 stock split (discussed in No. 6), as of the most recent available data. This stake is worth about $105 billion, as of the stock's closing price on June 7. Given this massive stake, investors can be sure Huang's interest is aligned with their interests. \n3. CFO's huge stock holdings suggest much confidence in Nvidia's future\nCFO Colette Kress owns 6.43 million shares of Nvidia stock following Friday's 10-for-1 stock split (discussed in No. 6). These shares were worth about $777 million, as of June 7. A CFO probably has the best handle of everyone in a company -- including its CEO -- on its financial performance at any given time. So, it seems safe to say that Kress is very optimistic about Nvidia's growth prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Nvidia stock's longer-term performance is phenomenal\nOver the last 10 years, Nvidia stock has returned 25,431% through June 7. That's more than 100 times the S&P 500 index's return of 230%. Put another way, a $1,000 investment in Nvidia stock a decade ago would now be worth more than $250,000.\nA stock's past performance is no guarantee of its future performance. However, a stock's long-term performance often reflects the ability of a company's top management to establish and implement successful strategies.\n5. AI market is projected to continue to grow briskly\nIn 2024, the global AI market is projected to reach revenue of $184 billion, and have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.5% through 2030, when it will be worth an estimated $826.7 billion, according to Statista. \nThis is a huge positive for Nvidia, whose graphics processing unit (GPU) chips and related products and services are used for training and deploying AI applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split just occured on June 7\nOn Friday, June 7, Nvidia stock split 10-for-1. Investors who owned the stock as of the day before received nine additional shares for each share they owned. The stock is scheduled to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Monday, June 10.\nOn Friday, Nvidia stock's closing price was $1,208.88, which means that its split-adjusted price was $120.89.\nPotential benefits for investors of Nvidia's stock split include a boost in price from greater demand for shares, and a higher chance at being included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.\n7. The company dominates the data center AI chip market\nIt's widely estimated that Nvidia has more than a 90% share of the market for AI GPU chips for data centers, and more than an 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market. \n\n\n\n\n\n8. Data center AI chip market is projected to continue to grow like gangbusters\nIn 2023, the global market for chips to accelerate AI processing in data centers was worth about $45 billion, according to an estimate by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.70%) CEO Lisa Su. She projects this market will reach $400 billion in revenue by 2027, which equates to a blistering CAGR of 72.7%.\n9. Nvidia's data center business has strong competitive advantages\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel have recently entered Nvidia's turf -- AI-enabling GPUs for data centers. Investors shouldn't be overly concerned. Nvidia's competitive advantages don't only stem from its GPUs, but also its software, particularly CUDA, which has been used by millions of developers for many years. CUDA enables its GPUs to possess the parallel processing capabilities needed for accelerating general and AI computing.\n10. Its revenue is growing rapidly\nNvidia's year-over-year revenue growth over the last four quarters starting with the most recent quarter: 262%, 265%, 206%, and 101%. \n11. Its profits are increasing even faster than revenue \nNvidia's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are growing faster than its revenue, which reflects its expanding profit margins. This dynamic is being driven by its highly profitable data center business growing faster than its other businesses. Here's the company's year-over-year adjusted EPS growth over the last four quarters starting with the most recent quarter: 461%, 486%, 593%, and 429%.\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Its free cash flow is also growing rapidly\nNvidia's year-over-year free cash flow (FCF) growth over the last four quarters starting with the most recent quarter: 465%, 546%, N/A (FCF was negative in year-ago period), and 634%.\n13. Wall Street expects strong profit growth over the next 5 years\nAs of June 7, Wall Street projects that Nvidia will grow adjusted EPS at an average annual rate of 46.5% over the next five years.\n14. Nvidia nearly always beats Wall Street's expectations\nNvidia nearly always beats Wall Street's quarterly earnings estimates -- and oftentimes, by a lot. In the prior four quarters, the company's adjusted EPS has exceeded the analyst consensus estimate by percentages ranging from 10% to 29%.\nIf this dynamic continues, Nvidia's CAGR over the next five years will be higher than the 46.5% that analysts now expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. The stock's valuation is reasonable\nAt Friday's closing price, Nvidia stock is priced at 44.6 times forward estimated earnings. In a vacuum, this is a high valuation. But it's reasonable for a company that Wall Street expects to grow adjusted EPS 109% this fiscal year and at an average annual rate of 46.5% over the next five years. Moreover, analysts are likely underestimating its growth potential, as covered above.\n16. It's much more profitable than its main competitors and peers\n\n\n\nCompany\nGAAP Profit Margin (TTM)\n\n\nNvidia\n53.4%\n\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n4.9%\n\n\nIntel\n7.4%\n\n\nQualcomm\n23%\n\n\nBroadcom\n29.9%\n\n\n\nList is not all-inclusive. Data sources: YCharts and finviz.com. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles. TTM= trailing 12 months.\n17. It's reportedly forming a custom chip business unit\nSources have reported and signs suggest that Nvidia is forming a custom chip business unit so that it can capture some of the custom chip development work for big tech companies that currently goes to chipmakers such as Broadcom. The new unit will reportedly help companies design custom chips for AI and other applications.\n18. It's the largest supplier of graphics cards for gaming\nGaming is Nvidia's second largest market platform, accounting for 10% of its revenue in its most recent quarter. The company is the world's largest supplier of graphics cards for computer gaming. In the first quarter of 2024, it had an 88% share of the desktop discrete GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research. AMD and Intel had a 12% and less than 1% share, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n19. PC gaming market is projected to continue its solid growth\nIn 2023, the global personal computer (PC) gaming market generated about $80.3 billion in revenue, according to Statista, which projects this market will be worth $141.9 billion in 2028. That equates to a CAGR of about 12.1%. \n20. Nvidia generates some recurring revenue\nNvidia has relatively recently begun launching software and service offerings that generate recurring revenue. In February, CFO Kress said that in fiscal Q4 the company's software and services offerings reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion. \n21. Its revenue should get a big boost when driverless vehicles become legal\nNvidia's revenue should get a big boost when driverless vehicles become legal across the U.S. and world. Hundreds of vehicle manufacturers, tier 1 suppliers, and others are developing on the company's autonomous vehicle AI computing platform, DRIVE.\nWhen Nvidia's partners use its DRIVE platform in production vehicles, they need to buy a DRIVE AI computer for each vehicle. Its big-name partners include luxury vehicle maker Mercedes-Benz and electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD. \n\n\n\n\n\n22. Its sovereign AI business has multibillion-dollar potential\nNations and other sovereign entities have relatively recently begun using Nvidia's technology to build their own sovereign AI cloud services. The \"sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next few years,\" CFO Kress said last November on the company's fiscal Q3 2024 earnings call. \n23. It just ramped up its robotics initiatives\nIn March, Nvidia introduced it Project GR00T (Generalist Robot 00 Technology) AI foundation model for humanoid robots and major updates to its Isaac robotics platform.\n24. Its balance sheet is in solid shape\nAt the end of the last quarter, Nvidia had cash and cash equivalents of $7.6 billion and long-term debt of $8.5 billion.\n25. Employes really like working for Nvidia\nOn Glassdoor.com, Nvidia employees and former employees give the company an overall rating of 4.6 stars (on a scale of 1 to 5), as of June 7. Employee satisfaction is particularly important for companies in the technology realm, as there is a limited amount of top tech talent. Nvidia's rating is the highest of all the so-called Big Tech companies. \n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Nvidia's stock price rose about 3.5%, eclipsing $135 per share and giving the chipmaker a market capitalization over $3.33 trillion. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at nearly $3.32 trillion.  Shares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 175%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024. Nvidia first crossed a $1 trillion market cap on June 13, 2023. The stock advanced north of $2 trillion on March 1, and then rapidly crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time on June 5. The company's advance from a $1 trillion to a $3 trillion market cap was the fastest on record.   Nvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index hitting record highs in 2024. Up until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team. Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10.  NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.91 -2.62 (-2.19%)  As of 3:01:03 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA MSFT   Advanced Chart    The company's rise comes amid the generative AI explosion that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT platform in late 2022. Nvidia's chips, modified graphics cards, and CUDA software platform are designed to both train and run AI programs, giving it a strategic advantage that experts say will take rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) years to overcome. Nvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software. Tech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.  During a keynote at the Computex conference in Taiwan on June 2, CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip \u2014 called the Blackwell Ultra \u2014 in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.   Story Continues Nvidia's data center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. But AMD and Intel are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.Intel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.Nvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.

Will tougher rules hurt the entire ecosystem?https://p.dw.com/p/4h7ArUS antitrust bodies are to probe the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boomImage: VCG/MAXPPP/- und Matthias Balkdpa/picture alliance, AdvertisementMicrosoft and Nvidia have quickly taken prime positions in the\u00a0artificial intelligence revolution.\u00a0The tech giants\u00a0have\u00a0a combined market value of $6.6 trillion (\u20ac6.16 trillion), making them\u00a0two of the\u00a0three largest companies in the world.\u00a0\nMicrosoft's recent success has been underpinned by\u00a0its $13 billion bet on\u00a0OpenAI, the startup behind the ChatGPT chatbot, while\u00a0Nvidia\u00a0can boast the world's most\u00a0\u00a0advanced chips that are vital to running high-end AI systems.\nBut their good fortune means\u00a0competition authorities in the\u00a0United States are circling.\u00a0Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reached a deal on how to investigate\u00a0the two firms' dominant position in the AI space.\nThe FTC is set to focus on the close relationship between Microsoft and Open AI, whose parent company\u00a0is a non-profit. The DOJ will, meanwhile,\u00a0lead the investigation into Nvidia's competitive edge. The chipmaker\u00a0has around 80% of the AI semiconductor\u00a0market and is now\u00a0valued at\u00a0$3.32 trillion, up from just $364 billion two years ago.\n\"Big Tech has gained too much power in the last 15 years or so, and regulators have been asleep at the wheel,\" Simonetta Vezzoso, a lawyer and economist from Italy's Trento University, told DW. \"Now they worry that they might be replaying the same game with AI and want to avoid that.\"Is ChatGPT4o omnipotent? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSmaller players depend on Big Tech\nStartups need large amounts of data, storage and chip capacity to be able to train their AI chatbots, which is where regulators believe the tech giants hold too much power. There is some evidence that smaller players are being forced\u00a0into exclusive, opaque deals to run technology from Nvidia,\u00a0Microsoft and their rivals, which\u00a0can give the already dominant players an even bigger advantage.\n\"The competition authorities\u00a0want to protect innovation coming from startups. These deals come with a lot of strings attached, so Big Tech could be hampering that competition,\" Vezzoso added.\nDOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter told an AI conference at Stanford University in California earlier this month that \"powerful network effects may enable dominant firms to control these new [AI] markets.\"\nRecent mergers likely to be probed\nMicrosoft's $650 million acquisition of Inflection AI,\u00a0the startup behind the Pi personal assistant app,\u00a0in March also raised eyebrows\u00a0as the deal may have been designed to avoid merger disclosure rules.\n\"Microsoft bought Inflection without buying it,\" Pedro Domingos,\u00a0professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, told DW. \"They broke it into pieces, hired most of their staffers and paid off\u00a0the investors.\"\nSome policymakers believe the lack of scrutiny over earlier\u00a0mergers\u00a0saw Big Tech acquire\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0startups\u00a0that could have gone much further\u00a0to disrupt the tech sector,\u00a0so their probes will also focus on the impact on innovation.Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan says she wants startups to have \"a fair shot at competing\"Image: Drew Angerer /Getty Images via AFP\nVezzoso said that to remedy their past mistakes, antitrust regulators are keen to act more quickly and\u00a0\"reverse the burden of proof\" from themselves to the tech giants. If necessary, she\u00a0called for \"very resolute measures on Big Tech.\"\n\"I would like to see them [regulators] be very assertive.\u00a0If a\u00a0big tech firm\u00a0wants\u00a0to buy a small startup, they should have to show that there is no anti-competitive issue,\" said Vezzoso, who is also\u00a0an external consultant for the human rights group Article 19.\nImpossible to read the future?\nDomingos, on the other hand, thinks it's \"comical\" to launch antitrust lawsuits \"not about harms that have been done, but about those that might happen\u00a0in the future.\"\nThe author of the book \"The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World\" noted how Meta CEO\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said that Instagram would not be\u00a0the success it\u00a0is today if Facebook hadn't bought it.\n\"Facebook gave [Instagram]\u00a0a huge amount of infrastructure and expertise\u00a0that they didn't have.\u00a0If you fast forward, you can apply the same reasoning to Microsoft and Nvidia\u00a0and the AI startups that they may be buying,\" Domingos added.How does an AI chatbot work? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUS regulators team up\nUS President Joe Biden vowed again this year to make scrutiny of Big Tech a priority for his administration and some legal experts have\u00a0spotted a more collaborative approach from the FTC and the DOJ in cracking down\u00a0on Silicon Valley's business practices.\u00a0\n\"It used to be that the agencies divided the cases according to industry, but with this market being so large and important for antitrust enforcement, they are sharing responsibility and working hand-in-glove,\"\u00a0Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, told The Guardian recently.\nAs the US presidential election approaches, just a short window of opportunity may remain for the Biden administration\u00a0to take action, which could still be undone if Donald Trump\u00a0wins the White House in November.Open AI is expected to release ChatGPT 5 \u2014 the latest version of its chatbot \u2014 this summerImage: Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/Sipa USA/picture alliance \nTech giants face growing resentment\nDomingos, meanwhile, noted how\u00a0federal and state lawmakers have introduced nearly a thousand laws to regulate AI since ChatGPT was first released, noting that some policymakers have \"a lot of hostility towards the big tech companies and want to use AI as a tool to attack them with.\"\nThe additional scrutiny is already having a chilling effect on the tech sector, where the big tech giants are growing increasingly scared of acquiring promising startups.\nMerger and acquisitions hit a multiyear low last year in terms of deal value, falling below $300 billion, according to\u00a0451 Research. In 2022, the value of all buyouts was nearly $800 billion. The large strategic tech players\u00a0such as\u00a0Meta, Salesforce, Alphabet,\u00a0Apple\u00a0and Amazon\u00a0made just 4 acquisitions last year, compared to 18 a year earlier, data from\u00a0Capital IQ Pro shows.\n\"The big tech companies are now afraid to do acquisitions, which is damaging to the ecosystem because\u00a0for a lot of startups \u2014 their fate in life is to be acquired\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and everybody benefits,\"\u00a0Domingos told DW.\nEdited by: Ashutosh Pandey\nNik Martin is one of DW's team of business reporters based in Bonn.Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisementSkip next section Explore moreExplore moreHow well do AI chatbots understand us?

The partnership was announced on 3 June at Snowflake Summit 2024 by CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy and Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang and will see Nvidia\u2019s AI enterprise software integrated into Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI LLM.  Pairing Nvidia\u2019s full stack accelerated computing and software with Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI LLM will enable customers from every industry and every skill level to build custom AI applications based on their enterprise data with ease, efficiency and trust, according to Ramaswamy. The announcement continues an existing collaboration between Snowflake and Nvidia to deliver a single, unified AI infrastructure and compute platform in the AI data cloud. Snowflake\u2019s mission to enable enterprises to build foundational models aligns with AI market trends. According to research and analysis company GlobalData\u2019s 2024 AI predictions, organisations will increasingly use smaller, more vertically focused and domain-specific models. Small language models (SLMs) have several advantages over LLMs, including cost savings and the potential to address privacy concerns, according to GlobalData\u2019s thematic intelligence executive briefing on AI. By using self-hosted or smaller models, companies will be able to train the models on their own data, increasing accuracy and relevance as well as increasing efficiency and creating cost savings. In fact, some tasks, including code generation and customer service applications, are particularly suited to SLMs.  Addressing an audience at the Snowflake Summit 2024, Huang outlined a paradigm shift in the way data is processed which is enabled by the Snowflake and Nvidia's collaboration. Enterprise data processing is becoming increasingly complex as volumes grow exponentially. By bringing high performance computing to the data rather than moving data to computing access points saves time and money, according to Huang, who described the shift as \u201cprofound\u201d. AI development is moving so fast that \u201ctime to market is everything,\u201d he added. GlobalData forecasts that the overall AI market will be worth $909bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% between 2022 and 2030. In the generative AI space, revenues are expected to grow from $1.8bn in 2022 to $33bn in 2027 at a CAGR of 80%. \"Snowflake announces partnership with Nvidia to develop enterprise AI\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

In finance, bankers are using AI to detect fraud more quickly and keep accounts safe, telecommunications providers are improving networks to deliver superior service, scientists are developing novel treatments for rare diseases, utility companies are building cleaner, more reliable energy grids and automotive companies are making self-driving cars safer and more accessible.\nThe backbone of top AI use cases is data. Effective and precise AI models require training on extensive datasets. Enterprises seeking to harness the power of AI must establish a data pipeline that involves extracting data from diverse sources, transforming it into a consistent format and storing it efficiently.\nData scientists work to refine datasets through multiple experiments to fine-tune AI models for optimal performance in real-world applications. These applications, from voice assistants to personalized recommendation systems, require rapid processing of large data volumes to deliver real-time performance.\nAs AI models become more complex and begin to handle diverse data types such as text, audio, images, and video, the need for rapid data processing becomes more critical. Organizations that continue to rely on legacy CPU-based computing are struggling with hampered innovation and performance due to data bottlenecks, escalating data center costs, and insufficient computing capabilities.\nMany businesses are turning to accelerated computing to integrate AI into their operations. This method leverages GPUs, specialized hardware, software, and parallel computing techniques to boost computing performance by as much as 150x and increase energy efficiency by up to 42x.\nLeading companies across different sectors are using accelerated data processing to spearhead groundbreaking AI initiatives.\nFinance Organizations Detect Fraud in a Fraction of a Second\nFinancial organizations face a significant challenge in detecting patterns of fraud due to the vast amount of transactional data that requires rapid analysis. Additionally, the scarcity of labeled data for actual instances of fraud poses a difficulty in training AI models. Conventional data science pipelines lack the required acceleration to handle the large data volumes associated with fraud detection. This leads to slower processing times that hinder real-time data analysis and fraud detection capabilities.\nTo overcome these challenges, American Express, which handles more than 8 billion transactions per year, uses accelerated computing to train and deploy long short-term memory (LSTM) models. These models excel in sequential analysis and detection of anomalies, and can adapt and learn from new data, making them ideal for combating fraud.\nLeveraging parallel computing techniques on GPUs, American Express significantly speeds up the training of its LSTM models. GPUs also enable live models to process huge volumes of transactional data to make high-performance computations to detect fraud in real time.\nThe system operates within two milliseconds of latency to better protect customers and merchants, delivering a 50x improvement over a CPU-based configuration. By combining the accelerated LSTM deep neural network with its existing methods, American Express has improved fraud detection accuracy by up to 6% in specific segments.\nFinancial companies can also use accelerated computing to reduce data processing costs. Running data-heavy Spark3 workloads on NVIDIA GPUs, PayPal confirmed the potential to reduce cloud costs by up to 70% for big data processing and AI applications.\nBy processing data more efficiently, financial institutions can detect fraud in real time, enabling faster decision-making without disrupting transaction flow and minimizing the risk of financial loss.\nTelcos Simplify Complex Routing Operations\nTelecommunications providers generate immense amounts of data from various sources, including network devices, customer interactions, billing systems, and network performance and maintenance.\nManaging national networks that handle hundreds of petabytes of data every day requires complex technician routing to ensure service delivery. To optimize technician dispatch, advanced routing engines perform trillions of computations, taking into account factors like weather, technician skills, customer requests and fleet distribution. Success in these operations depends on meticulous data preparation and sufficient computing power.\nAT&T, which operates one of the nation\u2019s largest field dispatch teams to service its customers, is enhancing data-heavy routing operations with NVIDIA cuOpt, which relies on heuristics, metaheuristics and optimizations to calculate complex vehicle routing problems.\nIn early trials, cuOpt delivered routing solutions in 10 seconds, achieving a 90% reduction in cloud costs and enabling technicians to complete more service calls daily. NVIDIA RAPIDS, a suite of software libraries that enables acceleration of data science and analytics pipelines, further accelerates cuOpt, allowing companies to integrate local search heuristics and metaheuristics like Tabu search for continuous route optimization.\nAT&T is adopting NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark to enhance the performance of Spark-based AI and data pipelines. This has helped the company boost operational efficiency on everything from training AI models to maintaining network quality to reducing customer churn and improving fraud detection. With RAPIDS Accelerator, AT&T is reducing its cloud computing spend for target workloads while enabling faster performance and reducing its carbon footprint.\nAccelerated data pipelines and processing will be critical as telcos seek to improve operational efficiency while delivering the highest possible service quality.\nBiomedical Researchers Condense Drug Discovery Timelines\nAs researchers utilize technology to study the roughly 25,000 genes in the human genome to understand their relationship with diseases, there has been an explosion of medical data and peer-reviewed research papers. Biomedical researchers rely on these papers to narrow down the field of study for novel treatments. However, conducting literature reviews of such a massive and expanding body of relevant research has become an impossible task.\nAstraZeneca, a leading pharmaceutical company, developed a Biological Insights Knowledge Graph (BIKG) to aid scientists across the drug discovery process, from literature reviews to screen hit rating, target identification and more. This graph integrates public and internal databases with information from scientific literature, modeling between 10 million and 1 billion complex biological relationships.\nBIKG has been effectively used for gene ranking, aiding scientists in hypothesizing high-potential targets for novel disease treatments. At NVIDIA GTC, the AstraZeneca team presented a project that successfully identified genes linked to resistance in lung cancer treatments.\nTo narrow down potential genes, data scientists and biological researchers collaborated to define the criteria and gene features ideal for targeting in treatment development. They trained a machine learning algorithm to search the BIKG databases for genes with the designated features mentioned in literature as treatable. Utilizing NVIDIA RAPIDS for faster computations, the team reduced the initial gene pool from 3,000 to just 40 target genes, a task that previously took months but now takes mere seconds.\nBy supplementing drug development with accelerated computing and AI, pharmaceutical companies and researchers can finally use the enormous troves of data building up in the medical field to develop novel drugs faster and more safely, ultimately having a life-saving impact.\nUtility Companies Build the Future of Clean Energy\u00a0\nThere\u2019s been a significant push to shift to carbon-neutral energy sources in the energy sector. With the cost of harnessing renewable resources such as solar energy falling drastically over the last 10 years, the opportunity to make real progress toward a clean energy future has never been greater.\nHowever, this shift toward integrating clean energy from wind farms, solar farms and home batteries has introduced new complexities in grid management. As energy infrastructure diversifies and two-way power flows must be accommodated, managing the grid has become more data-intensive. New smart grids are now required to handle high-voltage areas for vehicle charging. They must also manage the availability of distributed stored energy sources and adapt to variations in usage across the network.\nUtilidata, a prominent grid-edge software company, has collaborated with NVIDIA to develop a distributed AI platform, Karman, for the grid edge using a custom NVIDIA Jetson Orin edge AI module. This custom chip and platform, embedded in electricity meters, transforms each meter into a data collection and control point, capable of handling thousands of data points per second.\nKarman processes real-time, high-resolution data from meters at the network\u2019s edge. This enables utility companies to gain detailed insights into grid conditions, predict usage and seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources in seconds, rather than minutes or hours. Additionally, with inference models on edge devices, network operators can anticipate and quickly identify line faults to predict potential outages and conduct preventative maintenance to increase grid reliability.\nThrough the integration of AI and accelerated data analytics, Karman helps utility providers transform existing infrastructure into efficient smart grids. This allows for tailored, localized electricity distribution to meet fluctuating demand patterns without extensive physical infrastructure upgrades, facilitating a more cost-effective modernization of the grid.\nAutomakers Enable Safer, More Accessible, Self-Driving Vehicles\nAs auto companies strive for full self-driving capabilities, vehicles must be able to detect objects and navigate in real time. This requires high-speed data processing tasks, including feeding live data from cameras, lidar, radar and GPS into AI models that make navigation decisions to keep roads safe.\nThe autonomous driving inference workflow is complex and includes multiple AI models along with necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps. Traditionally, these steps were handled on the client side using CPUs. However, this can lead to significant bottlenecks in processing speeds, which is an unacceptable drawback for an application where fast processing equates to safety.\nTo enhance the efficiency of autonomous driving workflows, electric vehicle manufacturer NIO integrated NVIDIA Triton Inference Server into its inference pipeline. NVIDIA Triton is open-source, multi-framework, inference-serving software. By centralizing data processing tasks, NIO reduced latency by 6x in some core areas and increased overall data throughput by up to 5x.\nNIO\u2019s GPU-centric approach made it easier to update and deploy new AI models without the need to change anything on the vehicles themselves. Additionally, the company could use multiple AI models at the same time on the same set of images without having to send data back and forth over a network, which saved on data transfer costs and improved performance.\nBy using accelerated data processing, autonomous vehicle software developers ensure they can reach a high-performance standard to avoid traffic accidents, lower transportation costs and improve mobility for users.\nRetailers Improve Demand Forecasting\nIn the fast-paced retail environment, the ability to process and analyze data quickly is critical to adjusting inventory levels, personalizing customer interactions and optimizing pricing strategies on the fly. The larger a retailer is and the more products it carries, the more complex and compute-intensive its data operations will be.\nWalmart, the largest retailer in the world, turned to accelerated computing to significantly improve forecasting accuracy for 500 million item-by-store combinations across 4,500 stores.\nAs Walmart\u2019s data science team built more robust machine learning algorithms to take on this mammoth forecasting challenge, the existing computing environment began to falter, with jobs failing to complete or generating inaccurate results. The company found that data scientists were having to remove features from algorithms just so they would run to completion.\nTo improve its forecasting operations, Walmart started using NVIDIA GPUs and RAPIDs. The company now uses a forecasting model with 350 data features to predict sales across all product categories. These features encompass sales data, promotional events, and external factors like weather conditions and major events like the Super Bowl, which influence demand.\nAdvanced models helped Walmart improve forecast accuracy from 94% to 97% while eliminating an estimated $100 million in fresh produce waste and reducing stockout and markdown scenarios. GPUs also ran models 100x faster with jobs complete in just four hours, an operation that would\u2019ve taken several weeks in a CPU environment.\nBy shifting data-intensive operations to GPUs and accelerated computing, retailers can lower both their cost and their carbon footprint while delivering best-fit choices and lower prices to shoppers.\nPublic Sector Improves Disaster Preparedness\u00a0\nDrones and satellites capture huge amounts of aerial image data that public and private organizations use to predict weather patterns, track animal migrations and observe environmental changes. This data is invaluable for research and planning, enabling more informed decision-making in fields like agriculture, disaster management and efforts to combat climate change. However, the value of this imagery can be limited if it lacks specific location metadata.\nA federal agency working with NVIDIA needed a way to automatically pinpoint the location of images missing geospatial metadata, which is essential for missions such as search and rescue, responding to natural disasters and monitoring the environment. However, identifying a small area within a larger region using an aerial image without metadata is extremely challenging, akin to locating a needle in a haystack. Algorithms designed to help with geolocation must address variations in image lighting and differences due to images being taken at various times, dates and angles.\nTo identify non-geotagged aerial images, NVIDIA, Booz Allen and the government agency collaborated on a solution that uses computer vision algorithms to extract information from image pixel data to scale the image similarity search problem.\nWhen attempting to solve this problem, an NVIDIA solutions architect first used a Python-based application. Initially running on CPUs, processing took more than 24 hours. GPUs supercharged this to just minutes, performing thousands of data operations in parallel versus only a handful of operations on a CPU. By shifting the application code to CuPy, an open-sourced GPU-accelerated library, the application experienced a remarkable 1.8-million-x speedup, returning results in 67 microseconds.\nWith a solution that can process images and the data of large land masses in just minutes, organizations can gain access to the critical information needed to respond more quickly and effectively to emergencies and plan proactively, potentially saving lives and safeguarding the environment.\nAccelerate AI Initiatives and Deliver Business Results\nCompanies using accelerated computing for data processing are advancing AI initiatives and positioning themselves to innovate and perform at higher levels than their peers.\nAccelerated computing handles larger datasets more efficiently, enables faster model training and selection of optimal algorithms, and facilitates more precise results for live AI solutions.\nEnterprises that use it can achieve superior price-performance ratios compared to traditional CPU-based systems and enhance their ability to deliver outstanding results and experiences to customers, employees and partners.\nLearn how accelerated computing helps organizations achieve AI objectives and drive innovation.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Data Science | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Industrial and Manufacturing | RAPIDS | Social Impact | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia shares had soared in recent times, climbing nearly 600% in just three years. That's as the company once known mainly for serving gaming customers with its chips surged to the forefront in the world of artificial intelligence (AI).\nNvidia designs and sells the world's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), and customers launching AI programs have been rushing to get their hands on them -- and on other Nvidia products and services tailored to AI projects. As a result, Nvidia's earnings have been climbing in the triple digits in recent quarters -- and investors have flocked to buy the shares.\nThe company announced its stock split during its most recent earnings report, launched the operation last week, and the shares began trading at their new price at the start of trading this week. Here are three things to know about the split and what it means for Nvidia and investors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia stock isn't cheaper than it was before.\nNvidia stock, at the split-adjusted price, now is trading for about $120 a share compared with more than $1,200 last week. The company completed a 10-for-1 stock split, offering more shares to current holders to bring each individual share down to a tenth of the former price.\nThis is a positive move because it makes the stock more accessible for a broader range of investors -- Nvidia even said this was its motive for the split, to make it easier for employees and shareholders to invest. So, today, you don't have to shell out more than $1,000 or buy fractional shares to open a position in Nvidia or add a small amount to your existing position.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this doesn't make Nvidia cheaper than it was prior to the split. The stock still is trading for 44x forward earnings estimates, to use one valuation measure as an example. This is because the split acts on individual share price through the issuance of more shares, but it doesn't change anything fundamental about the particular company and stock. The market value of the company and the value of an investor's holding remain unchanged.\n\n2. The shares made this surprising move after the past three stock splits.\nBecause stock splits are just mechanical moves, they don't act as catalysts for stock movement. So, a stock won't rise or fall just because the company completed this sort of operation. But it is interesting to look back at how Nvidia shares performed following past stock splits. The previous three were in 2006, 2007, and 2021.\nAnd in each case, the shares declined or stagnated in the months following the stock split.\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA data by YCharts\nDoes this mean the same thing will happen this time around? Not necessarily. It's important to consider the economic context or other factors that may have contributed to the stock's performance. For example, the 2006 Nvidia operation happened in the spring -- and in the summer there's often less activity in the market, meaning fewer catalysts to boost the stock. And in 2007, the general market was heading into bear territory.\nFinally, during all three occasions Nvidia's earnings picture was different from its earnings picture today. Then, the gaming industry was a key customer -- today, the main customers are in the high-growth area of AI.\nIt's possible Nvidia shares may trend lower during the slower summer months or in the absence of major news ahead of the company's Blackwell architecture and chip launch later this year -- but this or any other movement isn't due to the stock split.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The stock split shows how Nvidia feels about the future.\nCompanies generally launch stock splits after periods of success. Earnings have been on the rise, and that's pushed shares higher too. In the case of many recent stock splits \u2013 especially in the tech industry -- the particular stock has reached prices that put it out of reach for many investors. By this I mean the level of $1,000, which may be a psychological barrier for some investors. For example, Amazon launched a split in 2022 after its shares soared above $3,000.\nSo, when a company announces a split, that company usually has been doing pretty well when it comes to earnings and share performance. But the announcement also suggests the company, in this case Nvidia, could continue to excel. Management is optimistic that the stock, from its new price, has what it takes to again climb significantly higher.\nAnd a lower per-share price offers it room to run -- because more investors are able to more easily buy the stock.\nWhat does this mean for Nvidia and for you?\nThese are positive times for Nvidia, and considering the high demand for AI products and services, these good times could keep on rolling for the long term. The stock split didn't change any of this -- but it did make it easier for certain investors to get in on the Nvidia story. And that's positive.\n\n\n\n\n\nI considered Nvidia stock a buy prior to the stock split, and my view hasn't changed. Whether the stock continues to soar or dips as it did following previous stock splits, that's OK. Nvidia has the innovation and market leadership to keep earnings advancing -- and that should power this stock higher over the long run.\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Shares are now trading at around $130.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting back to $1,200 would mean a market cap of roughly $30 trillion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia faces competition that will cut into its profit margins and slow growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.11%)\u00a0-$2.52\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.01\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:58 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the split has taken effect, will Nvidia's stock ever get back to where it was?\n\nThe market can't get enough of artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NVDA -2.11%). The semiconductor giant sits just shy of a $3 trillion valuation, making it the third-largest company in the world.\nNvidia is the premier provider of AI chips. Its hardware powers the technology so many believe is the next big thing. Since ChatGPT-3 was first released to the public, Nvidia's stock is up almost 700%, and it tipped above $1,200 a share last week.\n\nShares are now trading at around $130. What happened? No, the company's stock did not crater and lose 90% of its value. Instead, the massive rise in price led the company to initiate a 10-1 stock split. Shareholders now own 10 times as many shares as they did before the split, with each share worth a tenth of the price.\nA split like this is more or less cosmetic; in and of itself, it doesn't change the values of people's investments. However, it's not without consequence. The stock is now more accessible to smaller investors; $130 is much easier to stomach than $1,200, a number that might have kept investors from grabbing a few shares.\nIt wouldn't be the first time\nReaching $1,200 again would mean a 10x from today's price. Nvidia already pulled off a 10x in the last three years, but doing so again would mean reaching a $30 trillion market cap -- a mind-boggling figure. It's a different ball game when you are already the third-largest company in the world, but it's not without precedent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Apple was the second-largest company in the world. The company made headlines that year as it neared a $300 billion market cap. Fast-forward to 2022, and Apple was again in the headlines, this time as the largest company in the world and the first to pass the $3 trillion mark. I bet $3 trillion seemed mind-boggling to a lot of investors in 2010, but here we are.\nLook to the market for clues\nLet's start by assuming Nvidia's growth will slow from the past three years. What's a more reasonable rate? The market as a whole is a good place to start. Statista.com predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 28.5% through 2030 for the entire AI market. If that growth rate holds, it would take roughly nine years for Nvidia's stock to reach $1,200 again.\nBut before you get too excited, there are a few pretty huge assumptions there. We're assuming that projected CAGR holds beyond 2030 and that it isn't overinflated to begin with. Secondly, we're assuming that the market will value Nvidia relative to its earnings the same over time. This isn't necessarily true. Just because a company grows its earnings doesn't mean its stock price will respond in kind, but it's a useful simplification for now.\nSo if we make those assumptions, can Nvidia grow at the same rate as the overall market? I'm not sure it's likely for a few reasons, competition being chief among them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chips won't be in such short supply\nNvidia currently has a near stranglehold on the AI chip market -- about 80%. This gives Nvidia a lot of pricing power, allowing it to enjoy incredible profit margins. But I think this will change.\nLong-time competitors Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are doing everything they can to catch up. To date, they haven't been able to produce something on par with Nvidia in the eyes of the market. But make no mistake, they are trying. AMD CEO Lisa Su said at a recent unveiling of the company's latest chips, \"AI is our No. 1 priority.\" Nvidia isn't the only company capable of producing hardware that can service the industry.\nAnd it's not just rival chipmakers. Perhaps more concerning is that Nvidia's main rivals -- think Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon -- are pouring money into their own chipmaking programs, hoping to detach themselves from outside suppliers altogether. Nvidia will have to stay ahead of the most innovative companies in the world -- and do it at a price that remains competitive.\nA more reasonable view\nCan Nvidia reach $1,200 again? Absolutely. Will it? I think it's likely. When? Don't expect a repeat of the last three years. A more reasonable timeline would be at least a decade. That would still be amazing growth that far outpaces what the vast majority of solid investments return. Getting too hung up on giant multiples or specific price targets can ultimately distract from making sound decisions in the market.\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Over that time frame, the company has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles based on demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). Let's dig deeper into what the next decade could have in store.\nA history of boom and bust cycles \nHistorically, Nvidia has experienced several boom-and-bust cycles based on macroeconomic factors and industry dynamics outside its control. Soon after its initial public offering (IPO) in 1999, the company enjoyed explosive growth based on demand for its GPUs for personal computers and video game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox.\n\nThese are now somewhat mature and highly cyclical markets because they rely on nonessential discretionary spending that can be cut in challenging economic conditions. But by 2010, Nvidia was rescued by a brand-new industry: cryptocurrency mining.\nBlockchain platforms like Bitcoin (and previously Ethereum) run on a system called proof-of-work, where transactions are validated, and new blocks created by solving complex computational puzzles (mining). Nvidia's consumer GPUs were ideal for these tasks, leading to booming sales for much of the 2010s and some of the 2020s. \nBut now, Nvidia has finally gotten its big break with generative artificial intelligence (AI), an opportunity so massive, it has made the company's other business verticals practically irrelevant. \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia over the next 10 years\nFor better or worse, Nvidia has become almost a pure play on data center AI hardware, with its other segments fading into irrelevance. In the first quarter, data center sales represented 87% of the company's $26 billion in revenue, while the once-core gaming and PC segment (which includes cryptocurrency mining rigs) has fallen to just 10%.\nNvidia's poor diversification will likely worsen because the data center segment is growing significantly faster than its other businesses. This dynamic makes the company vulnerable to a potential slowdown in demand for AI chips, which is a significant risk over the coming decade.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nEven if the overall industry meets analysts' lofty expectations (Bloomberg expects generative AI to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032), there may eventually be chip overcapacity as data centers accumulate massive stockpiles of GPUs and feel less need to update to the latest versions. And like in Nvidia's previous boom-and-bust cycles, used chips could erode the market for its new products, leading to lower pricing power and margins. \nThat said, Nvidia is a company that constantly reinvents itself. Few would have expected the video game chipmaker to dominate cryptocurrency mining and eventually generative AI. In the future, new markets such as self-driving car technology, robotics, or warehouse automation could reignite demand for Nvidia's products and rediversify its customer base. \n\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia still a buy?\nNvidia stock still looks capable of outperforming the S&P 500 over the next 10 years -- especially as the AI industry expands out of simple chatbots into more advanced-use cases. That said, the stock has become incredibly risky in the near term because of its overreliance on data center GPUs and the threat of overcapacity in its market. \nInvestors who buy now should be ready to ride through a potential correction. But the better idea might be to hold and wait for more information. \n\n\n\nWill Ebiefung has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Here's What History Shows.      Keith Speights, The Motley Fool   June 7, 2024 5 min read              In This Article:  NVDA          ^GSPC            What does the hottest stock in the S&P 500 do after skyrocketing more than any other large-cap stock on the market? Announcing a major stock split could be a good follow-up. That's exactly what Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is doing. Shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker have nearly tripled over the last 12 months. Nvidia will conduct a 10-for-1 stock split after the market closes today. The stock will begin trading at a much lower share price on Monday, June 10. But will Nvidia stock soar after its stock split? Here's what history shows. Good times ahead? Stock splits change absolutely nothing about a company's business or its growth prospects. All they're guaranteed to do is increase the number of outstanding shares and lower the share price. However, one reason why companies conduct stock splits is that the move can provide a nice catalyst. The idea is that some investors sit on the sidelines with a given stock when it's too expensive for them to buy. But when the share price is lower, they're more willing to purchase shares. This could especially apply to a highly followed stock such as Nvidia.  Is this what history shows? Yes, according to Bank of America's Research Investment Committee. It found that stocks have achieved total returns of 25% in the 12 months after announcing a stock split. By comparison, the S&P 500 rose around 12%, on average, during the same period. But the story isn't quite as good in recent years. Since 2010, stocks with splits have delivered a total return of around 18% during the 12 months following the announcement of a stock split, versus 13% for the S&P 500, according to a report by Statista based on data from Bank of America, Bloomberg, and Global Financial Data. What Nvidia's stock-split history reveals Has Nvidia delivered outstanding gains after its previous stock splits? The company has split its stock five times in the past. Let's look at what happened before and afterward in each case. On June 27, 2000, Nvidia conducted a 2-for-1 stock split. In the weeks leading up to the split, the stock steadily vaulted higher. However, Nvidia's shares fell immediately after the stock split and were down significantly by year-end. One year after the split, the stock was up quite a bit. There's no way to know for sure if this gain was directly attributable to the stock split, though.   NVDA data by YCharts.  Nvidia conducted another 2-for-1 stock split on Sept. 12, 2001. This time, the company's shares fell both ahead of and immediately after the split. The stock rebounded during the rest of the year. However, it then began a steep decline (as did the broader market).   Story Continues   NVDA data by YCharts. Several years passed before Nvidia's next 2-for-1 stock split on April 7, 2006. In this case, the stock rose before the split and then fell shortly afterward. Following a sharp sell-off, Nvidia's shares bounced back. Still, a year later, it was up barely over 1%, while the S&P 500 was up more than 13%.  NVDA data by YCharts. The next year, Nvidia conducted its first 3-for-2 stock split. The stock again climbed ahead of the stock split. The good times didn't last for long, though. Nvidia soon plunged with a much worse decline than the S&P 500.  NVDA data by YCharts. Nvidia conducted a 4-for-1 stock split on July 20, 2021. This was another good news/bad news scenario.The chipmaker's shares jumped both before and immediately after the stock split. A year later, though, Nvidia's share price was lower than when the split occurred. However, Nvidia still managed to outperform the S&P 500 during this period.  NVDA data by YCharts. A better reason to buy Nvidia stockCan we draw any solid conclusions from Nvidia's stock-split history? Unfortunately, no.I wouldn't put too much faith in the Bank of America findings about the long-term outperformance of stocks after announcing splits, either. It's possible that the individual stocks that beat the S&P 500 after announcing stock splits would have done so, even without splitting their shares.There's a much better reason to buy Nvidia stock than its stock split, anyway. The demand for high-powered chips to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models continues to soar. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in the AI chip market, and its rapid speed of innovation seems likely to keep the company at the top for the next few years.This should translate to strong earnings growth. When earnings grow, share prices typically follow -- stock split or no stock split.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Thanks to the booming demand for the AI-enabling hardware they sell, they have experienced stunning accelerations in their revenue and earnings growth.\u00a0\nNvidia's dominance in the AI chip market has translated into phenomenal growth, and Super Micro Computer isn't far behind. Data center operators are flocking to its modular server solutions to mount the AI chips that Nvidia and other companies sell. However, if you are looking to add an AI stock to your portfolio and want to choose between one of these two, which one should you be buying right now?\nThe case for Nvidia\nNvidia reportedly controlled a whopping 94% of the AI chip market at the end of 2023. The company's results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28) suggest that its dominance has it on course for another year of terrific growth.\n\nRevenue rose a stunning 262% year over year to $26 billion. Its impressive pricing power led to a 461% surge in adjusted earnings to $6.12 per share. Management's revenue guidance of $28 billion for the current quarter suggests that its top line is on track to jump 107% year over year, which would be an acceleration from the 101% growth it delivered in the same period last year.\nHowever, emerging growth avenues in the nascent AI market indicate that Nvidia could end up doing even better than that. For instance, governments across the globe are reportedly pouring huge amounts of money into AI infrastructure, and sovereign investments in AI technology are expected to contribute $10 billion to Nvidia's top line this fiscal year, as compared to nothing in the previous one.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore specifically, governments are looking to make large language models (LLMs) in local languages based on country-specific data. On Nvidia's May conference call, management pointed out that Japan, France, Italy, and Singapore are already investing in AI infrastructure. It expects more countries to join the bandwagon. \"The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation,\" said CFO Colette Kress.\nSaudi Arabia, for instance, is reportedly looking to invest $40 billion in AI initiatives, while China's AI-focused spending is forecast to exceed $38 billion by 2027. Meanwhile, key Indian companies such as Tata Group and Reliance Industries are relying on Nvidia's chips to train LLMs.\nIn short, Nvidia's customer base is diversifying beyond the major cloud infrastructure providers that have been deploying its chips in large numbers to train and deploy AI models. Spending on AI chips is expected to grow more than 10-fold over the next decade, generating $341 billion in revenue in 2033 compared to $23 billion last year. The stage seems set for Nvidia to maintain its tremendous growth as it takes solid steps to ensure that it remains the dominant player in this space.\nThat's why analysts forecast that the company's top line will keep growing at a healthy pace from fiscal 2024's reading of nearly $61 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nSo, Nvidia should remain a top AI stock as the race to develop AI applications by companies and governments alike has created a secular growth opportunity.\nThe case for Super Micro Computer\nSupermicro's growth is entwined to some extent with that of Nvidia. Data center operators require server rack solutions of the type that Supermicro sells to mount the processors sold by Nvidia and other chipmakers. So, it is not surprising that demand for Supermicro's servers has simply taken off.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, its revenue jumped 200% year over year. Non-GAAP net income per share, meanwhile, jumped by a whopping 307%. So, Supermicro isn't all that far behind Nvidia when it comes to how AI has supercharged its fortunes. The company is guiding for revenue of $14.9 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends this month. This would be a big jump over the $7.1 billion in revenue it reported in its fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, analysts are expecting its top line to nearly double over the next couple of fiscal years.\n\nSMCI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\nThe good part is that Supermicro can sustain a healthy pace of growth beyond the next couple of fiscal years. That's because the demand for AI servers is expected to expand at a compound annual rate of 25% through 2029. The market is expected to generate annual revenue of almost $73 billion after five years, up from $17.5 billion in 2022.\nSupermicro is growing at a faster pace than the AI server market right now. As it turns out, its growth is faster than that of more established companies such as Dell Technologies, which has sold $3 billion worth of AI servers in the past three quarters. Supermicro generated $9.6 billion in revenue in the past three quarters and gets more than half its revenue from selling AI-related server solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupermicro has been able to make a dent in the AI server market despite the presence of bigger players. Also, with the moves that the company has been making to increase its production-utilization rate and its manufacturing capacity, it could corner a bigger share of the AI server market in the future.\nLike Nvidia, even Supermicro looks like a solid long-term AI play. But is it worth buying over Nvidia?\nThe verdict\nBoth Nvidia and Supermicro are high-growth companies benefiting big time from the proliferation of AI. So investors' choice about which stock they may want to buy right now is going to boil down to the valuation. Supermicro is substantially cheaper than Nvidia as far as their earnings and sales multiples are concerned.\n\nSMCI PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in terms of the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, the story is a bit more interesting. That metric is a forward-looking valuation determined by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by the earnings growth that it is expected to deliver over a future period. Any (positive) PEG ratio below 1 is viewed by most investors as indicating a bargain stock. And on that metric, both Nvidia and Supermicro are undervalued.\n\nSMCI PEG Ratio data by YCharts.\nSo by at least one forward-looking measure, both Nvidia and Supermicro are attractive buys right now for anyone looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios. More importantly, both these companies seem capable of delivering the outstanding growth that the market expects from them, thanks to the lucrative opportunities they are sitting on.

Anyone with a position in the artificial intelligence (AI) leader will be a part of the 10-for-1 Nvidia stock split, which begins today. Shares of NVDA stock are down today as the market prepares for this significant change. But that\u2019s to be expected when a major company undergoes a stock split.\nEven if shares finish out this week in the red, investors should expect Nvidia to rebound next week as the market adjusts to NVDA stock trading on a split-adjusted basis. While investors who currently hold shares can benefit from the stock split, trading at a post-split price won\u2019t actually commence until June 10.\nThe NVDA Stock Split: What to Expect\nWhen a company splits its stock, it does so to make shares accessible to new investors. That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here. With Nvidia touching $1,200 per share this week and exceeding a $3 trillion market capitalization, it\u2019s safe to say that this event comes at a good time. Even after the stock split, NVDA will still trade at a high price level. As InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto reports:\n\n\u201cBuying NVDA stock can be onerous for investors who lack access to brokerages offering fractional equity ownership. Pre-split, the security is trading hands around $1,200, which may not be accessible to many retail investors. Essentially, NVDA\u2019s success has become its own challenge. However, with a 10-for-1 split, the per-unit offering will be lowered, enabling greater access.\u201d\n\nMany retail investors will likely scramble to start buying up shares as soon as the Nvidia stock split takes effect on Monday. If that happens, shares will surge as the trendy frenzy pushes the newly split stock higher.\nWe\u2019ve seen what can happen when investors pile into a stock at the same time. Most meme stocks that investors often pile into aren\u2019t worth owning. But NVDA is one of the best performing stocks on the Nasdaq right now, with gains of more than 200% over the past year. With its share price lowered, most people will want to take advantage before NVDA stock starts surging again.\nOn the date of publication, Samuel O\u2019Brient\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\nSamuel O\u2019Brient is a Reporter for InvestorPlace, where his work focuses primarily on financial markets, global economic trends, and public policy.

Apple ranks 5th in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look. There has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future \u2014 productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn\u2019t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.  One doesn\u2019t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee. Methodology For this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    Photo by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 150 Notable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes \"owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return\" because the market is in denial about Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI potential.   Story Continues The Wall Street is running out of patience with Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0amid Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI strategy that's been so far nonexistent and lagging behind competitors. But Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0bulls believe Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will shine through in the AI race. The market is now awaiting the WWDC event where Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is expected to reveal its AI plans. Dan Ives of Wedbush, one of the biggest Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0bulls, recently said that WWDC \u00a0is the \"most important event for Apple in over a decade as the pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center.\"Ives thinks Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0shares.Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a09.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of this could change if Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0is able to pull AI-related catalysts out of its bag. The WWDC event and the new few weeks and months would be critical for Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0growth trajectory.The first signs of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine, \u00a0will be \u201cmore powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.\u201d Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Neural Engine is Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\u201cApple Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company\u2019s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company\u2019s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps. Overall, Apple Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th\u00a0in Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks.\u00a0You can visit Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks to see the other AI stocks that are on analysts' radar. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple, our conviction lies in the belief that smaller AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a0Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

One Analyst Slaps $4T Pr\u2026ImportantExclusiveNVDA: Nvidia Slips from Intraday Record. One Analyst Slaps $4T Price Tag on Chip Maker.NVDAKey points:Nvidia touches intraday record.  Shares roll back into a daily loss.  Analyst\u2019s brave call for $4 trillion.  Illustration by TradingViewChip giant is up nearly 170% on the year. Recent 10-for-1 stock split helped push shares to fresh all-time high Monday. Nvidia stock NVDA jumped to a record high during Monday\u2019s session but lost the momentum and rolled over into a loss for the day. The chip giant, and the leading actor in the action-packed AI bonanza, shot up by about 1% to an intraday record of $133 a share. Something feels off? Yes \u2014 Nvidia underwent a 10-for-1 stock split, which watered down 1 share into 10 and broke up the price per share.  Nvidia is still a monster company, rocking a $3.22 trillion valuation and proudly taking the third spot in the world\u2019s biggest companies. Shares of the Jensen Huang-led tech firm have gained nearly 170% this year as investors have capitalized on the huge demand for AI servers. There\u2019s no shortage of that \u2014 Nvidia projects its revenue for the current quarter to land at $28 billion.  Supporting the \u201cup only\u201d narrative, Wall Street remains fiercely bullish on the stock. An analyst from trading firm Susquehanna has slapped a target price of $160 per Nvidia share, an upgrade from a previous call for $145 a pop. To get to that lofty valuation, Nvidia will need to add roughly 20% on top of its current hulk-like market cap. That would position it as the world\u2019s most expensive company with a formidable price tag of just under $4 trillion.

Register for this free strategy session today.\r\nShares of Nvidia Corp NVDA have taken a significant hit, dropping 12.8% in just three trading days.\nThe stock closed at $135.58 on June 18, only to fall to $118.11 by June 24. This sharp decline has raised eyebrows among investors, especially given the broader market\u2019s relatively stable performance, with the S&P 500 index-tracking SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY closing at $548.49 and $542.74, respectively, on those dates. That\u2019s a drop of just 1.048% over the three trading days.\nNvidia Down Over 12% On Profit Taking\nDespite the pullback, Nvidia\u2019s fundamentals remain strong. The company\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, driven by strong performance in its data center and automotive segments. Nvidia\u2019s forward revenue guidance remains robust, indicating sustained demand for its AI solutions even amid broader market headwinds.\nGiven no fundamental or news-related cause for the stock\u2019s recent slide, Wall Street watchers are suggesting it could be profit taking by Nvidia stock investors, given Nvidia recently became the most valuable public company.\nRelated: Microsoft, Apple Step Aside: Nvidia Is Now The Most Valuable Public Company In The World\nHence, the significant price drop could be seen as a buying opportunity for a high-quality stock like Nvidia. \nLet\u2019s delve into the technical indicators to understand the current trend and potential future movements of Nvidia stock.\nNvidia Stock Chart \u2013 Near-Term Weakness, Solid Long-Term Strength\n\nCurrent Trend: Moderately bearish, with Nvidia stock experiencing selling pressure, indicating a risk of further bearish movement.\n\n\nChart: Benzinga Pro\n\n8-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA): NVDA is at $121.11, below its 8-day SMA of $128.08, signaling a bearish trend.\n20-Day SMA: The stock is at $121.11, just below the 20-day SMA of $121.86, also a bearish indicator.\n50-Day SMA: NVDA at $121.11 is above its 50-day SMA of $102.19, suggesting a bullish outlook in the medium term.\n200-Day SMA: NVDA is significantly above its 200-day SMA of $70.14, creating a bullish signal in the long term.\n\n\nChart: Benzinga Pro\n\nMACD Indicator: At 6.86, the MACD suggests bullish momentum.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): At 55.41, NVDA is neither overbought nor oversold.\nBollinger Bands (20): The bands range from $107.50 to $136.21, indicating that NVDA is within a bollinger bands\u2019 range and trading in the upper bullish band.\n\nWhile the recent downtrend and technical indicators suggest caution in the short term, Nvidia\u2019s strong fundamentals and long-term bullish signals present a compelling case for investors considering buying the dip. \nWill the slide continue, or is this a prime buying opportunity? Only time will tell, but Nvidia\u2019s robust position in the market and its impressive track record suggest it remains a stock to watch closely.\nRead Next: \n\nNasdaq, S&P 500 Futures Firm Up As Nvidia Poised To Lead Tech Rebound: Expert Says \u2018A Major Gaffe By One Of The Candidates\u2019 In Presidential Debate Could Alter Market Trajectory\n\nPhoto: ShutterstockNVDANVIDIA Corp$116.58-2.46%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock \u2013 anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum84.14Growth88.69Quality96.81Value6.97Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewSPYSPDR S&P 500$560.83-1.11%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n        \n\n\nDigital technology providers have long been frustrated with what they see as utilities\u2019 innovation-impeding focus on reliability. But rapid load growth and potential artificial intelligence solutions are inspiring collaboration, particularly on ways to use and share power system data.\u00a0\nUtilities have seen the data on significant projected load growth from transportation, manufacturing, building electrification and data centers.\u00a0And tech companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, IBM and Schneider Electric are beginning to understand the regulatory barriers holding utilities back from transitioning to advanced AI computing strategies, executives said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital technologies\u2019 skyrocketing computational power and hyperscale cloud resources are transforming previous assumptions about AI\u2019s potential to learn, execute\u00a0and optimize system operations,\u00a0starting utilities on what some are calling the \u201ctechnology transition.\u201d\n\u201cThe utility industry is conservative, but it faces clean energy and emissions reduction mandates,\u201d said Marc Spieler, senior managing director, energy, for microprocessor market leader NVIDIA. Advanced computing\u2019s \u201creal time predictions can optimize\u201d\u00a0decision making on things like bulk system dispatch and maintenance and NVIDIA\u2019s \u201cdedicated modules will apply learning from other industries to the energy transition,\u201d he added.\nUtilities have used advanced computing in wildfire mitigation, vegetation management and predictive maintenance, and are beginning to consider its potential to optimize system dispatch, analysts said.\n\u201cThe technology business model is \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 and they haven\u2019t always understood why regulated utilities don\u2019t move as fast,\u201d said Edison Electric Institute General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Executive Vice President, Clean Energy,\u00a0Emily Sanford Fisher. \u201cBut there seems to be a new spirit of cooperation on solving utility challenges.\u201d\nOne obstacle may slow this technology transition. Tech companies have seen how innovations in advanced computing from other sectors can maximize AI capabilities. But utilities still must verify that potential and convince regulators that investments in implementing advanced computing capabilities are justified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe challenge and the potential\nThe rapidly rising load growth is clear.\n\u201cOver the past year, grid planners nearly doubled the 5-year load growth forecast\u201d from \u201c2.6% to 4.7% growth,\u201d a December 2023 Grid Strategies study reported. The 2024 forecast \u201cis likely to show an even higher nationwide growth rate,\u201d driven by investment in new manufacturing, industrial, and data centers,\u00a0it added. \nBroad use of advanced computing is now providing \u201csome decision support to bulk system operators\u201d for managing the new load, said Jeremy Renshaw, senior technical executive, AI, quantum, and innovation, with the Electric Power Research Institute. \nBut fully optimizing distribution system operations and dispatch \u201ccould be one breakthrough or years away,\u201d Renshaw added. \nMany tech companies are putting advanced computing to work in hopes of finding that breakthrough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermission granted by Grid Strategies\n\u00a0\n\n\nTech companies at work\nAdvanced computing is starting to serve utilities.\nBrightNight\u2019s PowerAlpha platform can help design, operate and optimize clean energy projects to significantly increase load factors and reduce costs, said BrightNight Chief Technology Officer Kiran Kumaraswamy. Its machine learning and AI-based algorithms are focused on utility-scale assets, but it does not have \u201cthe level of granularity to optimize the distribution system,\u201d he said.\nWeather forecasts using machine learning have allowed Amperon clients to buy lower-priced power ahead of extreme events instead of facing elevated scarcity pricing, said Amperon CEO and co-founder Sean Kelly. \u201cA person can\u2019t compute hourly updates on 15-day forecasts and weekly longer term forecasts for up to 28 weather variables at 30,000 locations,\u201d he added.\n\u201cCall it machine learning or AI,\u201d but the Neara-built \u201ccomputerized replica\u201d of the Southern California Edison system will \u201capply more variables than a human can assimilate,\u201d said Rob Brook, senior vice president and managing director, Americas, at advanced computing provider Neara. It \u201cidentifies ways to improve\u201d wildfire mitigation and \u201cremoves human error and human cost,\u201d he added.\nBut while much of the current focus on AI in the power sector is on bulk system and maintenance,\u00a0one advanced computing-based company appears to be on the verge of a breakthrough in using advanced computing at the distribution system level.\n\u201cUtilidata is deploying the first distribution system AI platform,\u201d using a \u201ccustomized NVIDIA module,\u201d said Utilidata President and Chief Operating Officer Jess Melanson. It is now being installed with Aclara meters, but it will \u201ceventually be used in other system hardware like transformers,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nBoth NVIDIA and Utilidata see \u201chuge opportunity\u201d in power system applications,\u00a0Melanson said. \u201cUntil now, Utilidata analyses have used incomplete, old, or bad data,\u201d but the world-standard NVIDIA chip allows Utilidata\u2019s Karman platform analysis to detail \u201cwhat is happening on the system, what will likely happen next, and what the best responses are,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nThat level of intelligence at the distribution system level could allow customer-owned resources to play a greater role in reliability and reduce overall customer costs.\nA key potential obstruction to realizing the benefits of advanced computing is limited access to utility and private customer data. It is a challenge those in the advanced computing world, including NVIDIA and IBM, take seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOE. (2024). \"AI for Energy\" [pdf]. Retrieved from DOE.\n\u00a0\n\n\nFoundation modeling and federated learning\nNVIDIA\u2019s software allows advanced computing \u201cto anticipate patterns in the data and identify the next best action,\u201d according to NVIDIA\u2019s Spieler. It could, for instance, allow utilities to have a greater understanding of where outages might occur and do proactive maintenance, several analysts said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe challenge of utilities not sharing the proprietary data needed to develop a greater and more granular understanding of the power system is real, \u201cbut federated learning, which is used in healthcare to protect patient data, can be a solution,\u201d Spieler said. \u201cWith federated learning, collaborators can build models of their data and share it at a centralized location,\u201d he added.\nNVIDIA FLARE, a federated learning software tool, \u201cbuilds additional synthetic data to solve new problems,\u201d which answers privacy concerns, Spieler said.\n\u201cUtilities take data security seriously,\u201d and must be sure it will be shared \u201cin the right way,\u201d EEI\u2019s Fisher said. \u201cThere must be protocols to protect critical energy infrastructure information,\u201d though \u201cit is good news that there are constructive conversations about how to work together to do that,\u201d she added. \nSome think federated learning may be too limited a model for the complexities of the power system\u2019s diverse regional uniquenesses and varying resource mixes.\n\u201cFoundation models are emerging to expand advanced computing capabilities,\u201d said IBM Global Chief Technology Officer and Solution Leader, Energy, Environment and Utilities, Bryan Sacks.\u00a0\nInstead of AI components being applied to individual problems, \u201corders of magnitude more data are pre-trained as a foundation model for multiple problems,\u201d Sacks said. A foundation model could capture the power system\u2019s diversity without divulging any operator\u2019s proprietary specifics.\u00a0But \u201cthe metering and monitoring system data used by utilities for operational decisions is not in current large language models and is protected from being shared externally,\u201d he added.\n\u201cFor a foundation model to understand power system operations, it needs specific time and place data for each connected asset, but that data must be anonymized,\u201d Sacks said. \u201cIBM has started a working group to build a foundation model to be trained from anonymized data for power system real-time and day ahead operations and long-term planning,\u201d he added.\nDifferent power system stakeholders would be able \u201cto fine tune that foundation model to solve their different problems,\u201d Sacks said. But \u201cregulatory barriers or restrictions on market participants obtaining access to the data needed to train the model is a real concern,\u201d he added.\nIBM is engaging global stakeholders to contribute primary research, according to Sacks. It will also engage regulators \u201cto help establish a governance system that will facilitate data sharing,\u201d and build effective \u201cguardrails\u201d to protect the system and the data, he said. \nIBM\u2019s recognition of regulatory issues puts it on common ground with what utilities say is their foremost concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOE. (2024). \"AI and Utilities\" [pdf]. Retrieved from DOE.\n\u00a0\n\n\nUtilities and regulators\nUtilities seem more realistic than tech companies about the regulatory barriers to advanced computing.\nUsing advanced computing to optimize the distribution system in real time will require utilities and regulators to have \u201cenough confidence\u201d in it, said Steve Smith, National Grid group head of strategy, innovation and market analytics and president of National Grid Partners Corporate Venture Capital Fund. \u201cWe could be there in 10 years or 15 years,\u201d he added.\n\u201cTech companies and utilities have radically different business models,\u201d and \u201ctech companies don\u2019t understand why it takes 10 years to bring new transmission online,\u201d added EEI\u2019s Fisher. It actually only takes regulated utilities \u201c18 months to 24 months to build transmission, but it takes them eight years to site, permit and litigate it,\u201d she said.\nIntroducing advanced computing will require \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d for utilities and regulators concerned about rising rates that \u201cthe needed grid modernization expenditures will reduce customer costs,\u201d Fisher said.\n\u201cFoundation models have a lot of potential for the energy industry,\u201d and data federation is \u201cabsolutely required to derive and harmonize data from disparate siloed utility systems,\u201d said Scott Harden, chief technology officer for global innovation with electric technology provider Schneider Electric. \nAn ideal power system architecture would be built on a power sector foundation model that captures the key features of its diversity and challenges,\u00a0Harden said. It would also have much more extensive deployment of phasor measurement units\u00a0\u2014\u00a0hardware devices that can record and transmit transmission and distribution system data \u2014\u00a0as well as \u201cfull deployment of smart meters at the system edge, and all data would be federated,\u201d he added.\nBuilding that architecture could begin with regulatory support of \u201cthe new computing power and the technologies needed to make it work,\u201d Harden said. It is not yet clear how burdensome the cost and time for deployment would be, \u201cbut the more important question is what the cost would be for not deploying it,\u201d he added. \n\u201cIt is early days for everyone in a big AI space, and the question now is how to navigate that space,\u201d\u00a0Commissioner Allison Clements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told Utility Dive. Advanced computing applications now in use \u201ccan create a positive feedback loop if federal and state regulators drive it,\u201d she added. \n\u201cRegulators must have a growth mindset in this moment of change because this is the early part of the messy middle of grid modernization,\u201d Clements said.

NVIDIA GPUs are known for their powerful graphics processing capabilities, making them well-suited for running graphics-intensive applications like ArcGIS Pro.\n\u00a0\nWhen virtualizing ArcGIS Pro with NVIDIA GPUs, organizations can take advantage of GPU passthrough or virtual GPU (vGPU) technologies. GPU passthrough allows a physical GPU to be directly assigned to a virtual machine, providing dedicated GPU resources, and maximizing performance. On the other hand, vGPU technology allows multiple virtual machines to share a single physical GPU, providing virtualized GPU resources.\nBy utilizing NVIDIA GPUs in a virtualized environment, ArcGIS Pro benefits from accelerated rendering, improved visualization, and faster processing of complex geospatial data. This is particularly useful for tasks such as 3D visualization, spatial analysis, and rendering large datasets.\n\u00a0\nTo implement ArcGIS Pro virtualization with NVIDIA GPUs, organizations need to ensure that their virtualization platform supports GPU passthrough or vGPU technology. They also need to consider the hardware requirements, such as the number and type of NVIDIA GPUs needed to meet their performance needs.\nMuch like each release of ArcGIS Pro, NVIDIA each year releases new or updated GPUs, some for desktops and some GPUs for server use.\u00a0 After several years in the marketplace these offerings change, or in some cases just become unavailable.\u00a0 Some of these GPU offerings can even seem so new yet in actuality be near the end of sales or their service life.\u00a0 A couple examples of this would be the GPUs such as the M60 and even the T4.\u00a0 Each of these had a rather long life in the market but newer and more capable modern GPUs are available as replacements for these.\nEsri continues to maintain a strong partnership with NVIDIA, and continuously tests ArcGIS Pro in our virtual test environments with the latest NVIDIA GPUs.\u00a0 Testing involves various testing methods from hands on testing, to scripted tests that also include using the publicly available ArcGIS Pro Performance Assessment Tool.\nThe ArcGIS Pro Performance Assessment Tool, casually referred to as PAT is available for download and is an easy way to gauge performance of any desktop or VM (On-Premises or Cloud Hosted).\nCurrent GPUs that support ArcGIS Pro Virtualization are the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA L4\nNVIDIA A10\n\n\nNVIDIA L40 /L40S\nNVIDIA A100\n\n\nNVIDIA A40\nNVIDIA H100\n\n\n\nClick the link for additional information from NVIDIA on their GPUs for Virtualization:\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/graphics-cards-for-virtualization/\n\u00a0\nThe following link will provide server related information to help match the appropriate GPU to the server provider.\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/vgpu-certified-servers/\nAdditionally, organizations should consider the licensing requirements for using ArcGIS Pro in a virtualized environment with NVIDIA GPUs. It\u2019s important to consult with Esri or NVIDIA for guidance on licensing and compatibility.\nIn summary, ArcGIS Pro virtualization with NVIDIA GPUs offers exceptional performance and capabilities for users, enabling them to leverage the power of GPUs for enhanced graphics processing and data analysis. It\u2019s a valuable option for organizations looking to optimize their ArcGIS Pro workflows in a virtualized environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare this article\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nannouncements                    \n3d visualization & analytics                        \narcgispro                        \ngpu                        \nnvidia                        \nvgpu                        \nvirtualization                        \narcgis pro                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Ryan Danzey                                \n\n\n                                Esri Performance Engineering.                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Article Discussion:\n        \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Subscribe\n\n\n\n\nLogin \n\n\n\n\nNotify of \n\n\nnew follow-up comments\nnew replies to my comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease login to comment\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments                    \n\n\n\nOldest\n\n\nNewest\n\n\n\n\n\n Inline Feedbacks                    \nView all comments\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    Load More Comments                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Related articles\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        May 31, 2024                                        | Ryan Danzey\n|\nAnnouncements\n\nArcGIS Pro Virtualization Hardware and VM Profiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        March 12, 2020                                        | Ryan Danzey\n|\nBusiness\n\nAnnouncing the New ArcGIS Pro Virtualization White Paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        May 23, 2024                                        |                                        Multiple Authors\n                                        |\n3D Visualization & Analytics\n\nVirtualizing 3D training models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsertYou are going to send email to SendMove CommentMove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopens in new window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So, to keep itself at the top of the game, Nvidia has diversified its business into the world of cloud service software and rentals, The Information reported.Last year, Nvidia started its cloud service, DGX Cloud, a competitor to some of Nvidia's own customers, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. DGX Cloud rents Nvidia-powered servers from within AWS' data centers and then, promising greater computing capability, leases them back to Nvidia's customers, The Information reported.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told The Information the suggestion that AWS was concerned about upsetting Nvidia was \"speculative and incorrect.\"When contacted by Business Insider, the spokesperson disputed The Information's report and said Amazon worked closely with Nvidia to develop features in the DGX Cloud offering that gave customers \"the best of both companies.\"\"We worked closely with Nvidia to develop a DGX offering that brings customers the best of both companies, and we invested the time and resources needed to ensure that our offering met the incredibly high bar that our customers expect of us,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. \n\n\"We wanted to engineer an offering that would bring together Nvidia's cutting-edge Blackwell GPU technology with AWS technologies, like EFA for better scale networking and Nitro for more secure and better performing virtualization, because we believe these compelling capabilities will resonate with customers\u2014and that is what DGX Cloud on AWS will deliver,\" the statement continued. \"It's another great example of two close partners working together to engineer the best place to run GPUs in the cloud.\"Through DGX Cloud, Nvidia has creatively maneuvered itself into a position where its own customers are helping it compete with them. But CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive strategy to maintain dominance doesn't stop there, The Information reported.\u00a0Nvidia is also requiring customers to build out more space to house the GPUs they buy\u00a0\u2014 and telling them how to do it.\"Nvidia will not ship GPUs unless the customer can certify that they have data-center capacity in which to place those GPUs,\" Raul Martynek, who works with cloud providers as the CEO of DataBank, told The Information.\n\nThe outlet reported that the titan chipmaker, in addition to demanding its clients provide proof of their expanded data-center capacity, was also telling customers how to design the racks that hold the servers and GPUs within those data centers.And because the racks are specifically designed to fit Nvidia chips, it could make it difficult for the customer to switch to chips from competing companies without incurring tremendous costs.For now, Nvidia and its clients such as Amazon have agreed to continue their somewhat symbiotic relationship, but that hasn't stopped competition from brewing on both sides. While Nvidia has expanded into cloud services, AWS is also developing its own AI chips, named Trainium and Inferentia, which aim to compete with Nvidia's.\n\nThough its current strategy is clever enough to have propelled Nvidia to become the world's most valuable company, the company's quest for industry dominance could come back to bite it. Politico reported earlier this month that the Department of Justice was looking to launch an investigation into potential antitrust violations.The report said the DOJ was preparing to investigate whether Nvidia came to become the leading supplier of high-end semiconductors through anticompetitive behavior.A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment when reached by BI.\n\nUpdate June 20, 2024: This story has been updated with additional clarification and comment from Amazon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider\n      subscribers.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Nvidia has become the second most valuable company in the world. On Wednesday afternoon, the chipmaking giant\u2019s market capitalization hit $3.01 trillion, putting it just ahead of Apple at $3 trillion.As Nvidia dominates the AI race with its flagship H100 chip, the company\u2019s market cap has only continued to rise. Nvidia became a $1 trillion company in May 2023, then skyrocketed past $2 trillion in February of this year, making it more valuable than both Amazon and Alphabet.Screenshot: The VergeIn May, Nvidia reported making a whopping $14 billion in profit on account of all the chips it\u2019s selling. Nvidia now only trails behind Microsoft, which currently has a market cap of $3.15 trillion. The chipmaker\u2019s stock currently sits at more than $1,220 per share, but Nvidia plans on splitting the stock on June 7th.Nvidia\u2019s AI accelerators make up between 70 percent and 95 percent of the market share for AI chips, according to CNBC. The company now plans to launch a new AI chip on a yearly basis, starting with the Blackwell B200 GPU that\u2019s expected later this year.See More: AIAppleBusinessNewsNvidiaTechMore in this streamSee allNvidia announces Blackwell Ultra GB300 and Vera Rubin, its next AI \u2018superchips\u2019Sean Hollister11 minutes agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleIntel is reportedly testing its 18A process again.Umar ShakirMar 3CommentsComment Icon BubbleNvidia\u2019s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, will be unveiled next month.Sean HollisterFeb 26CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsPixel 9A leaks in review videos before it\u2019s even announcedInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Alario \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in NVIDIA Corp. v. E. Ohman J:Or Fonder AB., Case No. 23-970,\u00a0to address two fundamental questions about how federal securities fraud cases must be pled to survive a motion to dismiss\u2014an issue that arises in nearly every such case.\u00a0In order to properly state a claim for fraudulent misstatements or omissions under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d) requires plaintiffs, among other things, to: (1) plead \u201cfacts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\u201d (i.e., fraudulent intent); and (2) \u201cstate with particularity all facts\u201d supporting a claim of falsity (i.e., demonstrate that the statement or omission at issue was, in fact, misleading).[1]\u00a0The Supreme Court is set to weigh in on whether plaintiffs can meet the PSLRA\u2019s pleading requirements for scienter and falsity, respectively, by: (1) alleging without specificity that internal company documents contradicted the defendant\u2019s public statements; and (2) relying on expert opinion to create an inference of falsity as a substitute for particularized allegations of fact. \u00a0While the Ninth Circuit recently allowed such allegations to satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s \u201cstrong inference\u201d and \u201cparticularity\u201d requirements, other courts (and petitioning defense counsel) contend that they are insufficient.The case, to be heard during the upcoming 2024\u20132025 term, adds to the roster of recent high-profile Supreme Court cases concerning securities class actions (including Facebook, Inc. v. Amalgamated Bank, which the Court is also set to decide next term) and is likely to have a significant impact on how such cases are litigated going forward.NVIDIA\u2019s Petition for Certiorari\u00a0In petitioning for certiorari, the electronic chip manufacturer NVIDIA sought review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the PSLRA to revive investors\u2019 claims regarding the company CEO\u2019s alleged knowledge of the underlying drivers of NVIDIA\u2019s graphics processing unit (\u201cGPU\u201d) chip demand and, specifically, whether the CEO knowingly understated the degree to which crypto asset mining operations was driving such demand (an issue that allegedly became apparent when NVIDIA\u2019s GPU chip sales declined after the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d in 2018).\u00a0NVIDIA explains that plaintiffs sought to establish their claims neither by alleging the actual number of NVIDIA GPU chips used by crypto miners nor by alleging that NVIDIA\u2019s CEO actually possessed such data, but instead by: (1) hiring an expert to analyze public data about crypto mining activities and the amount of computing power needed to conduct those activities and to estimate the number of GPUs required for such activities and the percentage of such GPUs that were likely manufactured by NVIDIA; and (2) alleging, based on confidential witness testimony, that internal NVIDIA documents analyzed GPU sales and usage data, without citing the specific contents of those documents, or whether NVIDIA\u2019s CEO knew about the contents of the documents before he commented on the company\u2019s GPU sales. \u00a0While the district court found that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations did not satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s \u201cstrong inference\u201d and \u201cparticularity\u201d pleading requirements, and therefore dismissed the complaint, the Ninth Circuit reversed. \u00a0In its petition for Supreme Court review, NVIDIA contended that plaintiffs\u2019 expert report lacked particularity, and instead presented a \u201cchain of dubious assumptions\u201d in an attempt to show that NVIDIA had generated more revenue from sales to crypto miners than had been publicly disclosed, and that plaintiffs\u2019 scienter allegations were based on pure speculation \u201cabout what internal company documents might have said, without any particularized allegations about what the documents actually said\u201d and, therefore, could not support a strong inference of fraudulent intent.\u00a0According to NVIDIA, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding permitting the case to go forward is not only erroneous, but also contrary to decisions from five circuit courts of appeal (the Second, Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Tenth), which require plaintiffs who seek to plead scienter based upon internal contradictory corporate documents to plead with particularity the \u201cactual contents of internal company documents allegedly reviewed by the relevant company executives\u201d (often through confidential witness statements), and from two circuit courts of appeal (the Second and Fifth), which have held that expert opinion cannot function as a proper substitute for particularized allegations of falsity. \u00a0The petition highlighted in particular the circuit split between the Second and the Ninth Circuits on these issues, since those two circuits \u201cdominate the market for class action securities fraud litigation,\u201d with \u201capproximately 60% of federal class action securities fraud litigation activity.\u201d\u00a0ConclusionScienter and falsity are two fundamental and, as a result, highly litigated elements of securities fraud cases. \u00a0Indeed, almost every motion to dismiss a federal securities class action lawsuit challenges the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning one or both of those elements. \u00a0As a result, the Supreme Court\u2019s forthcoming views on how those elements can be established for pleading purposes are likely to have a very significant impact on how such cases are litigated going forward. \u00a0Moreover, the case could have a relatively wide-ranging impact, since recent studies show that nearly 4% of all publicly-listed companies are sued for supposed securities fraud in any given year. \u00a0We will continue to monitor the case.\u00a0\u00a0[1] 15 U.S.C \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1), (2)(A).\nSubscribe To Viewpoints\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished\n\n\nJune 24, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Practices\n\n\nSecurities Litigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Industries\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason C.

However, a new report indicates that Nvidia believes it can get an export license to sell its AI GPUs to a telecom giant operating in multiple Middle East countries.Nvidia has entered into a deal with Ooredoo to 'introduce its AI technology' in datacenters across five Middle Eastern countries, reports\u00a0Reuters. This collaboration signifies Nvidia's first major expansion in a region where the U.S. has restricted exports of advanced AI and HPC processors to prevent Chinese access to cutting-edge technologies to train its large language AI models or even advance its military capabilities.\u00a0Ooredoo, a telecom giant, will now offer Nvidia's AI and HPC GPUs in its datacenters located in Qatar, Algeria, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait, and the Maldives. This development positions Ooredoo as the region's first company to offer such services to its clients, granting them a significant competitive edge in deploying generative AI applications. What is unclear is how Ooredoo will prevent Chinese entities from\u00a0accessing these GPUs in the cloud.Aziz Aluthman Fakhroo, Ooredoo's CEO, highlighted that this agreement will allow their business clients to access services that their competitors might not have for another 18 to 24 months. Unfortunately, it is unclear which GPUs Nvidia will supply to its partners in the Middle East and the value of the deal also remains undisclosed. While the U.S. allows the export of certain Nvidia technologies to the Middle East, it restricts the most advanced chips. Ooredoo did not specify which Nvidia GPUs will be deployed, indicating only that this\u00a0will depend on availability and customer needs.When it comes to power, Ooredoo is investing $1 billion to expand its regional datacenter capacity by 20-25 additional megawatts, adding to its current 40 megawatts, according to Reuters. The company aims to nearly triple its capacity by the end of the decade, reflecting its commitment to install substantial computing capacity.\u00a0Ooredoo has separated its datacenters into an independent company.\u00a0\u00a0The company also plans to spin off its undersea cables and fiber network into another separate entity. These moves are part of Ooredoo's strategy to optimize its operations and increase its market competitiveness.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (12)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

Revenue has more than doubled year-on-year for the last three straight quarters. Having pushed longtime leader Intel Corp. back to the rearview mirror, Nvidia recently declared a 10-for-1 stock split just to keep share prices affordable.\nBut let\u2019s ask a more nuanced question. Granted, at some point the laws of gravity will hit Nvidia. But the operable question is how defensible Nvidia\u2019s position is over the long haul. The answer may hinge not just on how effectively Nvidia maintains its technology edge, but also the degree of stickiness of the platform. For AI developers, how easy will it be to move on or off Nvidia? Are the barriers sufficiently high that we are witnessing the birth of a de facto AI mainframe?\nAs we noted earlier this year, Nvidia dominates the supply chain for advanced AI processors. Amazon Web Services Inc.\u00a0and Google Cloud have introduced their own specialized silicon while Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u00a0and Intel are anxiously gearing up. And if this were only just generic silicon, yes, there are going to be lead times for ramping up the manufacturing capacity, but eventually, the laws of supply and demand should level the playing field, just as Intel and AMD chips became interchangeable not only for \u201cWintel\u201d computers, but also Macs.\nBut here\u2019s the spoiler. We\u2019re not just talking about chips and fabs. Over the past 15-plus years, Nvidia has been busy building a top-to-bottom technology stack that presents the opportunity for classic lock-in. Atop its processor portfolio is a broadening software stack that is transforming Nvidia into an end-to-end software and hardware computing platform. Spanning from chip to supercomputer to libraries, tools and microservices, Nvidia AI Enterprise is built with a unified, fit-for-purpose architecture that has uncanny parallels with the mainframe.\nWhile Nvidia was founded back in the 1990s designing chips for gamers, the enterprise story begins in 2006 with the introduction of CUDA, a portfolio of 150-plus libraries, software development kits, and profiling and optimization tools from Nvidia and partners. Nvidia had to reengineer its entire chip portfolio to run CUDA.\nShort for Compute Unified Device Architecture, CUDA is a parallel computing platform that enables developers to define parallel functions that run on Nvidia GPUs. CUDA enables developers to work with application programming interfaces rather than having to write low-level drivers, just as they were accustomed to working in the CPU world.\nThe CUDA portfolio is especially rich, supporting functions for deep learning, linear algebra, signal processing (for audio and video), generalized parallel and data processing computations, along with specialized capabilities for computational lithography and communications, to name a few. It abstracts the complexities of GPU programming; developers focus on allocating memory and setting up data transfers rather than have to worry about how to parallelize writes to the processor.\nNvidia viewed the GPU as the alternative to classic high-performance computing architecture used for scientific compute workloads. Where traditional HPC ganged hundreds or thousands of CPUs, GPUs concentrated compute on the chip, and was optimized for compute- rather than input-output operations-intensive jobs for which CPUs were designed.\nBut at the time, HPC was a niche, and Wall Street worried that CUDA would distract Nvidia from its core market. And back in the early 2000s, Moore\u2019s Law still had some life left in it; it wasn\u2019t until the 2010s where it grew apparent Moore\u2019s Law hit the wall and that GPUs or multicore would be the only ways forward.\nFor CUDA, the watershed was the 2012 AlexNet project, an experiment with using convolutional neural networks or CNNs for image recognition. The CNN, trained on Nvidia GTX 580 3GB GPUs using CUDA, outclassed the competition with the lowest error rate. The AlexNet research paper was downloaded more than 100,000 times, putting CUDA on the map. Though alternatives to CUDA emerged, in the early 2010s those multipurpose libraries were no match for CUDA\u2019s bespoke design.\nAlexNet vindicated Nvidia\u2019s move up the food chain with CUDA to technical computing. But in the early 2010s, deep learning and neural nets were still the stuff of bleeding edge. Nvidia transcended its gamer niche for a more extensible one, but at the time, it was still a niche.\nAttention is all Nvidia needed\nUpon winning the AlexNet competition, Nvidia elevated AI front and center to its message. But here\u2019s the rub. As noted, image or voice recognition, or any form of neural net, was still early stage as a market. Instead, the 2010s were the decade of Big Data, and when it came to AI, machine learning was far ahead of deep learning in the queue.\nData and ML are both IOPS-intensive processes that worked just fine if you could scale out to enough commodity hardware; GPUs were overkill for these workloads. Not surprisingly, during the Big Data decade, the AWSs, Azures and Googles \u2013 but not Nvidia \u2013 cleaned up.\nBut then came Google\u2019s seminal 2017 Attention Is All You Need research paper that, eventually, gave Nvidia all the attention it needed. The transformer pattern introduced in that paper made generative AI feasible because it provided a shortcut around traditional neutral net processing. A year earlier, Nvidia custom built its first DGX supercomputer that it provided to Open AI. And about five years later plus or minus came ChatGPT, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re having this conversation.\nDuring this period, CUDA\u2019s breadth and maturity drove native support from deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Theano and MXNet. The portfolio of functions grew from Nvidia and from partner content. Having built these libraries over 20 years, there\u2019s now a whole generation of AI developers coding to them. AMD and Intel have grand leapfrog plans get their new state of the art fabs online. However, unless they are catering to developers new to AI, the AMDs and Intels of the world had better get darn good at writing emulators.\nCUDA is just the start\nWhile CUDA is the hook for developers, it is actually the tip of the iceberg for an expanding Nvidia proprietary ecosystem of tooling and libraries. Admittedly, you can develop programs to run Nvidia H100s without any of these layers, but the company is adding amenities to keep coders productive and evolve the whole stack into a supercomputing platform.\u00a0It starts with the popular RAPIDS open-source software libraries and APIs for data science, complemented with the NeMo developer platform tools for curating tokens at the trillions scale; a choice of different preconfigured distributing computation patterns; a library of pretrained models that can be customized with built-in prompt engineering and fine tuning tools; and integration with Nvidia\u2019s own Triton inference server.\nAtop that is a new layer of microservices that is Nvidia\u2019s play for the application tier. Nvidia Inference Microservices or NIMs is a set of optimized cloud-native\u00a0microservices for embedding models written for the Nvidia stack. It encompasses standard APIs for language, speech, drug discovery and other patterns, with prebuilt containers and Helm charts packaged with optimized models. With these microservices, models executing on Nvidia systems can be embedded into enterprise applications.\nAlready, third parties are packaging their own NIMs for deployment, such as Adobe Inc. with PDF extraction services, SAP SE for extending its Joule copilot, and ServiceNow Inc. for smart assistants. Nvidia customers can mix and match these services individually or license them as a package with Nvidia AI Enterprise, which adds the ability to manage all of these development and deployment services as a whole. It\u2019s available in editions that are deployed at the server and/or at the edge.\nAnd that\u2019s just what\u2019s on top. Getting back to chips, Nvidia\u2019s models are getting more intricate than ever. Its\u00a0Nvidia GB200 Grace Blackwell \u201cSuperchip\u201d\u00a0connects two\u00a0Nvidia B200 Tensor Core GPUs to the Nvidia Grace CPU over a 900-gigabit-per-second ultra-low-power NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect.\nAnd this is all packaged into an integrated supercomputer: Nvidia DGX\u00a0(pictured). It provides a self-contained data center that can be deployed as a hybrid cloud on-premises or as a service on AWS, Azure, Google or Oracle clouds. According to published reports, Nvidia nearly tripled its future commitments with each of the hyperscalers for its DGX cloud service since January. DGX includes base command as the management tier, providing all the necessary job scheduling, orchestration, network and cluster management functions. And like a Russian doll, DGX bundles Nvidia AI Enterprise \u2013 the full software stack.\nSo what\u2019s the deal with the mainframe?\nIBM Corp. dominated enterprise computing during the heyday of the mainframe. That era was all about the hardware, with software treated as an afterthought: Enterprise MIS departments (they weren\u2019t called IT yet) either wrote their own programs or hired consultants to do it, or programs were bundled with the box. Commercially packaged software did not yet exist. Software was written on the specific hardware platform, and though emulators existed, they were no substitutes for the real thing.\nAdmittedly, IBM wasn\u2019t the only mainframe player in town, but the Honeywells, Sperry-Univacs, Control Datas and GEs eventually got relegated to the dustbins of history, and with it, all the programs written for them. A similar pattern emerged with the rise of the midrange in the 1970s and \u201980s, as software written for DEC wouldn\u2019t run on Prime or Data General machines, and today the bulk of that code is extinct.\nThe world today is not a carbon copy of the past. There are proprietary islands and multiplatform realities existing side by side. Obvious examples are Apple versus the rest of the world \u2013 Android in mobile and Windows on laptops. But the abstractions are high enough, not to mention that having only two primary ecosystems makes life very manageable for mobile and laptop developers to develop for just two target platforms.\nOn the other hand, the server has become the domain of open systems with Linux becoming the de facto standard and software portability across hardware taken for granted. Likewise, thanks to robust W3C standards, web apps should run on any browser.\nBut still, neural networks and gen AI are different matters. Given the ravenous appetite for compute, any loss in performance when translating to another hardware platform is just not acceptable; the risks are too high.\nAs noted, it\u2019s not simply that Nvidia has carved an overwhelming lead in infrastructure (even though ironically it doesn\u2019t actually manufacture anything). But Nvidia offers a fully optimized stack rendering it difficult if not impossible to gain comparable performance elsewhere without serious coding rewrite or refactoring. Admittedly, developers could take architectural approaches to abstract the algorithm from the platform, but that requires added labor and forethought up front. And given the stringent performance requirements for generative or neural net AI models, bespoke optimization for the processor could be a major gating factor to model success.\nThat said, nature abhors a vacuum. This Medium post provides a well-documented look at Nvidia\u2019s competitive landscape as of 2023. It concludes that Nvidia currently has a monopoly, but there are potential threats lurking.\nFor instance, there has been a number of attempts over the years to generalize the interface with GPUs dating back to the OpenCL project created by Apple in 2008; surprise, surprise, it can actually run on CUDA. More recently, the Linux Foundation jumped in with the Unified Acceleration Foundation or UXL project, a standard framework that should allow developers to write code that can run cross-platform. With UXL, a model developed for running on AMD\u2019s ROCm should also target Intel\u2019s oneAPI without code changes, and so on.\nAnd there have been moves from the likes of Google and Microsoft for enabling support of various rival proprietary and open frameworks on infrastructure from second sources such as AMD. By the way, as enterprises look to more compact, domain-specific smaller language models, that could open doors for alternative platforms that won\u2019t have to be the most powerful on the planet.\nThe laws of supply and demand could catch up with Nvidia, once supply catches up, of course. But for now don\u2019t hold your breath. Intel won\u2019t be live with its new state of the fabs until 2027 and it will also likely take a few years for AMD and Apple to similarly scale up. There\u2019s growing support for CUDA alternatives, such as popular frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow supporting alternatives like ROCm.\nHyperscale cloud providers, of course, offer their own silicon specialized for training and inference workloads. And while hyperscalers want to remain in Nvidia\u2019s good graces, their chief priority remains selling compute cycles. Hyperscalers will book capacity for whatever their customers demand.\nNonetheless, in the near term, Nvidia\u2019s biggest worry is about keeping Wall Street in line as its multiples next year are likely to flatten owing to a likely hangover of customer capital spend. For now, Nvidia\u2019s worry isn\u2019t about developers defecting to less costly platforms. Nvidia AI Enterprise remains far more complete than anything else out there, not to mention that most large AI programs are written for the CUDA libraries. Though it is an expensive, intricate platform, Nvidia today has the same built-in defensibility of the classic mainframe.\nTony Baer is principal at\u00a0dbInsight LLC, which provides an independent view on the database and analytics technology ecosystem.\u00a0Baer is an industry expert in extending data management practices, governance and advanced analytics to address the desire of enterprises to generate meaningful value from data-driven transformation.

It's inevitable regardless of the sector or industry.\nNo company has been as visibly successful of late as Nvidia (NVDA -2.11%). Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are selling faster than the company can ship them. Nvidia's share price has more than tripled over the last 12 months.\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia's success is attracting increased competition. And it's not just from other major chipmakers. Several of Nvidia's biggest customers that are cloud service providers -- Amazon, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Microsoft -- have their own artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\nIs Nvidia worried about the threat from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft? Based on CEO Jensen Huang's recent comments, the answer is a hard \"no.\" Huang was asked by an analyst in the first-quarter earnings conference call to what extent Nvidia views its large cloud customers as competitors. He replied without any hesitation that Nvidia is different from these potential rivals in the following three key ways. \n\n1. The richness of its accelerated computing architecture\nHuang said in the Q1 call that the first way Nvidia differentiates itself from the technology of the large cloud service providers is through the \"richness\" of its accelerated computing architecture. He emphasized that customers can use this architecture for practically all of their AI needs, including training models and inference.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also noted that AI inference has \"fundamentally changed.\" Instead of pattern recognition such as identifying a cat, large language models (LLMs) are now used to generate images. Nvidia hasn't skipped a beat with this shift.\nHuang argued that customers can use Nvidia \"for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing.\" He added that computing costs and energy usage have soared \"because general-purpose computing has run its course.\" In his view, the only viable alternative for the future is accelerated computing. And Huang thinks Nvidia's accelerated computing platform gives data center customers the lowest total cost of ownership.\n2. Nvidia is everywhere\nYou won't see AI chips developed by Amazon used on cloud platforms other than Amazon Web Services. It's the same story for chips developed by other cloud service providers. Huang said, though, that Nvidia's chips are \"in every cloud.\"\nHe thinks that makes Nvidia an obvious choice for AI developers. This could especially be a selling point for organizations that use multiple clouds.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not just the cloud. Huang emphasized that Nvidia's technology is \"practically everywhere.\" The company has chips for on-premises servers, too. As Huang noted, \"We're in computers of any size and shape.\" This pervasive presence gives Nvidia a leg up on Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.\n3. Building AI factories\nHuang's third reason Nvidia is different from rivals and potential rivals is that the company builds \"AI factories.\" He often uses this term to describe a new type of data center that uses accelerated computing to build AI applications. \nAI factories include chips but aren't limited to chips. They aren't limited to single LLMs, either. These factories encompass the entire system for training and running AI apps.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the Q1 call that the company worked with more than 100 customers in the first quarter to build AI factories. She noted that some of them included \"tens of thousands of GPUs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company's new Blackwell platform should differentiate Nvidia's AI factory approach even more. Blackwell supports training LLMs four times faster than the H100 GPU with 30 times faster inference. Kress specifically noted that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are already lined up to use Blackwell as well as others including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and XAi.\nShould Nvidia be worried?\nHuang is absolutely correct that Nvidia is different from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft in several ways. He's also right that these differences give Nvidia important competitive advantages. But should Nvidia be worried about the threat from its big customers anyway? I think at least some concern is warranted.\nAmazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos stated in the past, \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" Nvidia's gross margin in Q1 was 78.4%, up from 64.6% in the prior-year period. Its net profit margin was 57%, more than double the same period in the previous fiscal year. Those margins don't just present an opportunity for Amazon; they're tantalizing for Google, Microsoft, and others as well.\nI expect Nvidia's investments in research and development will keep the company on top in the AI chip market for years to come. However, it doesn't hurt to worry about competition to some extent.

But the hype isn\u2019t dying down anytime soon.by  Nicole NareaJun 26, 2024, 8:50 PM UTCFacebookLinkNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024, in San Jose, California.  Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesNicole Narea covers politics Vox. She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.When a fan asked Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to sign her chest earlier this month, that might have been a sign that the hype around the chipmaker may have reached unsustainable heights. Over the past few years, Nvidia\u2019s computer chips \u2014 which have some technical capabilities that make them well suited to AI applications \u2014 catapulted the company to new echelons of profitability. Last week, Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable company; three days later, it lost that title amid a days-long sell-off of its shares. While its stock price has since recovered somewhat, it\u2019s now the world\u2019s third most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, after Microsoft and Apple. The sell-off came amid concern that Nvidia is overvalued. Recently, financial research strategist Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank warned of \u201csigns of over-exuberance\u201d about Nvidia, and Nvidia executives have even sold off some of their holdings in the company.There are still many reasons to be excited about Nvidia: The company has established itself as an industry-leading chipmaker, reaping the benefits of an early bet on AI that has paid off as chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT have brought broader public attention to the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s very early in the AI race,\u201d said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech research and analysis firm. \u201cBut everyone who has been building AI up to this point probably has done at least some of their most important work on Nvidia.\u201dThe stock market has responded accordingly. Nvidia is part of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech stocks that accounted for a majority of stock market growth last year. Its stock price had risen nearly 155 percent since January as of the market closing on Wednesday.But whether Nvidia can continue to replicate that kind of growth depends on advancements in AI, as well as to what extent \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 businesses will adopt it. How Nvidia became one of the world\u2019s most important chipmakersNvidia has long been considered the premier producer of graphics cards for gaming. However, its graphics processing units (GPUs), the main component of graphics cards, gained popularity amid a rise in cryptocurrency mining, a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems to release new cryptocurrency coins into circulation.That\u2019s because Nvidia GPUs are highly optimized for what\u2019s called \u201cparallel processing\u201d \u2014 basically, dividing up a computationally difficult problem and assigning the various parts to thousands of processor cores on the GPU at once, solving the problem more quickly and efficiently than traditional computing methods. As it turns out, generative AI also relies on parallel processing. Whenever you query ChatGPT, for example, the AI model has to parse big data sets \u2014 the sum total of the world\u2019s text-based online content as of ChatGPT\u2019s last knowledge update \u2014 to answer you. To do so in real time and on the scale that companies like OpenAI hope to build out requires parallel processing performed at data centers that house thousands of GPUs. Nvidia realized what it stood to gain from the GPU needs of generative AI early on. Huang has referred to 2018 as a \u201cbet the company moment\u201d in which Nvidia reimagined the GPU for AI, well before ChatGPT came on the scene. The company structured its research and development and mergers and acquisitions strategies to benefit from a coming AI boom.\u201cThey were playing the game when nobody else was,\u201d Newman said.In addition to offering GPUs optimized for that purpose, Nvidia created a programming model and parallel computing platform called the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) that has become the industry standard. This software has made the capabilities of Nvidia GPUs more accessible to developers.So even as Nvidia\u2019s competitors like AMD and Intel have come to introduce similar offerings, even at lower price points, Nvidia has retained the lion\u2019s share of the GPU market for businesses, in part because developers have gotten used to CUDA and don\u2019t want to switch.\u201cWhat [Nvidia] understood very early on is if you want to win in hardware, you got to win in software,\u201d Newman said. \u201cA lot of the developers that are building apps for AI have built them and been comfortable building them using CUDA and running it on Nvidia hardware.\u201dAll of that has positioned Nvidia to capitalize on the ever-growing needs of generative AI.Can Nvidia keep the good times rolling?Nvidia\u2019s competitors likely don\u2019t pose any immediate threat to its status as an industry leader. \u201cIn the long run, we expect tech titans to strive to find second sources or in-house solutions to diversify away from Nvidia in AI, but most likely, these efforts will chip away at, but not supplant, Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance,\u201d Brian Colello, a strategist for Morningstar, wrote in a recent report. However, Nvidia\u2019s ability to sustain the level of growth it has seen in the last year is tied to the future of generative AI and to what extent it can be monetized. Anyone can currently access ChatGPT for free, though a $20 monthly subscription fee will give you access to its latest and greatest version. But individual subscribers are not currently where the real money is. Rather, it\u2019s with businesses. And at this point, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how companies will integrate generative AI into their business models in the coming years. For Nvidia\u2019s growth to be sustainable, major companies like Salesforce or Oracle \u2014 which sell software to enterprises \u2014 will have to offer new software that will \u201cconsume tons of AI\u201d to the point that these large companies are signing annual contracts that give them access to the greatest amount of computing power, Newman said.\u201cOtherwise, that central thesis of standing up these massive megawatt data centers all over the world full of GPUs becomes a bit of a risk.\u201d So should you buy Nvidia stock? It depends on how bullish you are about AI and its ability to penetrate the economy.\u201cWe think Nvidia\u2019s prospects will be tied to the AI market, for better or worse, for quite some time,\u201d Collelo writes.See More: Artificial IntelligenceBig DataBig TechBusiness & FinanceEmerging TechExplainersInnovationLiving in an AI worldMoneyPrivacy & SecurityStock marketTechnologyTechnology & MediaMost PopularThis is why Kamala Harris really lostWhat can be done if Trump is openly defying the courts?Take a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordThe alarmingly high stakes in an easy Supreme Court voting rights caseMeasles is back \u2014 and more dangerous than you think.

Moore12 Jun 20244 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.Nvidia's predominance in GPU systems for AI training continues in the latest MLPerf set of AI benchmarks. \n        Nvidia\n    \n\tFor years, Nvidia has dominated many machine learning benchmarks, and now there are two more notches in its belt.\nMLPerf, the AI benchmarking suite sometimes called \u201cthe Olympics of machine learning,\u201d has released a new set of training tests to help make more and better apples-to-apples comparisons between competing computer systems. One of MLPerf\u2019s new tests concerns fine-tuning of large language models, a process that takes an existing trained model and trains it a bit more with specialized knowledge to make it fit for a particular purpose. The other is for graph neural networks, a type of machine learning behind some literature databases, fraud detection in financial systems, and social networks.\n\n\tEven with the additions and the participation of computers using Google\u2019s and Intel\u2019s\u00a0AI accelerators, systems powered by Nvidia\u2019s Hopper architecture dominated the results once again. One system that included 11,616 Nvidia H100 GPUs\u2014the largest collection yet\u2014topped each of the nine benchmarks, setting records in five of them (including the two new benchmarks).\n\n\t\u201cIf you just throw hardware at the problem, it\u2019s not a given that you\u2019re going to improve.\u201d \u2014Dave Salvator, Nvidia\n\tThe 11,616-H100 system is \u201cthe biggest we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Dave Salvator, director of accelerated computing products at Nvidia. It smashed through the GPT-3 training trial in less than 3.5 minutes. A 512-GPU system, for comparison, took about 51 minutes. (Note that the GPT-3 task is not a full training, which could take weeks and cost millions of dollars. Instead, the computers train on a representative portion of the data, at an agreed-upon point well before completion.)\n\n\tCompared to Nvidia\u2019s largest entrant on GPT-3 last year, a 3,584 H100 computer, the 3.5-minute result represents a 3.2-fold improvement. You might expect that just from the difference in the size of these systems, but in AI computing that isn\u2019t always the case, explains Salvator. \u201cIf you just throw hardware at the problem, it\u2019s not a given that you\u2019re going to improve,\u201d he says.\n\n\t\u201cWe are getting essentially linear scaling,\u201d says Salvator. By that he means that twice as many GPUs lead to a halved training time. \u201c[That] represents a great achievement from our engineering teams,\u201d he adds.\n\n\tCompetitors are also getting closer to linear scaling. This round Intel deployed a system using 1,024 GPUs that performed the GPT-3 task in 67 minutes versus a computer one-fourth the size that took 224 minutes six months ago. Google\u2019s largest GPT-3 entry used 12-times the number of TPU v5p accelerators as its smallest entry and performed its task nine times as fast.\n\n\tLinear scaling is going to be particularly important for upcoming \u201cAI factories\u201d housing 100,000 GPUs or more, Salvator says. He says to expect one such data center to come online this year, and another, using Nvidia\u2019s next architecture, Blackwell, to startup in 2025.\nNvidia\u2019s streak continues\n\tNvidia continued to boost training times despite using the same architecture, Hopper, as it did in last year\u2019s training results. That\u2019s all down to software improvements, says Salvator. \u201cTypically, we\u2019ll get a 2-2.5x [boost] from software after a new architecture is released,\u201d he says.\n\n\tFor GPT-3 training, Nvidia logged a 27 percent improvement from the June 2023 MLPerf benchmarks. Salvator says there were several software changes behind the boost. For example, Nvidia engineers tuned up Hopper\u2019s use of less accurate, 8-bit floating point operations by trimming unnecessary conversions between 8-bit and 16-bit numbers and better targeting of which layers of a neural network could use the lower precision number format. They also found a more intelligent way to adjust the power budget of each chip\u2019s compute engines, and sped communication among GPUs in a way that Salvator likened to \u201cbuttering your toast while it\u2019s still in the toaster.\u201d\n\n\tAdditionally, the company implemented a scheme called flash attention. Invented in the Stanford University laboratory of Samba Nova founder Chris Re, flash attention is an algorithm that speeds transformer networks by minimizing writes to memory. When it first showed up in MLPerf benchmarks, flash attention shaved as much as 10 percent from training times. (Intel, too, used a version of flash attention but not for GPT-3. It instead used the algorithm for one of the new benchmarks, fine-tuning.)\n\n\tUsing other software and network tricks, Nvidia delivered an 80 percent speedup in the text-to-image test, Stable Diffusion, versus its submission in November 2023.\nNew benchmarks\n\tMLPerf adds new benchmarks and upgrades old ones to stay relevant to what\u2019s happening in the AI industry. This year saw the addition of fine-tuning and graph neural networks.\n\n\tFine tuning takes an already trained LLM and specializes it for use in a particular field. Nvidia, for example took a trained 43-billion-parameter model and trained it on the GPU-maker\u2019s design files and documentation to create ChipNeMo, an AI intended to boost the productivity of its chip designers. At the time, the company\u2019s chief technology officer Bill Dally said that training an LLM was like giving it a liberal arts education, and fine tuning was like sending it to graduate school.\n\n\tThe MLPerf benchmark takes a pretrained Llama-2-70B model and asks the system to fine tune it using a dataset of government documents with the goal of generating more accurate document summaries.\n\n\tThere are several ways to do fine-tuning. MLPerf chose one called low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The method winds up training only a small portion of the LLM\u2019s parameters leading to a 3-fold lower burden on hardware and reduced use of memory and storage versus other methods, according to the organization.\n\n\tThe other new benchmark involved a graph neural network (GNN). These are for problems that can be represented by a very large set of interconnected nodes, such as a social network or a recommender system. Compared to other AI tasks, GNNs require a lot of communication between nodes in a computer.\n\n\tThe benchmark trained a GNN on a database that shows relationships about academic authors, papers, and institutes\u2014a graph with 547 million nodes and 5.8 billion edges. The neural network was then trained to predict the right label for each node in the graph.\nFuture fights\n\tTraining rounds in 2025 may see head-to-head contests comparing new accelerators from AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. AMD\u2019s MI300 series was launched about six months ago, and a memory-boosted upgrade the MI325x is planned for the end of 2024, with the next generation MI350 slated for 2025. Intel says its Gaudi 3, generally available to computer makers later this year, will appear in MLPerf\u2019s upcoming inferencing benchmarks. Intel executives have said the new chip has the capacity to beat H100 at training LLMs. But the victory may be short-lived, as Nvidia has unveiled a new architecture, Blackwell, which is planned for late this year.\nFrom Your Site Articlesmlperf - IEEE Spectrum \u203aGoogle, Intel, Nvidia Battle in Generative AI Training \u203aChip Manufacturing: Using AI Tools to Reduce Carbon Emissions - IEEE Spectrum \u203aRelated Articles Around the Webmlcommons/inference: Reference implementations of ... - GitHub \u203aMLCommons | Machine Learning Innovation \u203atrainingartificial intelligencelarge language modelsllmsnvidiaintelgooglefine-tuninggraph neural networksgpt-3stable diffusionmlperfSamuel K.

With the Llama 3 NIM for intelligent assistants and NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM microservices for digital biology, researchers can build and scale end-to-end workflows for drug discovery and clinical trials.\nDeloitte is driving efficiency for garnering data-based insights from gene to function for research copilots, scientific research mining, chemical property prediction and drug repurposing with its Atlas AI drug discovery accelerator, powered by the NVIDIA BioNeMo, NeMo and Llama 3 NIM microservices.\nTranscripta Bio harnesses Llama 3 and BioNeMo for accelerated intelligent drug discovery. Its proprietary artificial intelligence modeling suite, Conductor AI, uses its Drug-Gene Atlas to help discover and predict the effects of new drugs at transcriptome scale.\nBolstering Clinical Trials\nQuantiphi \u2014 an AI-first digital engineering company and an Elite Service Delivery Partner in the NVIDIA Partner Network \u2014 is using NVIDIA NIM to develop generative AI solutions for clinical research and development, diagnostics and patient care. These innovations are enabling organizations to save substantial cost, enhance workforce productivity and improve patient outcomes.\nConcertAI is advancing a broad set of translational and clinical development solutions within its CARA AI platform. The company has integrated the Llama 3 NIM to support population-scale patient matching to clinical trials, study automation and research site copilots with real-time insights and model management for large-scale AI applications.\nMendel AI is developing clinically focused AI solutions that can understand nuances in medical data at scale to provide actionable insights, with applications across clinical research, real-world evidence generation and cohort selection. It has deployed a fine-tuned Llama 3 NIM for its Hypercube copilot, offering a 36% performance improvement. Mendel is also exploring potential use cases with Llama 3 NIM to extract clinical information from patient records and to translate natural language into clinical queries.\nImproving Digital Surgery\nThe operating room is bolstered by AI and the latest digital technologies, too.\nActiv Surgical is using Llama 3 to accelerate development of its AI copilot and augmented-reality solution for real-time surgical guidance. The company\u2019s ActivSight technology, which allows surgeons to view critical physiological structures and functions, aims to reduce surgical complication rates, improving patient care and safety.\nEnhancing Digital Health\nGenerative AI-powered digital health applications enhance patient-doctor interactions, helping to improve patient outcomes and deliver more efficient healthcare.\nPrecision medicine company SimBioSys recently downloaded the Llama 3 NIM to help analyze a breast cancer patient\u2019s diagnosis and tailor guidance for the physician regarding the patient\u2019s unique characteristics.\nArtisight, a startup focused on smart hospital transformation, uses Llama 3 to automate documentation and care coordination in all its clinical locations with ambient voice and vision systems.\nAITEM, which offers medical and veterinary AI diagnostic solutions, is building healthcare-specific chatbots with the model.\nAnd Abridge, which offers a generative AI platform for clinical conversations, is using the NIM to build a physician-patient encounter summarization solution.\nTranscripta Bio, Activ Surgical, SimBioSys, Artisight, AITEM and Abridge are all members of NVIDIA Inception, a free program that helps startups evolve faster through cutting-edge technology, opportunities to connect with venture capitalists and access to the latest technical resources from NVIDIA.\nThe NVIDIA NIM collection of inference microservices is available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a software platform that streamlines development and deployment of production-grade copilots and other generative AI applications.\nDownload the Meta Llama 3 NIM now and learn more about how generative AI is reshaping healthcare and other industries by joining NVIDIA at COMPUTEX, running through June 7 in Taipei, Taiwan.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s COMPUTEX keynote in replay:\n\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | COMPUTEX 2024 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Inference | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Using an AI supercomputer featuring 11,616 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs connected with NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking, NVIDIA\u00a0 achieved this remarkable feat through larger scale \u2014 more than triple that of the 3,584 H100 GPU submission a year ago \u2014 and extensive full-stack engineering.\n\nThanks to the scalability of the NVIDIA AI platform, Eos can now train massive AI models like GPT-3 175B even faster, and this great AI performance translates into significant business opportunities. For example, in NVIDIA\u2019s recent earnings call, we described how LLM service providers can turn a single dollar invested into seven dollars in just four years running the Llama 3 70B model on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers. This return assumes an LLM service provider serving Llama 3 70B at $0.60/M tokens, with an HGX H200 server throughput of 24,000 tokens/second.\nNVIDIA H200 GPU Supercharges Generative AI and HPC\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA H200 Tensor GPU builds upon the strength of the Hopper architecture, with 141GB of HBM3 memory and over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100 GPU. Pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in AI training, the NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPU extended the H100\u2019s performance by up to 47% in its MLPerf Training debut.\nNVIDIA Software Drives Unmatched Performance Gains\nAdditionally, our submissions using a 512 H100 GPU configuration are now up to 27% faster compared to just one year ago due to numerous optimizations to the NVIDIA software stack. This improvement highlights how continuous software enhancements can significantly boost performance, even with the same hardware.\nThis work also delivered nearly perfect scaling. As the number of GPUs increased by 3.2x \u2014 going from 3,584 H100 GPUs last year to 11,616 H100 GPUs with this submission \u2014 so did the delivered performance.\nLearn more about these optimizations on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\nExcelling at LLM Fine-Tuning\nAs enterprises seek to customize pretrained large language models, LLM fine-tuning is becoming a key industry workload. MLPerf introduced a new LLM fine-tuning benchmark this round, based on the popular low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique applied to Meta Llama 2 70B.\nThe NVIDIA platform excelled at this task, scaling from eight to 1,024 GPUs, with the largest-scale NVIDIA submission completing the benchmark in a record 1.5 minutes.\nAccelerating Stable Diffusion and GNN Training\nNVIDIA also accelerated Stable Diffusion v2 training performance by up to 80% at the same system scales submitted last round. These advances reflect numerous enhancements to the NVIDIA software stack, showcasing how software and hardware improvements go hand-in-hand to deliver top-tier performance.\nOn the new graph neural network (GNN) test based on R-GAT, the NVIDIA platform with H100 GPUs excelled at both small and large scales. The H200 delivered a 47% boost on single-node GNN training compared to the H100. This showcases the powerful performance and high efficiency of NVIDIA GPUs, which make them ideal for a wide range of AI applications.\nBroad Ecosystem Support\nReflecting the breadth of the NVIDIA AI ecosystem, 10 NVIDIA partners submitted results, including ASUS, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Oracle, Quanta Cloud Technology, Supermicro and Sustainable Metal Cloud. This broad participation, and their own impressive benchmark results, underscores the widespread adoption and trust in NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform across the industry.\nMLCommons\u2019 ongoing work to bring benchmarking best practices to AI computing is vital. By enabling peer-reviewed comparisons of AI and HPC platforms, and keeping pace with the rapid changes that characterize AI computing, MLCommons provides companies everywhere with crucial data that can help guide important purchasing decisions.\nAnd with the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, next-level AI performance on trillion-parameter generative AI models for both training and inference is coming soon.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Hardware | Networking | SoftwareTags: NVIDIA Hopper Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Taking a deep breath, she noticed that there was no city noise, no pollution \u2014 and no work emails.\nAshtankar, a senior tools development engineer in NVIDIA\u2019s Pune, India, office, took advantage of the company\u2019s free days \u2014 two extra days off per quarter when the whole company disconnects from work \u2014 to recharge. Free days are fully paid by NVIDIA, not counted as vacation or as personal time off, and are in addition to country-specific holidays and time-away programs.\n\nFree days give employees time to take an adventure, a breather \u2014 or both. Ashtankar and her husband, Dipen Sisodia \u2014 also an NVIDIAN \u2014 spent it outdoors, hiking up a mountain, playing in snow and exploring forests and lush green meadows.\n\u201cMy free days give me time to focus on myself and recharge,\u201d said Ashtankar. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take our laptops. We were able to completely disconnect, like all NVIDIANs were doing at the same time.\u201d\n\nAshtankar returned to work feeling refreshed and recharged, she said. Her team tests software features of NVIDIA products, focusing on GPU display drivers and the GeForce NOW game-streaming service, to make sure bugs are found and addressed before a product reaches customers.\n\u201cI take pride in tackling challenges with the highest level of quality and creativity, all in support of delivering the best products to our customers,\u201d she said. \u201cTo do that, sometimes the most productive thing we can do is rest and let the soul catch up with the body.\u201d\nAshtankar plans to build her career at NVIDIA for many years to come.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of another company that truly cares this much about its employees,\u201d she said.\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers. \n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It also makes NIM widely available through platforms from dozens of companies, such as Canonical, Nutanix and Red Hat.\nThe integration of NIM on KServe extends NVIDIA\u2019s technologies to the open-source community, ecosystem partners and customers. Through NIM, they can all access the performance, support and security of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform with an API call \u2014 the push-button of modern programming.\nServing AI on Kubernetes\nKServe got its start as part of Kubeflow, a machine learning toolkit based on Kubernetes, the open-source system for deploying and managing software containers that hold all the components of large distributed applications.\nAs Kubeflow expanded its work on AI inference, what became KServe was born and ultimately evolved into its own open-source project.\nMany companies have contributed to and adopted the KServe software that runs today at companies including AWS, Bloomberg, Canonical, Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Red Hat, Zillow and NVIDIA.\nUnder the Hood With KServe\nKServe is essentially an extension of Kubernetes that runs AI inference like a powerful cloud application. It uses a standard protocol, runs with optimized performance and supports PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and XGBoost without users needing to know the details of those AI frameworks.\nThe software is especially useful these days, when new large language models (LLMs) are emerging rapidly.\nKServe lets users easily go back and forth from one model to another, testing which one best suits their needs. And when an updated version of a model gets released, a KServe feature called \u201ccanary rollouts\u201d automates the job of carefully validating and gradually deploying it into production.\nAnother feature, GPU autoscaling, efficiently manages how models are deployed as demand for a service ebbs and flows, so customers and service providers have the best possible experience.\nAn API Call to Generative AI\nThe goodness of KServe is now available with the ease of NVIDIA NIM.\nWith NIM, a simple API call takes care of all the complexities. Enterprise IT admins get the metrics they need to ensure their application is running with optimal performance and efficiency, whether it\u2019s in their data center or on a remote cloud service \u2014 even if they change the AI models they\u2019re using.\nNIM lets IT professionals become generative AI pros, transforming their company\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why a host of enterprises such as Foxconn and ServiceNow are deploying NIM microservices.\nNIM Rides Dozens of Kubernetes Platforms\nThanks to its integration with KServe, users will be able access NIM on dozens of enterprise platforms such as Canonical\u2019s Charmed KubeFlow and Charmed Kubernetes, Nutanix GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift AI and many others.\n\u201cRed Hat has been working with NVIDIA to make it easier than ever for enterprises to deploy AI using open source technologies,\u201d said KServe contributor Yuan Tang, a principal software engineer at Red Hat. \u201cBy enhancing KServe and adding support for NIM in Red Hat OpenShift AI, we\u2019re able to provide streamlined access to NVIDIA\u2019s generative AI platform for Red Hat customers.\u201d\n\u201cThrough the integration of NVIDIA NIM inference microservices with Nutanix GPT-in-a-Box 2.0, customers will be able to build scalable, secure, high-performance generative AI applications in a consistent way, from the cloud to the edge,\u201d said the vice president of engineering at Nutanix, Debojyoti Dutta, whose team contributes to KServe and Kubeflow.\n\u201cAs a company that also contributes significantly to KServe, we\u2019re pleased to offer NIM through Charmed Kubernetes and Charmed Kubeflow,\u201d said Andreea Munteanu, MLOps product manager at Canonical. \u201cUsers will be able to access the full power of generative AI, with the highest performance, efficiency and ease thanks to the combination of our efforts.\u201d\nDozens of other software providers can feel the benefits of NIM simply because they include KServe in their offerings.\nServing the Open-Source Community\nNVIDIA has a long track record on the KServe project. As noted in a recent technical blog, KServe\u2019s Open Inference Protocol is used in NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, which helps users run many AI models simultaneously across many GPUs, frameworks and operating modes.\nWith KServe, NVIDIA focuses on use cases that involve running one AI model at a time across many GPUs.\nAs part of the NIM integration, NVIDIA plans to be an active contributor to KServe, building on its portfolio of contributions to open-source software that includes Triton and TensorRT-LLM. NVIDIA is also an active member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which supports open-source code for generative AI and other projects.\nTry the NIM API on the NVIDIA API Catalog using the Llama 3 8B or Llama 3 70B LLM models today. Hundreds of NVIDIA partners worldwide are using NIM to deploy generative AI.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s COMPUTEX keynote to get the latest on AI and more.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | COMPUTEX 2024 | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her mom, despite earning a computer science degree in the U.S., trained to become a home health aide, where jobs were more available.\n\u201cMy parents\u2019 resilience and courage made my life possible,\u201d Miller said.\nAfter graduating from Ramapo College of New Jersey with a degree in international business, Miller worked at large automotive companies in client support, production support and project management.\nNow working as a technical program manager in product security at NVIDIA, she feels like her family\u2019s journey has come full circle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the honor of my life being here at NVIDIA: I\u2019m the proudest refugee,\u201d she said.\nIn her role, Miller functions like a conductor in an orchestra. She works with engineers to bridge gaps and understand challenges to define solutions \u2014 always trying to create opportunities to turn a \u201cno\u201d into a \u201cyes\u201d through collaboration.\nAt NVIDIA, Miller feels like she can be herself, helping her thrive. She no longer feels the pressure to conform to fit in, allowing her creativity to flow freely and solve problems.\n\u201cPreviously in my career, I never wore my hair curly. After someone once asked to touch my curly hair, I believed it would be easier to make myself look like everyone else. I thought it was the best way to let my work be the focus instead of my hair,\u201d she said. \u201cNVIDIA is the first employer that encouraged me to bring my full self to work.\u201d\n\nOutside of work, Miller and her husband, Nathan, are passionate about paying it forward and helping local youth in Trenton, New Jersey. Together, they\u2019ve developed The Miller Family Foundation to help with community needs, including education. The foundation\u2019s scholarship fund has donated $20,000 to low-income high school students to provide support for college tuition and career mentorship.\n\u201cI truly believe anyone could get here. There wasn\u2019t anyone that showed me the path. It was belief in myself, a ton of research and endless hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a special place where my husband and I can give the next generation some of the financial support and career guidance we didn\u2019t have.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA life, culture and careers.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: NVIDIA Life \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company has always had competition, from a variety of chip makers including giants such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, and startups such as Graphcore.The latest benchmark tests of speed, however, suggest Nvidia really has no competition, if competition means parties that meaningfully challenge the best the company can do.The MLCommons, the industry consortium that compiles multiple benchmark reports each year on AI chip performance, on Wednesday announced numbers for how different chips perform when training neural nets for a variety of tasks, including training Meta's Llama large language model to make predictions, and training the Stable Diffusion image model to produce pictures.\u00a0Nvidia swept the benchmarks, getting the top score, and also the second-best, in all nine competitions. Competitors such as AMD, Intel and Google's cloud computing division, didn't even come close.\u00a0Also: Nvidia sweeps AI benchmarks, but Intel brings meaningful competitionIt was the third time in a row that Nvidia had no competition for the top scores, but even the encouraging results of past rounds by competitors failed to materialize this time around.    MLCommonsThe Training 4.0 test, which totals nine separate tasks, records the time to tune a neural network by having its settings refined in multiple experiments. It is one half of neural network performance, the other half being so-called inference, where the finished neural network makes predictions as it receives new data. Inference is covered in separate releases from MLCommons.\u00a0Most of MLPerf's tasks are by now well-established neural nets that have been in development for years, such as 3-D U-Net, a program for studying volumetric data for things such as solid tumor detection, which was introduced by Google's DeepMind back in 2016.\u00a0However, MLCommons continues to periodically update the benchmarks with new tasks to reflect emerging workloads. This round of training was the first time the submitters competed on the time to \"fine-tune\" a version of Meta's Llama language model, where the AI model is retrained, after its initial training, by using a more focused training data set. Also added was a \"graph neural network\" task, training the neural net to traverse a set of associated data points, which can be useful for things such as drug discovery.    MLCommonsAlso: Nvidia teases Rubin GPUs and CPUs to succeed Blackwell in 2026In the test to fine-tune Meta's Llama 2 70B, Nvidia took just a minute and a half, with a collection of 1,024 of its \"H100\" GPU chips, a mainstream part currently powering AI workloads across the industry. The Nvidia chips scored the top twenty-three results, with Intel's \"Guadi\" AI accelerator showing up in twenty-fourth place.Even when adjusted for the number of chips, substantial challenges fail to materialize. In eight-chip configurations, for example, which is more common than a 1,024-chip system, as far as enterprises are concerned \u2014 a configuration where Intel had promising results last summer \u2014 Intel's best \u2014 and only \u2014 submission this time around was for the Llama 70B task.\u00a0It took Intel's system, aided by two of Intel's XEON CPUs, 78 minutes to fine-tune Llama. An 8-way Nvidia H100 system, aided by two of Advanced Micro Devices' EPYC processor, assembled by open-source vendor Red Hat, took less than half the time, just over 31 minutes.\u00a0In the test to train OpenAI's GPT-3 for things such as chat, Intel was able to use just 1,024 Gaudi chips, a tenth of the number of chips Nvidia used, 11,616 H100s. But Intel's score, 67 minutes, took more than twenty times as long to train as Nvidia's leading score, 3.4 minutes. Of course, some enterprises may find that a difference of an hour to train versus three minutes is negligible considering the cost savings of using far fewer chips, and given that much of the work in training AI models can be factors other than the strict wall-clock time to train, such as the time required for data prep.\u00a0Also: Intel shows off latest 'Gaudi' AI chip, pitched towards enterprisesOther vendors had an equally hard time catching Nvidia. On the venerable test of image recognition, with the neural net known as Resnet, Advanced Micro Devices took 167 minutes to train the network using six of its \"RADEON RX 7900 XTX\" accelerator chips, versus just 122 minutes for a six-way Nvidia \"GeForce RTX 4090\" system.\u00a0Google's four submissions of its \"TPU\" version 5 chip, all for the GPT-3 test, achieved scores far below Nvidia's, between 12 and 114 minutes to train versus Nvidia's 3.4 minutes. Past competitors such as Graphcore have since bowed out of the race.Also conspicuous in the results are Nvidia's dominance as a system vendor. All of its winning scores were made with systems engineered by Nvidia itself, even though a raft of system vendors participated, including Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Juniper Networks, and Lenovo.An interesting future development could be systems using Nvidia's \"Grace\" CPU. All of the chip results submitted, whether from Nvidia, Intel, AMD or Google, continue to use only one of two x86 CPUs, Intel's XEON or AMD's EPYC. With Nvidia aiming to sell more complete computing systems using Grace, it seems only a matter of time before the CPU gets joined with Nvidia's GPUs. That could have an interesting impact on Nvidia's already substantial lead.An interesting first this time around for the benchmark suite was the inclusion of a measurement of the energy consumed to train neural nets. The Singapore company Firmus Technologies featured results of its cloud platform, Sustainable Metal Cloud, running tens and hundreds of Nvidia H100s, and offered the total \"energy-to-train\" measured in Jules. Firmus, in fact, built two of the second-place scores won by Nvidia.To run the Llama 2 70B fine-tuning, for example, Firmus's cloud computing system took between 45 million and 46 million Jules to train the network using 512 H100 chips. That training run, took two minutes, a little longer than Nvidia's best time on its own. It required four times as much energy as an 8-chip system that took fifteen times as long to train, or, 29 minutes, demonstrating the remarkable increase in energy consumed with giant training systems.The cost of training AI has been a hot-button issue in recent years, both in terms of cost burden to companies in dollar terms, and the environmental burden. It remains to be seen whether other submitters to the MLPerf results will join Firmus in offering energy measurement in the next round of benchmarks. \u00a0 Editorial standards  Show Comments  \n          Log In to Comment\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \n      Trump axes AI staff and research funding, and scientists are worried\n      \n      Tech leaders sound alarm over DOGE's AI firings, impact on American talent pipeline\n      \n      Will synthetic data derail generative AI's momentum or be the breakthrough we need?\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Foxconn\u2019s engineers are defining processes and training robots in this virtual environment, so the physical plant can produce at high efficiency the next engine of accelerated computing, NVIDIA Blackwell HGX systems.\nTo design an optimal assembly line, factory engineers need to find the best placement for dozens of robotic arms, each weighing hundreds of pounds. To accurately monitor the overall process, they situate thousands of sensors, including many networked video cameras in a matrix to show plant operators all the right details.\nVirtual Factories Create Real Savings\nSuch challenges are why companies like Foxconn are increasingly creating virtual factories for simulation and testing.\n\u201cOur digital twin will guide us to new levels of automation and industrial efficiency, saving time, cost and energy,\u201d said Young Liu, chairman of the company that last year had revenues of nearly $200 billion.\nBased on its efforts so far, the company anticipates that it can increase the manufacturing efficiency of complex servers using the simulated plant, leading to significant cost savings and reducing kilowatt-hour usage by over 30% annually.\nFoxconn Teams With NVIDIA, Siemens\nFoxconn is building its digital twin with software from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio including Teamcenter and NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing 3D workflows and applications based on OpenUSD.\nNVIDIA and Siemens announced in March that they will connect Siemens Xcelerator applications to NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud API microservices. Foxconn will be among the first to employ the combined services, so its digital twin is physically accurate and visually realistic.\nEngineers will employ Teamcenter with Omniverse APIs to design robot work cells and assembly lines. Then they\u2019ll use Omniverse to pull all the 3D CAD elements into one virtual factory where their robots will be trained with NVIDIA Isaac Sim.\nRobots Attend a Virtual School\nA growing set of manufacturers is building digital twins to streamline factory processes. Foxconn is among the first to take the next step in automation \u2014 training their AI robots in the digital twin.\nInside the Foxconn virtual factory, robot arms from manufacturers such as Epson can learn how to see, grasp and move objects with NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator, a collection of NVIDIA-accelerated libraries and AI foundation models for robot arms.\nFor example, the robot arms may learn how to pick up a Blackwell server and place it on an autonomous mobile robot (AMR). The arms can use Isaac Manipulator\u2019s cuMotion to find inspection paths for products, even when objects are placed in the way.\nFoxconn\u2019s AMRs, from Taiwan\u2019s FARobot, will learn how to see and navigate the factory floor using NVIDIA Perceptor, software that helps them build a real-time 3D map that indicates any obstacles. The robot\u2019s routes are generated and optimized by NVIDIA cuOpt, a world-record holding route optimization microservice.\nUnlike many transport robots that need to stick to carefully drawn lines on the factory floor, these smart AMRs will navigate around obstacles to get wherever they need to go.\n\nA Global Trend to Industrial Digitization\nThe Guadalajara factory is just the beginning. Foxconn is starting to design digital twins of factories around the world, including one in Taiwan where it will manufacture electric buses.\nFoxconn is also deploying NVIDIA Metropolis, an application framework for smart cities and spaces, to give cameras on the shop floor AI-powered vision. That gives plant managers deeper insights into daily operations and opportunities to further streamline operations and improve worker safety.\nWith an estimated 10 million factories worldwide, the $46 trillion manufacturing sector is a rich field for industrial digitalization.\nDelta Electronics, MediaTek, MSI and Pegatron are among other top electronics makers revealed at COMPUTEX this week how they\u2019re using NVIDIA AI and Omniverse to build digital twins of their factories.\nLike Foxconn, they\u2019re racing to make their factories more agile, autonomous and sustainable to serve the demand for more than a billion smartphones, PCs and servers a year.\nA reference architecture shows how to develop factory digital twins\u00a0 with the NVIDIA AI and Omniverse platforms. And learn about the experiences of five companies doing this work.\nWatch NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s COMPUTEX keynote to get the latest on AI and more.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | COMPUTEX 2024 | Industrial and Manufacturing | Isaac | Omniverse \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

AI agents \u2014 driven by large language models (LLMs) \u2014 are being built that can talk and assist on warehouse floors to boost productivity and increase safety. And digital twins are helping manufacturers simulate and develop factories and AI-powered automation before being deployed in real factories.\nFoxconn and its Ingrasys subsidiary use NVIDIA Omniverse and Metropolis to build digital twins for factories, planning efficiency optimizations and worker safety improvement at a number of manufacturing sites. At COMPUTEX, Foxconn is showing how it uses digital twins to plan placements of many video cameras in factories to optimize its data capture for collecting key insights.\nBringing Generative AI to the Factory Floor\nGenerative AI is creating productivity leaps across industries. Researcher McKinsey forecasts that generative AI will deliver as much as $290 billion in value for the advanced manufacturing industry, while bringing $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy.\nAt GTC in March, NVIDIA launched NVIDIA NIM, a set of microservices designed to speed up generative AI deployment in enterprises. Supporting a wide range of AI models, it ensures seamless, scalable AI inferencing, on premises or in the cloud, using industry-standard application programming interfaces.\nBillions of IoT devices worldwide can tap into Metropolis and NVIDIA NIM for improvements in AI perception to enhance their capabilities.\nAdvancing Manufacturing With NVIDIA NIM\nLinker Vision, an AI vision insights specialist, is adopting NVIDIA NIM to assist factories in deploying AI agents that can respond to natural language queries.\nThe Taipei company uses NVIDIA Visual Insight Agent (VIA) in manufacturing environments for always-on video feed monitoring of factory floors. With user prompts, these ChatGPT-like systems can enable operators to ask for video of factory floors to be monitored for insights and safety alerts, like when workers are not wearing hardhats.\nOperators can ask questions and receive instant, context-aware responses from AI agents, which can tap into organizational knowledge via retrieval-augmented generation, an integration of AI that can enhance operational efficiency.\nLeading manufacturer Pegatron has factories that span more than 20 million square feet and the facilities process and build more than 15 million assemblies per month, while deploying more than 3,500 robots across factory floors. It has announced efforts based on NVIDIA NIM and is using Metropolis multi-camera tracking reference workflows to help with worker safety and productivity on factory lines. Pegatron\u2019s workflow fuses digital twins in Omniverse and Metropolis real-time AI to better monitor and optimize operations.\nBoosting Automated Visual Inspections\nAdoption of NVIDIA Metropolis is helping Taiwan\u2019s largest electronics manufacturers streamline operations and reduce cost as they build and inspect some of the world\u2019s most complex and high-volume products.\nQuality control with manual inspections in manufacturing is a multitrillion-dollar challenge.

And in complex analytical processes, AI can enable more efficient and cost-effective decision-making in healthcare, he added.\n\u201cThe transformative potential of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform allows us to integrate advanced AI capabilities into our medical practices, enhancing patient care and streamlining clinical workflows like never before,\u201d he said.\nNHRI, the leading medical research institution in Taiwan, plays a crucial role in advancing public health through biomedical research and innovation. The integration of NVIDIA accelerated computing into its IT infrastructure marks a significant leap forward in the realm of AI-driven healthcare.\nNHRI\u2019s collaboration with NVIDIA also extends to the development of large language models tailored specifically for Taiwan\u2019s healthcare needs.\n\u201cTraditional Chinese medical records and genomic data present unique challenges that require localized solutions,\u201d said Dr. Feng-Chi Chen, deputy director of IPHS at the NHRI.\nThese challenges include the complexity of language variations and the need for precise genomic interpretations specific to Taiwan\u2019s population, Dr. Chen explained.\n\u201cNVIDIA accelerated computing enables us to create these solutions, ensuring that our healthcare system remains at the cutting edge of medical research,\u201d he said.\nCGMH, one of the largest healthcare systems in Taiwan, operates a network of 10 hospitals with a combined inpatient capacity of over 11,000 beds. It also serves millions of people in outpatient services. It\u2019s a cornerstone of Taiwan\u2019s healthcare system, which is one of the most advanced in the world.\n\u201cWith the computational power of Blackwell, we can expand our language model services to all hospitals under our umbrella, enhancing professional support, patient care and streamlining clinical workflows,\u201d said Dr. Chang-Fu Kuo, director of the AI center at CGMH. \u201cIt addresses the needs of various medical disciplines and diverse patient populations, enabling healthcare professionals to focus on critical clinical tasks and ultimately improve patient outcomes.\u201d\nNHRI, CGMH Pioneering Medical AI\nNHRI currently uses six NVIDIA DGX A100 systems for cloud and data center services, focusing on biomedical model training and genomic analysis.\nBy harnessing the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing, NHRI is also tackling pressing public health issues. One of its key projects involves using AI to predict the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions by analyzing a multitude of genetic and environmental parameters.\n\u201cThis level of analysis was previously unattainable due to computational constraints,\u201d said Dr. Chen. \u201cNow, with the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing, we will be able to offer more accurate risk assessments and preventative strategies.\u201d\nCGMH also has a diverse array of NVIDIA hardware, including NVIDIA H100, A100, and other Tensor Core GPUs, which it uses for medical imaging development and deployment. The foundation serves 46 models daily and intends to use Blackwell for LLM training and the deployment of service robots in hospitals.\nRunning these systems on premises and keeping the data within the hospital\u2019s infrastructure are key to ensuring patient data privacy as well as faster data processing and reduced latency, said Dr. Chihung Lin, deputy director of the CGMH AI center.\nThese technologies may be used in various medical applications, including:\n\nClinical Decision Support System: Developed on premises to ensure patient data confidentiality and privacy, this system assists clinicians by providing access to up-to-date data and guidelines and using models to answer questions and prepare medical decisions.\nPatient Interaction System: Allows patients to interact with a robot to get answers about their medication and medical conditions, reducing the burden on medical staff. Medical staff review the robot\u2019s responses to ensure accuracy.\nMedical Imaging: Enhances radiology and other imaging tasks using AI. This project is one of the most mature AI technologies in CGMH\u2019s healthcare system.\nPrecision Medicine: Handles large-scale genomic data and transforms sequences into readable medical reports for doctors. Focused on building computational facilities to support whole genome and exome sequencing.\nExpansion of AI Services: Aims to extend the language model services to all hospitals under CGMH\u2019s umbrella, leveraging the computational capacity from the Blackwell platform to support this expansion.\n\nOther applications include early detection of colorectal cancer via endoscopy, autoimmune disease screening through microscope images and kidney disease prediction using general imaging techniques.\nNHRI and CGMH\u2019s adoption of accelerated computing underscores the growing importance of AI and advanced computing in medical research and healthcare delivery.\nWith these tools, Taiwan is poised to make strides in improving patient outcomes and advancing biomedical science.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: COMPUTEX 2024 | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Through the bunq app, users can handle all their financial needs exclusively online, without needing to visit a physical bank.\nWith more than 12 million customers and 8 billion euros\u2019 worth of deposits made to date, bunq has become one of the largest neobanks in the European Union. Founded in 2012, it was the first bank to obtain a European banking license in over three decades.\nTo meet growing customer needs, bunq turned to generative AI to help detect fraud and money laundering. Its automated transaction-monitoring system, powered by NVIDIA accelerated computing, greatly improved its training speed.\n\u201cAI has enormous potential to help humanity in so many ways, and this is a great example of how human intelligence can be coupled with AI,\u201d said Ali el Hassouni, head of data and AI at bunq.\nFaster Fraud Detection\nFinancial fraud is more prevalent than ever, el Hassouni said in a recent talk at NVIDIA GTC.\nTraditional transaction-monitoring systems are rules based, meaning algorithms flag suspicious transactions according to a set of criteria that determine if an activity presents risk of fraud or money laundering. These criteria must be manually set, resulting in high false-positive rates and making such systems labor intensive and difficult to scale.\nInstead, using supervised and unsupervised learning, bunq\u2019s AI-powered transaction-monitoring system is completely automated and easily scalable.\nBunq achieved this using NVIDIA GPUs, which accelerated its data processing pipeline more than 5x.\nIn addition, compared with previous methods, bunq trained its fraud-detection model nearly 100x faster using the open-source NVIDIA RAPIDS suite of GPU-accelerated data science libraries.\nRAPIDS is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which accelerates data science pipelines and streamlines the development and deployment of production-grade generative AI applications.\n\u201cWe chose NVIDIA\u2019s advanced, GPU-optimized software, as it enables us to use larger datasets and speed the training of new models \u2014 sometimes by an order of magnitude \u2014 resulting in improved model accuracy and reduced false positives,\u201d said el Hassouni.\nAI Across the Bank\nBunq is seeking to tap AI\u2019s potential across its operations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly looking for new ways to apply AI for the benefit of our users,\u201d el Hassouni said. \u201cMore than half of our user tickets are handled automatically. We also use AI to spot fake IDs when onboarding new users, automate our marketing efforts and much more.\u201d\nFinn, a personal AI assistant available to bunq customers, is powered by the company\u2019s proprietary large language model and generative AI. It can answer user questions like, \u201cHow much did I spend on groceries last month?\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the Indian restaurant I ate at last week?\u201d\nThe company is exploring NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, a collection of generative AI microservices available in early access, to further improve Finn\u2019s accuracy. NeMo Retriever is a part of NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, which provide models as optimized containers, available with NVIDIA AI Enterprise.\n\u201cOur initial testing of NeMo Retriever embedding NIM has been extremely positive, and our collaboration with NVIDIA on LLMs is poised to help us to take Finn to the next level and enhance customer experience,\u201d el Hassouni said.\nPlus, for the digital bank\u2019s marketing efforts, AI helps analyze consumer engagement metrics to inform future campaigns.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a borderless banking experience for our users, always keeping them at the heart of everything we do,\u201d el Hassouni said.\nWatch bunq\u2019s NVIDIA GTC session on demand and subscribe to NVIDIA financial services news.\u00a0\nLearn more about AI and financial services at Money20/20 Europe, a fintech conference running June 4-6 in Amsterdam, where NVIDIA will host an AI Summit in collaboration with AWS, and where bunq will present on a panel about AI for fraud detection.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Banking | Customer Stories | Data Science | Financial Services | GPU | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Developers need solutions that can observe and measure activities, optimize operational efficiency, and prioritize human safety in complex, large-scale settings.\nResearchers are addressing that need with computer vision models that can perceive and understand the physical world. It can be used in applications like multi-camera tracking, in which a model tracks multiple entities within a given environment.\nTo ensure their accuracy, the models must be trained on large, ground-truth datasets for a variety of real-world scenarios. But collecting that data can be a challenging, time-consuming and costly process.\nAI researchers are turning to physically based simulations \u2014 such as digital twins of the physical world \u2014 to enhance AI simulation and training. These virtual environments can help generate synthetic data used to train AI models. Simulation also provides a way to run a multitude of \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios in a safe environment while addressing privacy and AI bias issues.\nCreating synthetic data is important for AI training because it offers a large, scalable, and expandable amount of data. Teams can generate a diverse set of training data by changing many parameters including lighting, object locations, textures and colors.\nBuilding Synthetic Datasets for the AI City Challenge\nThis year\u2019s AI City Challenge consists of five computer vision challenge tracks that span traffic management to worker safety.\nNVIDIA contributed datasets for the first track, Multi-Camera Person Tracking, which saw the highest participation, with over 400 teams. The challenge used a benchmark and the largest synthetic dataset of its kind \u2014 comprising 212 hours of 1080p videos at 30 frames per second spanning 90 scenes across six virtual environments, including a warehouse, retail store and hospital.\nCreated in Omniverse, these scenes simulated nearly 1,000 cameras and featured around 2,500 digital human characters. It also provided a way for the researchers to generate data of the right size and fidelity to achieve the desired outcomes.\nThe benchmarks were created using Omniverse Replicator in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a reference application that enables developers to design, simulate and train AI for robots, smart spaces or autonomous machines in physically based virtual environments built on NVIDIA Omniverse.\nOmniverse Replicator, an SDK for building synthetic data generation pipelines, automated many manual tasks involved in generating quality synthetic data, including domain randomization, camera placement and calibration, character movement, and semantic labeling of data and ground-truth for benchmarking.\nTen institutions and organizations are collaborating with NVIDIA for the AI City Challenge:\n\nAustralian National University, Australia\nEmirates Center for Mobility Research, UAE\nIndian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India\nIowa State University, U.S.\nJohns Hopkins University, U.S.\nNational Yung-Ming Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan\nSanta Clara University, U.S.\nThe United Arab Emirates University, UAE\nUniversity at Albany \u2013 SUNY, U.S.\nWoven by Toyota, Japan\n\nDriving the Future of Generative Physical AI\u00a0\nResearchers and companies around the world are developing infrastructure automation and robots powered by physical AI \u2014 which are models that can understand instructions and autonomously perform complex tasks in the real world.\nGenerative physical AI uses reinforcement learning in simulated environments, where it perceives the world using accurately simulated sensors, performs actions grounded by laws of physics, and receives feedback to reason about the next set of actions.\nDevelopers can tap into developer SDKs and APIs, such as the NVIDIA Metropolis developer stack \u2014 which includes a multi-camera tracking reference workflow \u2014 to add enhanced perception capabilities for factories, warehouses and retail operations. And with the latest release of NVIDIA Isaac Sim, developers can supercharge robotics workflows by simulating and training AI-based robots in physically based virtual spaces before real-world deployment.\nResearchers and developers are also combining high-fidelity, physics-based simulation with advanced AI to bridge the gap between simulated training and real-world application. This helps ensure that synthetic training environments closely mimic real-world conditions for more seamless robot deployment.\nNVIDIA is taking the accuracy and scale of simulations further with the recently announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX, a set of microservices that enable physically accurate sensor simulation to accelerate the development of fully autonomous machines.\nThis technology will allow autonomous systems, whether a factory, vehicle or robot, to gather essential data to effectively perceive, navigate and interact with the real world. Using these microservices, developers can run large-scale tests on sensor perception within realistic, virtual environments, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with real-world testing.\nOmniverse Cloud Sensor RTX microservices will be available later this year. Sign up for early access.\nShowcasing Advanced AI With Research\nParticipants submitted research papers for the AI City Challenge and a few achieved top rankings, including:\n\nOverlap Suppression Clustering for Offline Multi-Camera People Tracking: This paper introduces a tracking method that includes identifying individuals within a single camera\u2019s view, selecting clear images for easier recognition, grouping similar appearances, and helping to clarify identities in challenging situations.\nA Robust Online Multi-Camera People Tracking System With Geometric Consistency and State-aware Re-ID Correction: This research presents a new system that uses geometric and appearance data to improve tracking accuracy, and includes a mechanism that adjusts identification features to fix tracking errors.\nCluster Self-Refinement for Enhanced Online Multi-Camera People Tracking: This research paper addresses specific challenges faced in online tracking, such as the storage of poor-quality data and errors in identity assignment.\n\nAll accepted papers will be presented at the AI City Challenge 2024 Workshop, taking place on June 17.\nAt CVPR 2024, NVIDIA Research will present over 50 papers, introducing generative physical AI breakthroughs with potential applications in areas like autonomous vehicle development and robotics.\nPapers that used NVIDIA Omniverse to generate synthetic data or digital twins of environments for model simulation, testing and validation include:\n\nFoundationPose: Unified 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking of Novel Objects: FoundationPose is a versatile model for estimating and tracking the 3D position and orientation of objects.

I-HWA Cheng/AFP via Getty ImagesWhen artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia became the world's most valuable company last week -- surpassing household names like Apple and Microsoft -- the moment appeared to be a declaration of victory for the AI boom on Wall Street.Over the next three trading days, however, Nvidia shares plummeted 13%. The company lost more than $500 billion in value and plopped down to third place among the largest firms.Rather than a rebuke of AI or Nvidia, the extraordinary losses amounted to a routine selloff on a massive scale as traders sought to cash in on some of the gains made by the chipmaker during its meteoric rise, market analysts told ABC News.Analysts differed on whether the recent slide offers a worthwhile opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a favorable price.\"It's normal to see stocks take a breath,\" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at trading firm Interactive Broker, told ABC News. \"What's abnormal is that Nvidia went so far and so long without taking a breath.\"MORE: Apple launches AI-fueled tools for iPhone, Mac and iPadIt's difficult to overstate the success that Nvidia enjoyed prior to its recent decline. The California-based company, which sells the majority of computer chips behind new AI products like ChatGPT, saw its stock soar nearly 700% in two years.Even when accounting for the recent decline, shares of Nvidia have climbed nearly 150% since the outset of 2024.After a prolonged ascent, stocks often fall victim to a phenomenon called profit-taking, when traders sell off some of their shares to lock in the returns. In this case, analysts said, that routine pullback was larger than one might expect because the preceding rise had been unusually steep.\"It's not normal to have a stock go up this dramatically,\" Sosnick said. \"As a result, when it's due for a little bout of profit taking, that will be abnormal, too.\"Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, agreed. \"The stock has had a huge run,\" Feinseth told ABC News. \"Some people who are more short-term oriented feel it's time to take a profit.\"While citing a trend tied to market behavior rather than business performance, the analysts dismissed the notion of newfound weakness in the AI sector or Nvidia.The Nvidia headquarters is seen, Feb. 5, 2024, in Santa Clara, Calif.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesIn an earnings release last month, the company reported $26 billion in revenue, which marked a staggering increase of 262% over the previous year. Profits jumped more than 600% over that same period.In March, the company announced its latest and most powerful chip, Blackwell. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI are among a who's who of major tech firms set to adopt the new technology, Nvidia said in a statement.\"It's Nvidia's world -- everyone else is paying,\" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at investment firm Wedbush, told ABC News.Despite their agreement on the cause of the stock decline, analysts differed in their assessment of whether the current moment offers a chance for investors to jump into the stock.MORE: Corporations face challenge aligning policies with Pride marketing, some experts sayFeinseth encouraged investors to buy into the stock, since he expects the dip to draw renewed interest in the company and send the price higher. \"This is a stock that everybody wants to own and everybody is going to react to buying any selloff,\" he said.Early trading on Tuesday appeared to confirm that view. By noon, the stock had risen almost 5%, recovering much of what it had lost in recent days.\"This was just a small bump,\" Ives said.Sosnick, by contrast, cautioned against buying Nvidia shares unless the price falls further. Otherwise, he added, the relatively modest potential gains do not outweigh the risk of continued volatility.\"The stock is not super expensive but nor is it particularly cheap,\" Sosnick said.Related TopicsArtificial IntelligenceSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin updates: White House asks court to stay deportation flights TROMar 16, 5:36 PMTrump 2nd term live updates: Trump defends tariffs, declines comment on Ukraine aidMar 9, 8:31 PMTornado outbreak live updates: 40 dead in cross-country storm systemMar 16, 8:34 PMTrump admin updates: Trump attacks judge amid battle over deportation flights1 minute agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us \u00a9 2025 ABC News\n\n\n\n"

The spotlight has most recently been on generative AI, but AI-accelerated, NVIDIA RTX-powered tools have also been key in improving gaming, content creation and productivity over the years.\nThe NVIDIA Broadcast app is one example, using Tensor Cores on a local RTX GPU to seamlessly improve audio and video quality. Paired with the NVIDIA encoder (NVENC) built into GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs, the app makes it easy to get started as a livestreamer or to look professional during video conference calls.\nThe Stream Dream\n\nHigh-quality livestreaming traditionally required expensive hardware. Many livestreamers relied on software CPU encoding using the x264 software library, which often impacted gameplay quality. This led many to use a dual-PC setup,\u00a0with one PC focused on gaming and content and the other on encoding the stream. It was complicated to assemble, difficult to troubleshoot and often cost-prohibitive for budding livestreamers.\nNVENC is here to help. It\u2019s a dedicated hardware video encoder on NVIDIA GPUs that processes the encoding, freeing up the rest of the system to focus on game and content performance. Industry-leading streaming apps like Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) are adding support for NVENC, paving the way for a new generation of broadcasters on popular platforms like Twitch and YouTube.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA Maxine helps solve the issue of expensive equipment. It includes free, AI-powered features like virtual green screens and webcam-based augmented reality tracking that eliminate the need for special equipment like physical green screens or motion- capture suits. Broadcasters first got to experience the technology at TwitchCon 2019, where they tested OBS live on the show floor with an AI-accelerated green screen on a GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.\nMaxine\u2019s AI-powered effects debuted for RTX users in the RTX Voice beta, and moved into the NVIDIA Broadcast app.\nNow Showing: NVIDIA Broadcast\nNVIDIA Broadcast offers AI-powered features that improve audio and video quality for a variety of use cases. It\u2019s user-friendly, works in any app and is a breeze to set up.\nIt includes:\n\nNoise and Acoustic Echo Removal: AI eliminates unwanted background noise from both the mic and inbound audio at the touch of a button.\nVirtual Backgrounds: Features like Background Removal, Replacement and Blur help customize backgrounds without the need for expensive equipment or complex lighting setups.\nEye Contact: AI helps make it appear as though a streamer is looking directly at the camera, even when they\u2019re glancing off camera or taking notes.\nAuto Frame: Dynamically tracks movements in real time, automatically cropping and zooming moving objects regardless of their position.\nVignette: AI applies a darkening effect to the corners of camera images, providing visual contrast to draw attention to the center of the video and adding stylistic flair.\nVideo Noise Removal: Removes visual noise from low-light situations for a cleaner picture.\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast works by creating a virtual camera, microphone or speaker in Windows so that users can set up their devices once and use them in any broadcasting, video conferencing or voice chat apps, including Discord, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, OBS Studio, Slack, Webex and Zoom.\nThose with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX, TITAN RTX, NVIDIA RTX or Quadro RTX GPU can use their GPU\u2019s dedicated Tensor Cores to help the app\u2019s AI networks run in real time.\nThe same AI-powered technology in NVIDIA Broadcast is also available to app developers as a software development kit. Audiovisual technology company Elgato includes Maxine\u2019s AI audio noise removal technology in its Wave Link software, while VTube Studio \u2014 a popular app for connecting a 3D model to a webcam for streaming as an animated character \u2014 offers an RTX-accelerated model tracker plug-in as a free download. Independent developer Xaymar uses NVIDIA Maxine in his VoiceFX plug-in.\nContent creators can use this plug-in or Elgato\u2019s virtual studio technology (VST) filter to clean up noise and echo from recordings in post-processing in video editing suites like Adobe Premiere Pro or in digital audio workstations like Ableton Live and Adobe Audition.\n(Not) Hearing Is Believing\nSince its release, NVIDIA Broadcast has been used by millions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve utilized the video noise removal and background replacement the most,\u201d said Mr_Vudoo, a Twitch personality and broadcaster. \u201cThe eye contact feature was very interesting and quite honestly took me by surprise at how well it worked.\u201d\nUnmesh Dinda, host of the YouTube channel PiXimperfect, demonstrated NVIDIA Broadcast\u2019s noise-canceling and echo-removal AI features in an extreme scenario. He set an electric fan whirring directly into his microphone and donned a helmet that was intensely hammered on. Even with these loud sounds in the background, Dinda could be heard crystal clear with Broadcast\u2019s noise-removal feature turned on. The video has racked up more than 12 million views.\n\nNVIDIA Broadcast is also a useful tool for the growing remote workforce. In an article, Tom\u2019s Hardware editor-in-chief Avram Piltch detailed his testing of the app\u2019s noise reduction features against noisy air conditioners, lawn-mowing neighbors and even a robot-wielding, tantrum-throwing child. Broadcast\u2019s AI audio filters prevailed every time:\n\u201cI got my eight-year-old to fake throwing a fit right behind me and, once I enabled noise removal, every whine of \u2018I\u2019m not going to bed\u2019 went silent (at least on the recording),\u201d said Piltch. \u201cTo double the challenge, we had him throw a tantrum while carrying around a robot car with whirring treads. Once again, NVIDIA Broadcast removed all of the unwanted sound.\u201d\nEven everyday scenarios like video calls with a medical professional benefit from NVIDIA Broadcast\u2019s AI-powered background removal.\n\nToday I was video calling my doctor and she complimented me on how good the background blurring on my webcam looked.\nIt caught me so off guard, I didn't know how to respond, so I just gave her a step by step tutorial on how to use NVIDIA Broadcast \ud83d\ude29\n\u2014 Prismatic Ash (@_Ashdown) June 14, 2024\n\nDownload NVIDIA Broadcast for free on any RTX-powered desktop or laptop.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

The Associated Press piece discusses the rise of Nvidia, a company which started with the idea of improving graphics for video games. Founded in 1993, Nvidia has grown into a tech giant valued at over $3.2 trillion, especially influential in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia envisions its chips powering \u201cAI factories\u201d to revolutionize AI model training. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing unit (GPU), initially designed for gaming, is now essential for AI applications like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. This has positioned Nvidia as a leader in AI hardware, driving innovations across industries.\nThe CSET report, titled \u201cAI Chips: What They Are and Why They Matter,\u201c explains how AI chips work, why they have proliferated, and why they matter. It also shows why leading-edge chips are more cost-effective than older generations, and why chips specialized for AI are more cost-effective than general-purpose chips.\u00a0\nTo read the full article, visit the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nOriginal Publisher\nAssociated Press\nOriginally Published\nJune 20, 2024\n\n\nTopics\n\n              Supply Chains\n          \n\n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nAI Chips: What They Are and Why They Matter\nApril 2020\n\nThe success of modern AI techniques relies on computation on a scale unimaginable even a few years ago.

It overtook Apple earlier this month.The Californian company's meteoric rise has been fuelled by its dominance of what analysts call the \"new gold or oil in the tech sector\" - the chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).Speaking at an event in Copenhagen, Chris Penrose, global head of business development for telco at Nvidia, predicted further growth in the sector.\u201cThe generative AI journey is really transforming businesses and telcos around the world,\" he said.\u201cWe\u2019re just at the beginning.\u201dAnalysts Wedbush Securities agreed.\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" it said in a note earlier this week.Other commentators though have questioned whether there will be big future gains, given the increasing competition Nvidia faces.Rise and riseWhat is not in doubt though is how spectacularly it has grown.Eight years ago, the stock was worth less than 1% of its current price.Back then, Nvidia's value came from its competition with rival AMD, in a race to make the best graphics cards.In recent years though it has benefited from a boom in demand for chips that train and run generative AI models, the most well known of which being OpenAI's ChatGPT.The firm also benefitted significantly from a rush to mine cryptocurrency in 2020, which saw a sharp uptick in sales of its graphics cards.The rise and rise of the tech giant has been mirrored by the increasingly high profile of its boss, Jensen Huang.Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg even called the  61-year-old electrical engineer - known for his signature leather jacket - the \"Taylor Swift of tech\" for the celebrity status he has achieved.He's become well-known thanks in part to his popularity in his native Taiwan, where fans treat him as a rock star - posing for photos and even asking him to sign body parts.Why is Nvidia boss the 'Taylor Swift of tech'?Competition among AI developers is fierce. Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Meta and Apple are just some of the tech heavyweights battling to create a world-beating product.This competition benefits Nvidia, which as well as developing AI tech of its own, dominates the vast majority of the AI chip market.Nvidia\u2019s sales and profit figures have surpassed many analyst expectations in recent years.In May, after its latest set of financial results were published, Quilter Cheviot technology analyst Ben Barringer said the company had \"once again cleared a very high hurdle\".\"Demand is showing no signs of switching off either,\" he added.However, a minority are more cautious.In February, Barclays credit analyst Sandeep Gupta argued that Nvidia\u2019s large market share would be hard to maintain given the increasing number of rivals and questioned how Nvidia\u2019s customers would monetise AI software.Artificial intelligenceRelatedJazz great Herbie Hancock on playing with Miles Davis, AI, and why the piano makes him cry12 hrs agoCultureMarket alters application rules after AI complaints1 day agoEnglandAI offers 'generational opportunity' for schools2 days agoStoke & StaffordshireBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.
