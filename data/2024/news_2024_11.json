Jim Cramer sheds light on what\u2019s happening:   Here is why NVDA Stock is Declining Today According to Jim Cramer   That said, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the best technology so far, so much so that it \u201cwelcomes competition\u201d. The fact that Amazon makes some of its own chips, and remains Nvidia's \"happy\" customer, probably reinforces Nvidia's position as the go-to provider for premium, high-performance GPUs and AI chips, allowing the company to focus on its core strengths.  At the same time, many people don\u2019t know that Nvidia also has software, Cramer says. The AI darling chip maker just unveiled a groundbreaking generative AI model named Fugatto. Fugatto is designed as a versatile tool for creating and modifying sounds using text and audio prompts. Jim Cramer states that it is an AI idea factory project and that the CEO occasionally puts out ideas like these to \u201cget everyone thinking\u201d. Jensen's strategy with Fugatto seems designed to spark big-picture thinking about Nvidia's future, showcasing innovation reminiscent of what great companies used to do. While costly initiatives like this are rarer today, mega-cap companies like Nvidia continue to deliver value. This is why Jim Cramer says: \u201cDon\u2019t begrudge the mega caps\u2014just buy them\u201d  Our research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Treasury pick and highlighted his enthusiasm for the stock market. \u201cOn the other hand, President Trump was all about Nielsen ratings when he was on\u00a0The Apprentice,\u00a0and as president, he repeatedly said, The Dow Jones Industrial Average all-time high, and the S&P 500 were his new Nielsen ratings. He likes being rated, he likes to win, and he wants that stock market to go up to ratify his performance. That\u2019s a big reason why the market exploded higher when he won.\u201d  Cramer also discussed Trump\u2019s Treasury pick Scott Bessent\u2019s possible 3-3-3 plan that calls for bringing the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP, 3% growth and producing 3 million barrels of oil per day. Jim Cramer said he is skeptical about Elon Musk\u2019s efficiency plans in the upcoming Trump administration. \u201cCan there be a legitimate top-to-bottom change in the efficiency of our government and its associated costs? Count me as a skeptic about any attempt to change the government, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s Doge thing, because every penny of spending in the budget has a constituency. When you add all those proposed cutbacks together, you face tremendous opposition. But that\u2019s not the point. What matters is that this Treasury Secretary-designate is a serious person.\u201d  READ ALSO\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).   Jim Cramer Says Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Price Not Capturing \u2018Seismic Shift\u2019 Happening in Market   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 193 Talking about one of his favorite stocks, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in a latest program, Jim Cramer said:   Story Continues \u201cFrankly, I\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s happening at Nvidia. Never, just never. And even though the stock was down despite 19 firms raising their price targets this morning, I said this stock is simply not capturing the seismic shift that\u2019s happening here. You see, Nvidia is disrupting everything we know.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks to watch on latest news and analyst ratings. AI discussion boards online are buzzing with a new development where tech experts are pointing to a possible plateauing of performance in artificial intelligence applications. CNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa in a latest program quoted tech investor Ben Horowitz, who said in a recent podcast that he\u2019s not seeing performance improvement despite increasing GPUs. \u201cWe\u2019re increasing GPUs at the same rate, but we\u2019re not getting the intelligence improvements at all out of it.\u201d  OpenAI is reportedly facing similar problems with its upcoming AI model. \u201cThe Information reports that the quality increase in OpenAI\u2019s upcoming advanced model, Orion, is smaller than the jump seen between the last two flagship models, GPT-3 and GPT-4. In other words, generational advancements may have peaked as the models are essentially running out of data to train on,\u201d Bosa said.  While the next jump in AI performance is far away in the future, the possibilities this technology has unlocked based on the existing data and resources are keeping investors and Wall Street analysts busy.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).    A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Mizuho recently raised its price target for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $165 from $140 and reiterated its Outperform highlighting sustained momentum in the artificial intelligence accelerator market ahead of the company\u2019s quarterly results. Analyst Vijay Rakesh expects Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0to provide guidance for the January quarter in line with forecasts, positioning the company for a \u201cstrong\u201d 2025. He pointed to benefits from the GB200 ramp-up in NVL72 and GB300 later in the year. Rakesh also noted that Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s entry into the sovereign market could expand in 2025, potentially contributing around $10 billion, or roughly 9-11% of its data center revenue.   Story Continues Rakesh added that the AI server market now has a total addressable market of over $400 billion, with growth projected to exceed 60% from 2023 to 2027.Investors will be keenly watching Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) when the company reports its latest quarterly results this week.Nvidia\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s declines after the Q2 results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.At Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America\u2019s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cOver the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector,\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA\u2019s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA\u2019s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks to watch on latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

The advent of artificial intelligence has shaken up the Search business on the internet, a domain where Google has long reigned supreme. With AI models from startups like OpenAI, companies are offering natural language search capabilities to users that are cutting away Google's dominance in the Search market. Latest reports from news publication Bloomberg suggest that Google now faces added pressure with authorities in the US reportedly pushing the firm to spin off its Chrome browser business. The report further claims that authorities are also planning to recommend to a federal judge that Google face antitrust requirements related to AI and its Android mobile operating system.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The measures are a byproduct of a multilayer case that the Justice Department has built against Google. The government won the first round in the case earlier this year, which sought to prove that the tech giant has a web search monopoly in the US. In the ruling on this case, federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets. Per the Justice Department, the case against Chrome stems from the fact that the browser is a key access point through which many people use Google Search. Chrome controls about 61% of the browser market in the US, according to web traffic service StatCounter.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.  Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Global financial market experts are of the opinion that a plan by incoming US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on China imports is unlikely to harm NVIDIA. Tatiana Darie, a market expert, has opined for news publication Bloomberg that in addition to reducing exposure to China in recent years, the customer base of the chipmaker lies in the US, with hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta lining up to buy NVIDIA chips for their AI ventures.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that are worthy of investor attention. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Here is what happened: Analysts note that the stock has had some post-earnings reactions. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported impressive quarterly results with sales of $35 billion, a 94% year-over-year growth. Its data center business grew even faster, surging 112% due to robust AI demand. Net profit doubled to $20 billion, and the company also provided a robust outlook for the current quarter, slightly beating Wall Street expectations. Looking at the numbers, initial slips in the stock could have been some profit-taking. After all, the stock has roughly tripled this year.   Why NVDA Stock Lost 10% in One Week   Then again, the outlook was good, but not great. The company forecasted revenue of $37.5 billion for the fourth quarter, plus or minus 2 percent, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $37.09 billion according to data compiled by LSEG. While the rate of growth is still remarkable, it is clearly a slowdown from previous quarters. The fourth quarter forecast indicates year-to-year growth of about 70% from a year earlier, a stark decline from the 265% annual growth in the year-ago period.  Revenue, while rising 94% on an annual basis during the quarter that ended on Oct. 27, marks a consecutive slowdown from the previous three quarters where sales rose 122%, 262%, and 265% respectively. Adding to these post-earnings reactions is the market chatter revolving around a potential China trade war. On November 25, President-elect Donald Trump said he would be imposing big tariffs on goods coming from China, Canada, and Mexico on the first day he takes office. Trump, who will be taking office on January 20, separately outlined \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on imports from China, reports Reuters. Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, who covers Nvidia and the semiconductor industry, told clients in a note: \"Should they come to pass, the direct impact of these new tariffs on semiconductors would be very small as imports of 'raw semiconductors' into the U.S. from these affected countries are tiny\u201d. But he also said, \"escalation remains the larger potential worry as overall semiconductor imports (from all countries) might be large enough to be affected by more broad-based actions should the new administration feels so inclined.\"  When asked about the potential tariffs and their impact on Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company will comply with any regulation that comes along, fully. While the exact impact of the tariffs on Nvidia is unclear, new tariffs would indeed raise barriers to trade and most likely cause problems for Nvidia's supply chain.   Story Continues To add to these woes, Dell Technologies (DELL), a major Nvidia customer and partner, is facing a big drop in its stock price after its earnings report on Tuesday, November 26th. Despite server orders hitting a record high, Dell forecasts lower server sales for the fourth quarter since enterprise customers are waiting to get their hands on new systems powered by Nvidia Corp.\u2019s next-generation Blackwell graphics processing unit chips.As a result, they are shifting to later orders, implying some of them won\u2019t be reflected in the current quarter. Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell chips won\u2019t go on sale until early next year. Lastly, Nvidia's stock decline may be partly influenced by lower trading activity, as traders appear to be winding down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.Jim Cramer isn't concerned though. We summarized his NVDA thoughts yesterday here. According to Cramer, nothing is wrong. After all, we just saw the numbers, and they were great. The growing skepticism around the slowing rate of growth, increased competition, and the concern that investors are probably going to get less bang for their buck is misleading. There isn't competition from companies such as Amazon, which makes some of its chips to meet specific needs considering Nvidia doesn't have enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand and that's why the company's revenue will keep going up.Our research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

[+] Jiangsu Province, China, Nov 16, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images\nNvidia stock has been a standout performer in the AI boom, rising by over 180% year-to-date. However, could this remarkable run reverse, and the stock fall by over 50% from current levels? It\u2019s a real possibility. At the current market price of $140, Nvidia trades at over 80x trailing earnings and 50x projected FY\u201925 earnings. These multiples seem elevated, but they sure are supported by the company\u2019s recent high growth rates as Nvidia has been witnessing booming demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the go-to silicon for artificial intelligence applications.\n\n\nHowever, stock markets often extrapolate short-term trends into the long run. For another stock that has been volatile recently see Is Super Micro Stock A Buy Now? In Nvidia\u2019s case, the price likely assumes that demand growth, pricing power, and profits for Nvidia\u2019s accelerators will remain robust as the generative AI wave holds up. Yet, there are significant risks to this assumption, making a sizable correction a real possibility. The broader economic environment adds another layer of uncertainty. While markets have rallied following the election of Donald Trump, the risk of inflation persists amid threats of tariffs and deportation policies. These factors could impact the interest rate environment and, in turn, the valuation of high-growth stocks like Nvidia. (S&P To Crash More Than 40%?) We present this downside as a counter to our analysis of Nvidia\u2019s upside to $300. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock.\n\nHow Volatile Has Nvidia Stock Been?\n\nWhile NVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA\u2019s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular - as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year, compared to a 50% drawdown for Nvidia. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Growth Rates Could Cool Off\nNvidia\u2019s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. Nvidia\u2019s revenues were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, there is a possibility that growth could cool considerably or potentially even flatline.\nWhy?\nThe underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia\u2019s customers remain loss-making. Large language models are very expensive to build and train. VC firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, and the total could exceed $100 billion when including ancillary investments. Despite this, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few AI services besides ChatGPT gaining a large base of paying customers. We could very well be in a phase where companies are seeing so-called FOMO, compelling them to invest in AI just because their rivals are doing so, without a thought about the return on investments. As shareholders seek better returns, we could see capital spending cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. The macro environment might also play spoilsport. The Fed all but finalized last week that rates are unlikely to be cut in the Fed\u2019s December meeting amid concerns about inflation. Elevated interest rates could further compound the weak payback equation for AI GPUs.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your Taxes\n\nSeparately, large AI deployments have two stages: the compute-intensive training phase, which drives Nvidia\u2019s current demand, and the deployment phase, where trained models are used in real-world applications with lower power requirements. Most companies are going through the compute-intensive training phase at the moment, and there\u2019s a real possibility that demand for GPUs could cool off once these companies move to the deployment phase.\n\nEven if demand for Nvidia\u2019s products remains strong, growth could face challenges on account of supply constraints or execution issues. Nvidia has adopted a timeline of releasing a new AI chip series annually, which increases the risk of missteps. For instance, Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell chip faced certain design flaws which delayed its release by a quarter. Although these issues were eventually resolved, a recent report by The Information indicates that the chip is now overheating when used with certain customized server racks. While Nvidia is reportedly working with its suppliers to redesign these racks to address the problem, the incident highlights the risks associated with Nvidia\u2019s aggressive development schedule. Moreover, Nvidia relies almost entirely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for GPU production. This dependency could introduce further bottlenecks, as TSMC\u2019s production timelines may not align with Nvidia\u2019s ambitions. While Nvidia aims to launch a new AI chip every year, TSMC requires at least 18 months to set up new manufacturing facilities, according to The Economist. A potential misalignment between Nvidia\u2019s goals and TSMC\u2019s production capabilities could constrain Nvidia\u2019s ability to meet demand effectively.\n\n\nNow, Nvidia\u2019s revenues are on track to more than double this year to about $126 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 15% over the next two years due to the aforementioned factors, sales could see a much more subdued move from around $61 billion in FY\u201924 to about $166 billion in FY\u201927.\nNvidia\u2019s Margins Could Be At Risk \nNvidia\u2019s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been expanding - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY\u201919 to about 49% in FY\u201924 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for Nvidia\u2019s net income change.\nHowever, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why is that so? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia\u2019s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Customers are also looking for alternatives to Nvidia, as they look to better manage costs. On Monday IBM said that it was collaborating with AMD to include Instinct MI300X accelerators into its cloud offerings. Separately, big tech players like Google - who are among the biggest buyers of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs - are doubling down on their own AI and machine learning-related silicon. It\u2019s quite likely that stronger competition will make Nvidia\u2019s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable.\nHow Does This Impact Nvidia\u2019s Valuation? \nIf we combine 1.3x revenue growth (up 30%) between FY\u201925 and FY\u201927, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30%, or 0.7x), this would imply that net income could decline by roughly 10% by 2027. Now if earnings shrink by 10%, the P/E multiple is also likely to take a hit as investors re-assess Nvidia\u2019s long-term growth prospects. If Nvidia\u2019s P/E gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 50x now to about 25x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock by over 50% to levels of roughly $65 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? In practice, it won\u2019t make much difference whether it takes two years or five years - if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia\u2019s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a sizable correction in Nvidia stock. (Should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock?) And it could be a bumpy ride yet again.\nWhile there is certainly a case to be made for long-term gains from NVDA stock, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Trefis\nInvest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios\nSee all Trefis Price Estimates\nEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Omor Ibne Ehsan   November 16, 2024 8 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   AMD   -0.75%       NVDA   -2.43%             Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has tumbled 36% from its 52-week high of $211 in March and trades around $135 as of writing. The decline has been driven by disappointing earnings and guidance that fell short of Wall Street expectations. This dip has some investors wondering if now is the time to buy AMD on the cheap. However, a closer look at AMD's competitive position and growth prospects compared to rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suggests the choice may not be so clear-cut. Why Has AMD Stock Declined? Before we get into why AMD stock declined, let's first take a glance at its Q3 results.    However, the Q4 guidance disappointed analysts: Forecasted Q4 revenues between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, below the consensus estimate of $7.55 billion.   This guidance miss caused a 13% stock drop over two trading days.   These headwinds have soured market sentiment on AMD in the near term despite the company still growing revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q3. The question is whether the 36% pullback represents a buying opportunity for a quality company facing temporary issues or a sign of tougher times ahead. But first, let's look at what kind of competition AMD is facing. How Does AMD Stack Up Against Nvidia? Nvidia is AMD's biggest competitor\u2014we can all agree on that. That said, there are some differing opinions about how both companies could end up in the long run. Nvidia is focusing more on high-margin AI chips, whereas AMD is trying to undercut it and offer more value. I personally see it as something copied from AMD's playbook in the CPU market\u2014where AMD slowly and methodically caught up to Intel\u2014but it never managed to dominate it.  Nvidia currently has an edge over AMD in the high-end GPU market. It has AI features like DLSS but, AMD offers very competitive performance for the price with its RX 7000 series, especially in the mid-range. Nvidia holds a clear lead with its GeForce RTX series\u2014particularly the RTX 4090\u2014in terms of raw gaming power and ray tracing capabilities. AMD\u2019s Ryzen processors are highly competitive but do not challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the GPU space. But again, this doesn't really matter much. Analysts care much more about dedicated AI products than anything related to gaming. Nvidia also leads here with its H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which are widely adopted for large-scale AI training tasks. AMD\u2019s Instinct MI300X is competitive but still lags behind Nvidia in terms of market share. Current AI Product Stack (as of November 2024) Feature AMD Instinct MI300X Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU  Memory Capacity192GB HBM3141GB HBM3e Memory Bandwidth5.3TB/s4.8TB/s ArchitectureAMD CDNA 3Nvidia Hopper AI Performance (FP8)Up to 5,229 TFLOPS with sparsityUp to 3,958 TFLOPS with sparsity HPC Performance (FP64)Up to 81.72 TFLOPSUp to 34 TFLOPS Power Consumption (TDP)Up to 750WUp to 700W Target Use CaseGenerative AI, HPC, AI training/inferenceGenerative AI, HPC, AI training/inference  AMD Instinct MI300X: The price of the AMD MI300X AI accelerator ranges between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on the customer and volume of purchase. For instance, Microsoft reportedly pays around $10,000 per unit.   Story Continues Advantages: Higher memory capacity (192GB vs. Nvidia's 141GB). Solid for large-scale AI models like GPT-3 or PaLM. Greater memory bandwidth (5.3TB/s) allows faster data transfer for memory-intensive tasks. Superior peak theoretical performance in AI workloads, particularly in FP8 precision, making it highly efficient for large-scale generative AI tasks. Higher HPC performance in FP64 precision makes it more suitable for scientific simulations and other high-performance computing tasks. Disadvantages: Higher power consumption (750W vs. Nvidia\u2019s 700W). But again, this can be offset by the lower cost of the chip itself. AMD\u2019s ROCm software stack is still behind Nvidia\u2019s CUDA in terms of maturity and optimization for AI workloads. This makes it harder for developers to switch from Nvidia\u2019s established ecosystem. It also struggles with lower precision tasks like FP8. These are critical for AI training and inference. Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200 are better optimized here. Nvidia H200 Tensor Core GPU: The Nvidia H200 is priced significantly higher than the MI300X. It is estimated to cost around $30,000 to $40,000.Advantages: As I said, it has lower power consumption (700W). Strong inference performance, particularly in handling large language models like Llama2 with high throughput and efficiency. Better optimization for specific use cases like long input sequences and batch processing. Chatbots run a lot faster. Disadvantages: Lower memory capacity and bandwidth compared to the MI300X, which may limit its performance on extremely large models or memory-intensive tasks. Slightly lower peak theoretical performance in AI workloads compared to the MI300X.

However, Nvidia's established ecosystem will probably still give it an edge.It'll cost much more, though. Blackwell B100 could cost $30,000 to $35,000, whereas MI325X is estimated to be around $15,000-$20,000. Nvidia's GB200 Superchip could be even more expensive around $60,000 to $70,000.AMD is \"closing\" the gap with its upcoming releases\u2014especially in the data center segment\u2014but Nvidia remains dominant across both consumer and enterprise markets right now. I really don't see it changing anytime soon.Why?Nvidia\u2019s CUDA software ecosystem is a major reason customers stick with Nvidia GPUs. CUDA has become the industry standard for AI development. Switching from CUDA to AMD's ROCm involves significant effort and retraining of teams, and AMD will have to work overtime to convince customers to do that.Comparing the FinancialsNvidia is growing faster and is more profitable than AMD. Last quarter (Q2), Nvidia grew revenue by 122.4% to $30 billion with a 55.3% net margin. AMD currently has an 11.31% net margin in Q3, and the gap will likely widen once Nvidia reports Q3 figures next week. Here's what you should know for now:  Note: Q3 numbers for Nvidia are estimates, as per my research. Does AMD Offer More Value Than Nvidia?Valuation is more subjective these days as AI has thrown a curveball into how Wall Street slaps a premium on certain companies. AMD is\u2014and probably will be\u2014valued less than Nvidia, both in terms of market cap and how the broader market sees it. Thus, AMD stock trading at 28 times forward earnings against Nvidia's 38 times forward earnings doesn't necessarily make it cheaper.In fact, I would argue that AMD fares worse here. A lower P/E ratio does not necessarily mean better value. Nvidia\u2019s higher multiple is justified by its dominance in AI chips and its rapid revenue growth in this segment. Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market, which is expected to grow to $400 billion annually within five years. In contrast, AMD is still playing catch-up in AI\u2014as we looked at before.What do analysts say?  Nonetheless, I still don't think AMD is a \"better\" choice per se. Nvidia has been surprising analysts again and again in the past few quarters. Unless that changes in the coming quarter(s), I don't think AMD stock offers more value compared to NVDA stock.The Bottom LineIn terms of pure value\u2014considering upside potential relative to the current price\u2014AMD stock appears to offer more value than NVDA stock at this moment. NVDA stock remains an excellent long-term play for those focused on stability and leadership in AI, but\u2014if you take price targets seriously\u2014AMD stock provides a better risk-reward balance for investors willing to bet on its continued progress in catching up with Nvidia.In my opinion, you should hold both if you want exposure to AI, but NVDA stock should comprise more of that pie.While I acknowledge the potential of both AMD and NVDA as AI plays, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.\u00a0If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: Why is QUBT Stock up 400%?

After falling sharply with the rest of the market in early August, the stock is up over 50% from that low.It seems everyone wants to get their hands on NVDA stock, but that puts pressure on the company to continue to perform\u2014can it beat earnings estimates for a fifth time in a row next week?In case you missed it, the company did execute a 10-1 stock split, which is why the price of the stock seems much lower than earlier this year.On the Nov. 20 earnings call, Nvidia is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on $33.03 billion in revenue. Both figures are significantly higher than last quarter's estimates.As reported in the press release last quarter, Nvidia posted record quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and up 122% compared to last year. Quarterly Data Center revenue is also through the roof: $26.3 billion is 16% higher than the previous quarter and 154% higher than a year ago.Nvidia seems to be executing the same move for AI that Tesla did for EV\u2014make sure to dominate the parts that everyone needs to continue to boost their market share in the booming space. Tesla focused on making the best batteries and charging stations at the lowest price, and it made less sense for competitors to create their own. NVIDIA dominates the chips required to enhance AI software, and as long as the other Magnificent 7 stocks continue to battle for AI market share, Nvidia is in a great spot to benefit.Looking at the implied volatility of the options market can help us understand the potential magnitude of the move for next week. We can also compare that expected move to further-dated cycles to get a feel for how much weight the market is putting on this earnings announcement. Looking at next week, the market is pricing in a +/- $13.20 stock price move for NVDA. This is over 8% of the notional value of the stock price, so the market is expecting a big move next week considering most earnings announcements fall in the 5%-10% range.Looking through the end of the year, we see a +/- $23.53 expected move for the JAN \u201925 cycle. This tells us that even though implied volatility is high, the market is expecting even more volatility through the holidays and into next year. If this figure were smaller and closer to the expected move for next week, it would tell us the market is placing a ton of weight on the earnings report. We're not really seeing that.Bullish on NVDA stock for earningsIf you're bullish on NVDA stock for earnings, you're certainly looking for an EPS and revenue beat, even though estimates are higher. It almost feels like this is required for a bullish move, as NVDA has had such a strong year and there isn't much room for error with such massive increases year-over-year in performance. There are a lot of positive things happening for NVIDIA, but the AI and tech giant still needs to post stellar numbers if we're to expect a rally at all-time highs.Bearish on NVDA stock for earningsIf you're bearish on NVDA stock for earnings, you're looking for a tempering of success and a slower forecast relative to what we've seen this year. If NVDA misses on EPS or revenue, I think the market will have a hard time pushing this stock price higher. Competitors are still vying for market share, so the pressure is on for NVDA to perform.Tune in to Options Trading Concepts Live on Wednesday, Nov. 20 for an options trading strategy deep-dive session ahead of the earnings announcement for Nvidia!Mike Butler,\u00a0tastylive director of market intelligence, has been in the markets and trading for a decade.

president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\r\nNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\n\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.

All rights reserved\nNvidia\u2019s (NVDA) upcoming earnings report has the tech world buzzing. This article dives into the significance of the report, key drivers of Nvidia\u2019s growth, and what investors should watch for. This preview of Nvidia stock earnings explores key aspects investors should consider, from recent financial performance to AI's growing role in driving growth.\n\n\nWhy Nvidia\u2019s Earnings Report Matters \nNvidia\u2019s earnings report, which is scheduled to be released on November 20, carries immense weight for the company and the tech industry as a whole. The stakes are high for Nvidia stock earnings, as the company leads the AI revolution, making its results a key barometer for the tech industry.\n\nAs the backbone of AI hardware, Nvidia drives innovation across sectors like data centers, gaming and autonomous vehicles. A strong report not only bolsters investor confidence but also sets a benchmark for competitors like AMD and Intel, influencing the broader market outlook.\n\nThe AI boom has propelled Nvidia into the spotlight, with its GPUs powering generative AI models like ChatGPT. Analysts view the earnings report as a litmus test for the sustainability of Nvidia\u2019s dominance in this space. With increasing reliance on AI, the report\u2019s outcomes could ripple through related industries, affecting investment trends and corporate strategies.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Recent Financial Performance\nNvidia\u2019s recent financial results have been a showcase of its dominance in the AI and semiconductor industries. In the previous quarter, the company reported record revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122.4% year over year. The surge was largely driven by AI demand, with data center revenue contributing more than 70% of the total.\nThe recent growth trajectory of NVDA stock earnings demonstrates robust demand across AI and gaming sectors, boosting confidence in its market leadership. Gaming revenue also showed signs of recovery, rebounding 22% year over year, reflecting the easing of macroeconomic pressures. Nvidia\u2019s consistent profitability and strong gross margins\u2014above 70%\u2014further underscore its operational excellence.

With companies investing heavily in AI infrastructure, the continued demand for Nvidia\u2019s A100, H100 chips and Blackwell, will likely play a pivotal role in this quarter\u2019s performance.\nSupply Chain Challenges\nWhile demand remains robust, any disruption in chip production or supply chain logistics could constrain Nvidia\u2019s ability to meet orders. Recent geopolitical tensions add to these uncertainties.\nConsumer Spending Trends\nWith inflation moderating, consumer spending on gaming hardware is picking up, which could positively influence Nvidia\u2019s gaming division. However, a potential slowdown in enterprise IT spending could temper overall growth.\nRegulatory Changes\nThose impacting export licenses could significantly influence NVDA stock earnings, especially given its reliance on Chinese markets.\nThe Role Of AI And Data Centers In Nvidia\u2019s Growth \nAI has become the crown jewel of Nvidia\u2019s growth strategy. The company\u2019s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used in everything from chatbots to advanced analytics. Generative AI, in particular, has catapulted demand, with Nvidia benefiting from its early investments in AI-centric architectures.\nData centers represent another growth engine. Nvidia\u2019s dominance in this space, with products like the DGX SuperPOD, has solidified its position as the go-to provider for scalable AI infrastructure. Revenue from this segment has consistently surpassed expectations, demonstrating the increasing reliance of enterprises on Nvidia\u2019s technology.\nAI-driven advancements continue to propel Nvidia stock earnings, as the company solidifies its leadership in GPUs for large-scale computing and AI applications.\nThe Impact Of The Gaming Sector\nThe gaming sector, once Nvidia\u2019s bread and butter, continues to be a key contributor to its revenue. The company\u2019s RTX 40 series GPUs have been well-received, boosting revenue in recent quarters.\nPost-pandemic, the gaming industry experienced a slowdown, but recent data suggests a recovery. The resurgence of the gaming market has contributed positively to NVDA stock earnings, with the RTX 40 series outperforming competitor offerings.\nNvidia\u2019s efforts to optimize its products for gamers while capitalizing on AI-enhanced gaming experiences have positioned it favorably in this evolving market.\nNvidia Vs. Competition In The Market\nIn the race for AI dominance, Nvidia has maintained a significant lead over competitors like AMD and Intel. Its proprietary CUDA platform and robust ecosystem give it a clear edge in AI training and inference workloads.\nWhile AMD has made strides with its MI300 chips, they have yet to achieve the widespread adoption Nvidia enjoys. Similarly, Intel faces delays in delivering competitive GPU solutions. This disparity reinforces Nvidia\u2019s leadership in both innovation and market share.\nDiscover more in-depth insights, entrepreneurial advice and winning strategies that can propel your journey forward and save you from making costly mistakes.

Analysts forecast robust figures for Nvidia stock earnings and growth, which reflects surging demand for AI-driven technologies and expanding market penetration.\nHowever, the projections come with a caveat: Nvidia\u2019s high valuation means any miss could lead to significant market volatility.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette. \n\n\n\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year on year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with data center. Another record was achieved in data center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year on year. NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2x year on year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of DPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads.\n\n\n\n\n NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure, with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped year on year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year on year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models training, multimodal, and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5x in one year and cut time to first token by 5x. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance by an additional 2.4x. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full-stack, full-infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLink. And from liquid-cooled to air-cooled, every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us.\n\n\n\n\n Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in private preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200 and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper. The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4x reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput, and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI-native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Though Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners, Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Light Tricks, Harvey, Podium, Purser, and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of AI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIMs micro services is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Copilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture, with over 707,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA-powered agentic AI applications internally, including one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns for 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full-year revenue to increase over 2x from last year, and our pipeline continues to build. Overall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twin and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its Blackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to industries. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI.\n\n\n\n\n India's leading CSPs include product communications and data services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TFC, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and ARN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S. with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC, and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise, and major consulting companies, including EY Strategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries. Networking revenue increased 20% year on year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3x year on year. And our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their compute.\n\n\n\n\n Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus 100,000-Hopper supercomputer experienced zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% of data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now, moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year on year. Q3 was a great quarter for Gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue all growing sequentially and year on year. RTX end demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative, and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy, and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PC with up to 321 AI TOPS from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation, and coding. This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the AI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year on year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive.\n\n\n\n\n Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year on year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Global Cars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within data center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth-quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with seven different types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s. When fully ramp, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.\n\n\n\n\n GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3 in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen will deliver a keynote on January 6, and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day on January 7. Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please? Questions & Answers: Operator\n\n\n\n\n[Operator instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.C.J. Muse -- Analyst Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled.\n\n\n\n\n Obviously, we're very early here, but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So, is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Our foundation model pretraining scaling is intact, and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough, that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback, and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what is called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.\n\n\n\n\n And it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question. And so, we now have three ways of scaling, and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so, that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so, we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage.\n\n\n\n\n And so, we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Toshiya Hari -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B. On supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this, or is it specifically HBN? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Yeah. Thanks. So, let's see. Back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply. And that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so, Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up.\n\n\n\n\n You have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so, all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because, although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer, and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace. And the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company; Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron; Spill Amcor; KYEC; and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built; and Quanta and Wiwynn; and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo. And the number of companies is just really quite incredible. Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so, anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform. But it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's -- most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so, on the one hand, our annual road map reduces costs.\n\n\n\n\n But on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so, that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intention of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.Timothy Arcuri -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than -- I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So, I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So, I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So, you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n Colette, why don't you start?Colette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins, as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning, and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first program. So, you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round.\n\n\n\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so, that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so, machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so, on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something.\n\n\n\n\n Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so, these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so, we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\n\n\n\n\nVivek Arya -- Analyst Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main question, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just at the start of Blackwell? So, how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?Colette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President OK. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes.\n\n\n\n\n But yes, it is definitely possible.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if you just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's capex -- if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have plenty of old data centers. And so, what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. But let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's, in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so, we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey, digital marketing intelligence like Rider's, so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every platform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall. There were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies.\n\n\n\n\n Now, they're AI natives. And so, these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.Stacy Rasgon -- Analyst\n\n\n\n\n Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low 70s gross margins, does 73.5% count as low 70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up several billion dollars. But it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.Colette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President So, first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well.\n\n\n\n\n We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year, so we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell. So, we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes. Is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's possible, but we'll just have to see.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Joseph Moore -- Analyst Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling influence projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age, that you could use some of the Hopper chips for inference. So, I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there.\n\n\n\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so, we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7 and that there will be a whole bunch of AI native start-ups, thousands of AI native start-ups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I used the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so, I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI. Just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world.\n\n\n\n\n And it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so, that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is -- so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback. Instead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so, that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference, and we're starting to see that growth happening. So, I'm super excited about that. Now, let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build.\n\n\n\n\n And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so, the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger. They're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so, that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Aaron Rakers -- Analyst Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially. But then your comments were that you were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CFP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So, I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the Networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nColette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President Let's first start with the networking. The growth year over year is tremendous. And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So, this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems we are providing them to.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.Atif Malik -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. I have two quick ones for Colette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you mentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply constrained situation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply toward data center?Colette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\n\n\n\n So, first, starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and the work that they are doing. So, our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So, our Gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now, the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.Operator\n\n\n\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research. Your line is open.Ben Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So, very strong sequential growth this quarter, and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply just in the first half, there would be some catch-up. So, I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n and the China situation, have you gotten any sense or any conversations about tariffs or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there. Thanks so much.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer We guide one quarter at a time.Colette M. Kress -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\n\n\n\n\n We are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we need to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet working seamlessly with us to that. And once we get to next quarter, we'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next quarter going after that.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Whatever the new administration decides, we'll, of course, support the administration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that, do the best we can and just as we always do. And so, we have to simultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along fully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and to compete in the marketplace. We'll do all of these three things simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\nOperatorYour final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your line is open.Pierre Ferragu -- Analyst Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and inference as well and then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?\n\n\n\n\nJensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so, you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and reflection. And so, I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models, and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so, my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training, as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute. And we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution going.Operator\n\n\n\n\nThank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.Jensen Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n The computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us, and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us serve the entire multitrillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead from every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics. Thanks for joining us today, and catch up next time.\n\n\n\n\nOperator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:Stewart Stecker -- Senior Director, Investor Relations\n\n\n\n\nColette M.

It will be swapped out of the venerable blue-chip average for Sherwin-Williams (SHW). The NVDA and SHW changes will take place before the market opens on November 8.As much interest as such events generate, being tapped for the Dow is more symbolic than material. After all, the S&P 500 is the main benchmark for U.S. equity performance. That's why many trillions of dollars are invested in products that track the index.\n\n\nSubscribe to Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance\nBe a smarter, better informed investor.\n\n\nSave up to 74%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Kiplinger\u2019s Free E-Newsletters\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.\nProfit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.\n\n\n\n\nSign up\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the world, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), has more than $590 billion in assets under management alone. A comparable product for the DJIA, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), holds less than $39 billion in assets under management.Also know that, unlike the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, the Dow is weighted by price rather than by market cap. Although Nvidia has an outsized influence on the movements of the cap-weighted benchmarks, at current prices NVDA stock will be as important to the DJIA as, roughly, 3M (MMM).There's also the fact that it would have been nice if the keepers of the Dow had made this move sooner rather than later. Once Nvidia split its stock last spring, it became a good fit for the Dow.Intel, on the other hand, has been dead weight on the Dow for decades.Indeed, NVDA lapped INTC a long time ago as a credible representative of the semiconductor sector in a concentrated portfolio. (Recall that the Dow comprises just 30 stocks.)True, NVDA's share price pre-split made it essentially ineligible for Dow membership, but it's impossible not to look back at the charts and wonder what could have been. The bottom line is that the Dow would be higher today had NVDA been a component rather than INTC.Nvidia for the long runAs we have noted, anyone who put $1,000 into Intel stock 20 years ago has endured a destruction of their capital. Nvidia, on the other hand, has been among the greatest wealth creators of the past several decades. Have a look at what $1,000 invested in Nvidia stock 20 years ago would be worth today. If you wish you had a time machine, you are not alone.Suffice to say the DJIA's performance would have been better with Nvidia in it. But that wasn't possible. So, is this better late than never?That's harder to say. Ordinarily, one wants to buy low. Nvidia is up 178% so far this year on a price basis. Heck, shares have gained nearly 30% over the past three months. There's another Wall Street cliche about the easy money already having been made. And it is always true that past performance is not a guarantee of future results.Either way, the DJIA is certainly more representative of whatever it's supposed to represent with NVDA in it rather than INTC. But apart from having the imprimatur of the editors of the Dow, nothing fundamental has changed.This fact by itself should be of enormous comfort to Nvidia bulls, of which there are legions on the Street. Of the 62 analysts issuing opinions on NVDA stock surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 48 rate it at Strong Buy, 10 say Buy and four call it a Hold. That works out to a rare consensus recommendation of Strong Buy. Indeed, Nvidia routinely makes the list of analysts' top S&P 500 stocks to buy.As to whether you should add to your exposure to Nvidia stock based on its inclusion in the Dow, the answer is no. If you own diversified funds or ETFs tracking, for example, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite or Nasdaq-100, you already own Nvidia \u2013 and it's probably enough.As exciting and enviable as Nvidia's position in artificial intelligence (AI) may be, it is ultimately a chip maker. The chip industry is cyclical, and no stock has ever gone up in a straight line.Related ContentIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Amazon Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Apple Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Microsoft Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have Today\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Kiplinger Today newsletter \u2014 freeProfit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.

(NVDA) reported strong Q3 free cash flow margins and analysts have raised their revenue forecasts. This means NVDA stock could be undervalued by 26% with a price target of $179 per share. Shorting OTM puts is attracting interest.NVDA is at $142.19 in midday trading on Friday, Nov. 22. This is down from its recent peak of $148.88 on Nov. 7. It's been treading water, but could be due for a rebound, based on its strong results. For example, value investors see Nvidia's strong FCF margins and believe it could be worth substantially more. Let's look at why.Strong FCF ResultsOn Nov. 20, Nvidia reported that for the quarter ending Oct. 27,\u00a02024, its free cash flow (FCF) hit $16.8 billion and revenue was $35.1 billion. Both of these figures are peak results. More importantly, its FCF margins also rose (see the table below). This shows that almost half (47.85%) of its revenue is converted into cash flow that is \u201cfree\u201d of any cash obligations. It goes straight into the company's checking account. FCF is leftover cash flow after all cash spending. That includes cash expenses on the income statement, as well as capital expenditures and net working capital flows, both on the cash flow statement.The bottom line is that the company is a cash-generating cash cow. Moreover, the portion of revenue becoming FCF is increasing. This implies that its operating leverage is increasing.\u00a0That is why NVDA stock is worth much more. Let's look at why.Projecting FCF for 2025Analysts have raised their 2025 revenue forecasts since the Q3 earnings release. For example, in my prior Barchart article, I wrote on Nov. 5 that analysts had an average revenue forecast of $177.89 billion. Now they are projecting $192.48 billion for 2024, up +8.2%.As a result, we can project a much higher free cash flow for 2025. For example, to be conservative, let's use a lower 46% FCF margin. This results in an $88.5 billion FCF forecast: $192.48 billion (2025 sales forecast average) x 0.46 (FCF margin) = $88.54 billion FCFThis FCF is $30 billion higher than the $56.5 billion in FCF made in the last 12 months (LTM) S. It implies that free cash flow could rise over 56% in the coming year. That could push NVDA stock much higher. Let's estimate that.Setting a Price TargetOne way to set a valuation target price is to assume that 100% of its free cash flow will be paid out to shareholders. What will the market do? What yield will the stock have?NVDA could end up with a 2.0% dividend yield based on its historical FCF yield figures and comp metrics. Here is how to reverse engineer its market cap: $88.54 billion FCF in 2025 / 0.02 = $4,427 billion market cap (i.e., $4.4 trillion)This is 26% higher than its market cap today of $3.505 trillion.In other words, NVDA stock is worth 26% more or $179 per share (i.e., $142.19 x 1.26 = $179.16).Analysts Agree\u00a0Analysts have raised their price targets as well. For example, Yahoo! Finance's survey of 64 analysts has an average price target of $170.44, or 20% higher.Moreover, AnaChart.com, which tracks analysts' price targets as if they are stocks, shows that the average of 39 analysts is $176.47, or +24% higher. That is very close to my $179 price target.In addition, the table below shows that many analysts have now raised their price targets. Note that many of these analysts have good track records. Most of these analysts have \u201cPrice Targets Met Ratio\u201d metrics greater than 90%. That means their price targets have worked out 90% of the time.One way investors find it interesting to play this is to set a lower buy-in target by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) puts. That way they can accumulate income while waiting for NVDA to fall to a lower price at which the short seller would be obligated to buy the shares.Shorting OTM PutsI discussed this in my Nov. 5 Barchart article, \u201cNvidia Put Options Premiums are Sky-High - Good for Short Sellers Ahead of Earnings.\u201d I suggested that the $130 strike price puts expiring today on Nov. 22 were cheap at $4.00.Today those puts are almost worthless. That means the 3.077% in income that the investor made immediately has worked out well (i.e., $4.00 / $130.00 = 3.077%), with less than 3 weeks until expiration. The investor will not be obligated to buy shares at $130. (Note at the time the delta ratio was -29% - i.e., there was less than a 30% chance that the investor would be forced to buy at that strike price).Today, put options expiring Dec. 13 (i.e., three weeks away) with a similar delta ratio, are trading for $3.05 per put contract. That is the bid side premium for the $137.00 strike price expiring Dec. 13 with a -31% delta ratio.This gives short-put investors an immediate yield of 2.22% (i.e., $3.05/$137.00). Note that the strike price is about 4.6% out-of-the-money - i.e., below today's trading price. So, this provides some downside protection.For example, even if NVDA falls to $137.00 in the next 3 weeks, and the investor is obligated to use the cash secured to buy shares at $137.00, the breakeven price would still be lower by $3.05 (i.e., $137.00 - $3.05 = $133.95).\u00a0In other words, the investor has a 5.79% downside protection. Moreover, the investor can defray any potential unrealized loss if this occurs by shorting OTM puts in the future.\u00a0The bottom line is that this is a good way to set a lower buy-in target price. NVDA stock looks undervalued over the next year due to its huge FCF and FCF margins. This OTM short-put play is attractive to value investors. On the date of publication, Mark R.

The company's shares    saw a significant share price rise of 51% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS.   The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price.     As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock.  But what if there is still an opportunity to buy?  Today we will analyse the most recent data on NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.     Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What Is NVIDIA Worth?  NVIDIA appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average.  We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 68.9x is currently well-above the industry average of 30.56x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers.   But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future?  Given that NVIDIA\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.      What does the future of NVIDIA look like? NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth November 8th 2024 Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.   Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations.    With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.    What This Means For You Are you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price,  with shares trading above industry price multiples.  At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell?  If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time,  now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the  optimistic prospect  is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.   Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

            "response": "Applied Digital has emerged as a company to watch as Nvidia  discloses  stake in the company | tastylive\n\nOPEN A tastytrade ACCOUNTFAQGlossaryHelp CenterSign UpLog Intastylive BlogApplied Digital (APLD) Valuation in Focus After Nvidia (NVDA) Reveals New StakeImage generated with Dall-e 3Nov 20, 2024Applied Digital (APLD) Valuation in Focus After Nvidia (NVDA) Reveals New StakeBy:Andrew ProchnowThis small-cap stock is clinging to Nvidia\u2019s coattails, all the way to a 90% rallyApplied Digital\u2019s shares have climbed more than 90% in the past six months, fueled by a pivot toward high-performance computing and a new investment by Nvidia.\u00a0The company has expanded from blockchain to AI infrastructure, delivering impressive revenue growth in recent quarters as it scales its operations to meet surging demand for high-performance computing.Small-cap companies like Applied Digital aren\u2019t easy to value, but the combination of the latest strategic pivot, increasing revenue and Nvidia\u2019s backing suggests the stock has more room to run.\u00a0As artificial intelligence and high-performance computing continue to evolve, Applied Digital (APLD) has emerged as a company to watch. The stock has surged an impressive 90% over the past six months, fueled by strong revenue growth and a strategic pivot toward AI infrastructure. Adding to the buzz, Nvidia (NVDA), the undisputed leader in AI hardware, recently disclosed a 3% stake in Applied Digital, representing 7.72 million shares valued at $63.66 million as of the end of Q3 on Sept. 30.What does Nvidia\u2019s involvement mean for Applied Digital\u2019s valuation and long-term prospects? The investment not only strengthens the company\u2019s financial position but also highlights its potential to become a key player in the AI-driven economy. With momentum on its side and a growing footprint in cloud services and high-performance computing (HPC), Applied Digital is navigating a critical phase in its growth. Let\u2019s explore the company\u2019s recent developments, assess its valuation and consider what might constitute a fair price for its shares.Building infrastructure for cutting-edge technologyIn the rapidly evolving world of technology, Applied Digital has emerged as a key player in HPC. Specializing in next-generation data centers, the company is positioned to support the growing demands of AI and blockchain technology\u2014two forces reshaping tech.Applied Digital\u2019s business model revolves around designing and operating cutting-edge data centers capable of managing the vast computational and energy requirements of AI workloads and blockchain networks. Strategically located in areas with access to low-cost renewable energy, these facilities underscore the company\u2019s commitment to sustainability\u2014an increasingly critical factor in an industry grappling with its environmental impact.The company\u2019s rise coincides with a broader shift toward decentralized systems and generative AI\u2014both requiring immense computing resources. From training large language models to powering decentralized finance and Web3 applications, the demand for scalable, energy-efficient infrastructure has never been greater. Applied Digital\u2019s ability to deliver, build and operate data centers places it in a strong competitive position as businesses and developers seek reliable partners to meet their growing needs.Applied Digital Investor PresentationCompeting on sustainability and cost efficiencyIn the competitive world of high-performance computing, Applied Digital is carving a niche by targeting cost-conscious and sustainability-focused clients. The company finds itself compared to players like CoreWeave, a rapidly growing provider of AI server rentals with high-profile contracts, including its partnership with Microsoft. While CoreWeave leverages scale and strategic relationships to dominate certain segments of the AI infrastructure market, Applied Digital offers a distinct value proposition: cost-effective, energy-efficient data centers tailored to the surging demand for AI-driven workloads.Applied Digital\u2019s recent pivot from its blockchain-focused origins to a broader emphasis on AI infrastructure marks a significant step in its evolution. This diversification aligns with industry trends, as AI applications continue to outpace other technologies as growth drivers for businesses across sectors.Despite its promising focus, Applied Digital operates in a highly competitive field. Established giants like Nvidia, AWS and Google Cloud dominate the HPC market, while smaller, specialized providers, including CoreWeave, vie for market share. The company\u2019s success hinges on its ability to stand out through innovation and sustainability\u2014qualities that resonate with clients balancing performance needs with financial and environmental concerns.By positioning itself as a critical enabler of emerging technologies, Applied Digital is playing a pivotal role in bridging the gap between innovation and infrastructure. As AI and decentralized systems continue to shape the future, companies like Applied Digital may become indispensable in building the foundation for tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs.Surging revenue, rising profit potentialApplied Digital\u2019s financial performance showcases a company in transition, navigating the challenges of scaling while delivering substantial revenue growth. In Q4 2024, revenue surged 98% year-over-year (YoY) to $43.7 million, up from $22 million in the same period of the previous year. This remarkable growth was fueled by the expansion of its data center hosting operations and the early deployment of its cloud-services business. The momentum carried into Q1 2025, with revenue climbing 67% YoY to $60.7 million, driven by the addition of cloud clusters and increased use of HPC facilities (highlighted below).Sequentially, revenue grew 38.9%, rising from $43.7 million in Q4 2024 to $60.7 million in Q1 2025. This robust quarter-over-quarter growth underscores Applied Digital\u2019s ability to diversify its revenue streams and optimize its infrastructure. However, the company\u2019s path to profitability remains a challenge, with significant investments in expansion weighing on the bottom line. The net loss widened substantially in Q4 2024 to $64.8 million, up from just $6.5 million in the same quarter the previous year, reflecting increased depreciation expenses and operational setbacks like power outages.In Q1 2025, there was a notable improvement as the net loss narrowed to $4.2 million, thanks to operational efficiencies and stabilized revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)\u2014a key indicator of operational cash flow\u2014improved from $4.8 million in Q4 2024 to $20 million in Q1 2025, signaling progress in managing costs while driving revenue. However, adjusted net loss for the quarter remained significant at $21.6 million, partly because of $4.4 million in expenses tied to facilities not yet generating revenue.Applied Digital\u2019s liquidity has also strengthened. Cash holdings rose to $86.6 million in Q1 2025, up from $31.7 million at the end of Q4 2024, boosted by a $160 million private placement financing led by Nvidia. This funding supports ongoing development of the Ellendale HPC campus, which will eventually provide 400 MW of total capacity with plans for further expansion. Debt levels increased modestly to $143.6 million, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of the company\u2019s growth initiatives.With its ability to sustain strong revenue growth while narrowing losses, Applied Digital is establishing itself as a promising player in HPC and cloud services. However, the company\u2019s long-term success hinges on its capacity to deploy infrastructure effectively and turn its investments into sustainable revenue streams. For investors, the latest earnings results signal progress, but they also highlight the high stakes and inherent risks of Applied Digital\u2019s ambitious growth strategy.Assessing Applied Digital\u2019s valuationValuing Applied Digital presents challenges because the company remains in a high-growth phase, marked by expanding revenue but ongoing net losses. Traditional valuation metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, are rendered moot given the company\u2019s history of reporting losses. However, several factors suggest Applied Digital's valuation merits closer consideration, particularly as it narrows its losses and demonstrates strong revenue growth.One key factor boosting the company\u2019s prospects is the recent $160 million private placement financing, which included an investment from Nvidia, a titan in AI and HPC. Nvidia\u2019s involvement signals more than just financial backing\u2014it implies a level of strategic support that could enhance Applied Digital\u2019s credibility and positioning in the market. Whether through direct partnerships, technical collaboration or broader ecosystem integration, Nvidia\u2019s backing makes Applied Digital a trusted player in fast-growing HPC and cloud services.Wall Street analysts appear to share this optimism. Of the seven analysts covering Applied Digital, all rate the stock a \u201cbuy,\u201d with an average price target of $10.70, reflecting attractive upside from the current price of around $9/share. This bullish consensus is underpinned by Applied Digital\u2019s strong revenue trajectory, with quarterly revenue increasing nearly 100% year-over-year in Q4 2024 and continuing to climb in Q1 2025. Moreover, the company\u2019s financials are trending in the right direction: Applied Digital recently reported a loss of $0.15 per share, which was narrower than the $0.27 consensus loss forecasted by analysts. This beat on earnings highlights the company\u2019s improving operational efficiency and ability to manage costs, even as it invests heavily in its expansion.At a market cap of approximately $2 billion, Applied Digital remains a small-cap stock, which inherently comes with an added layer of volatility. This relative uncertainty is amplified by the company\u2019s ambitious growth plans and the nascent stage of its profitability journey. However, its low market cap also suggests significant upside potential, particularly if the company can continue its revenue growth trajectory and demonstrate progress toward sustained profitability. Rising revenue\u2014fueled by cloud services and HPC infrastructure\u2014 support the notion that the company is moving in the right direction.Compelling value proposition, but risks remainValuing a company like Applied Digital is anything but straightforward, especially following its remarkable 90% rally over the last six months. The momentum driving both the stock and the broader AI sector has been a key factor in its rise, demonstrating the market\u2019s enthusiasm for all things AI. With Nvidia\u2019s recent investment in Applied Digital, the company\u2019s story has become even more compelling, adding a layer of credibility and fueling expectations for future growth.Applied Digital\u2019s enterprise value/sales (EV/Sales) ratio of approximately 11 suggests the company\u2019s current valuation is not excessively inflated, especially in the context of its high-growth focus on AI and cloud computing. While this figure is higher than the sector median, it remains far more reasonable than Nvidia\u2019s elevated EV/Sales ratio of 35. In comparison, companies like Dell (DELL) (EV/Sales: 1) and Microsoft (MSFT) (EV/Sales: 12) reflect the diversity of valuations within the tech sector, with Dell\u2019s lower multiple tied to its focus on traditional hardware, which doesn\u2019t command the same premium as the cutting-edge niches of AI.\u00a0This places Applied Digital in a middle ground\u2014valued as a growth company with strong potential, but not priced at the extremes often seen with AI. This measured valuation, combined with the company\u2019s growing revenue, suggests its stock may be appropriately priced, with further upside as it continues to scale its operations. Reflecting that optimism, all seven analysts who cover Applied Digital currently rate the stock a \u201cbuy,\u201d with an average price target of around $10.75/share.\u00a0However, investors should remain cautious. Smaller-cap stocks like Applied Digital, especially those with valuations based on future growth assumptions, are highly sensitive to broader market conditions. If the market encounters turbulence, Applied Digital could see a sharp pullback, as high-momentum sectors like AI often experience disproportionate sell-offs during periods of uncertainty. In a scenario like that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see shares dip temporarily into the $4-$6 range.For now, a price target of $10-$12 per share appears reasonable, balancing the company\u2019s upside potential against its inherent risk. Applied Digital is undoubtedly positioned to capitalize on the AI boom, but its journey will likely remain volatile\u2014a hallmark of small-cap stocks operating in fast-evolving, momentum-driven sectors. Investors and traders would therefore do well to approach with a blend of optimism and caution, recognizing both the transformative potential of AI, as well as the cyclical nature of market sentiment.Andrew Prochnow\u00a0has more than 15 years of experience trading the global financial markets, including 10 years as a professional options trader.

For the time being, please use the NVIDIA Control Panel to configure them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo features powerful new AI-powered tools to enhance streamed and locally-played videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the power of AI, RTX Video HDR instantly converts any Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video into a vibrant High Dynamic Range (HDR) video when played in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or the VLC media player RTX branch. Use the full capabilities of your display\u2019s HDR capabilities to display more vivid, dynamic colors to further enhance your experience on GeForce RTX PCs and laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRTX Video Super Resolution (VSR) uses AI to enhance streaming video on all GeForce RTX GPUs by removing compression artifacts, and sharpening edges when upscaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the System > Video tab in the NVIDIA app, you can easily activate these options, and see in real-time if they\u2019re active when watching video or streams.

Given the extensive global presence of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.  The global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects. International market involvement serves as insurance against economic downturns at home and enables engagement with economies that are growing more quickly. Still, this move toward diversification is not without its challenges, as it involves navigating through the fluctuations of currencies, geopolitical threats, and the distinctive nature of various markets. Upon examining NVDA's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts. For the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $35.08 billion, experiencing an increase of 93.6% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of NVDA's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations. Trends in NVDA's Revenue from International Markets China (including Hong Kong) accounted for 15.44% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $5.42 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +48.4%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $3.65 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, China (including Hong Kong) contributed $3.67 billion (12.21%) and $4.03 billion (22.24%) to the total revenue, respectively. Taiwan generated $5.15 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 14.69% of the total. This represented a surprise of -20.79% compared to the $6.51 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Taiwan accounted for $5.74 billion (19.11%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $4.33 billion (23.91%) to the total revenue.   Story Continues Prospective Revenues in International MarketsIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that Nvidia will post revenues of $37.74 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 70.8% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan to this revenue are 10.9% and 16.6%, translating into $4.11 billion and $6.26 billion, respectively.For the entire year, the company's total revenue is forecasted to be $127.67 billion, which is an improvement of 109.6% from the previous year. The revenue contributions from different regions are expected as follows: China (including Hong Kong) will contribute 10.9% ($13.91 billion) and Taiwan 17.9% ($22.88 billion) to the total revenue.Closing RemarksRelying on global markets for revenues presents both prospects and challenges for Nvidia. Therefore, scrutinizing its international revenue trends is key to effectively forecasting the company's future outlook.In a world where international interdependencies and geopolitical conflicts are ever-increasing, Wall Street analysts closely monitor these trends for companies having international presence to adjust their earnings forecasts. Of course, there are several other factors, including a company's standing within its home borders, that influence analysts' earnings forecasts.At Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool - the Zacks Rank - harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions and serves as an effective indicator of a stock's near-term price performance.Nvidia, bearing a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is expected to outperform the broader market's movements in the near term.

Although these targets are of limited utility, they do form the basis for declaring whether a stock is a Buy, Hold or Sell.As of now, NVDA's average price target stands at about $170, up roughly 6% from the pre-earnings release target of about $160, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.NVDA's new average price target gives shares implied upside of about 20% over the next 12 months. The old price target \u2013 based off NVDA's previous level \u2013 gave the stock implied upside of about 13%.It's hard to believe Nvidia has become a $3 trillion company because of its potential for 13% or 20% price upside over the next year or so. Heck, the stock nearly tripled over the past 52 weeks.Price targets. Go figure.Perhaps relative valuation can be more helpful.Nvidia is cheap, relatively speakingFirst, a caveat about valuation. While absolutely critical, valuation tends to play out on its own time frame. This time frame can be much longer than investors expect. Keep this in mind when looking at Nvidia, as the stock usually looks expensive and yet it keeps going up.That said, NVDA's relative valuation does look increasingly compelling by some measures these days.For one thing, while it's true that Nvidia changes hands at nearly 35 times analysts' average next-12-months earnings per share (EPS) estimate, this multiple represents a 20% discount to its own five-year average, according to data from LSEG Stock Reports Plus.Perhaps more importantly, after updating their models, analysts' average long-term growth forecast now stands at more than 62%, per LSEG.These revisions make NVDA look attractively priced once you consider how fast the stock is rising relative to its growth prospects. Indeed, by at least one metric \u2013 the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio \u2013 Nvidia stock looks very cheap on a relative valuation basis.Here's why: since NVDA stock is trading at 35 times expected earnings and has a LTG forecast of more than 62, its forward PEG is 0.6. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 trades at a PEG of 2.1.By this measure, NVDA trades at a 70% discount to the broader market. That's not bad, but then Nvidia and the broader market are sort of apples and oranges.That's why we want to look at Nvidia's PEG relative to its peers and itself. This gives us an idea of what sort of premium the market has been willing to pay for Nvidia's growth prospects in the past.And what do we find? Bulls will be happy to know that with a PEG ratio of 0.6, Nvidia stock trades at a 70% discount to the semiconductor industry average.Even more intriguing, however, is that NVDA stock also trades at a steep discount to its own five-year average. Indeed, per LSEG Stock Reports Plus, if Nvidia's PEG \"returned to historical form,\" the stock would trade at $349.04.That's not a price target, mind you, it's just some modeling. But it does give NVDA stock implied price upside of about 150% from current levels.As for Wall Street's collective wisdom on this top-rated Dow Jones stock, of the 63 analysts issuing opinions on NVDA surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 47 call it a Strong Buy, 12 have it a Buy and four say it's a Hold.That works out to a consensus recommendation of Strong Buy, making Nvidia one of the Street's top S&P 500 stocks to buy too.Related ContentIf You'd Put $1,000 Into Nvidia Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayNvidia Stock Is Joining the Dow.

The European Union recently released the initial draft for the general-purpose AI code of practice under the AI Act, its comprehensive framework aimed at regulating artificial intelligence. This section of the AI Act, which became law earlier this year, specifically addresses general-purpose AI model providers, setting out standards and practices they must follow to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. Some of the AI models that will be impacted by regulations drafted as discussions on this draft progress include GPT models by OpenAI and Claude by Anthropic, among others.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, London-based AI startup Tessl recently raised more than $125 million in a funding round led by prominent venture capital firms like Index Ventures, Accel, GV, and Boldstart. According to a report by TechCrunch, this has pushed the valuation of the startup to more than $500 million. The startup is building an AI native platform that developers and their teams can use to create and maintain software. The firm is still developing the product and plans to launch it in the open market by sometime next year. The basic idea behind the business is to help write code to match specifications set by developers and their teams, in natural language or code.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).    A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 14, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri raised the price target on the stock to $170 from $140 and kept a Strong Buy rating on the shares. Raymond James sees another strong quarter driven by healthy Hopper demand and early Blackwell ramps, but supply remains a wildcard and consensus has already moved higher, which could limit near-term upside, the advisory told investors in a research note. The advisory thinks $34 billion revenue for Q3 and $37 billion - $37.5 billion guidance is a more likely outcome, and says its base case is for Nvidia to ship roughly 100,000 Blackwell GPUs in Q4, near the low-end of expectations, though Blackwell ramps should accelerate in the first half of 2025 and see strong demand through 2025. Raymond James views any pullback due to high expectations as a buying opportunity.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that are dominating headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

OpenAI of ChatGPT fame has emerged as the poster child of the AI revolution. The AI models behind the famous AI assistant have, however, started to attract unwanted attention in recent months. For example, news publication The Guardian has reported that a group of major news organizations in Canada have sued the AI firm for allegedly strip-mining journalism and unjustly enriching itself by using news articles to train the popular ChatGPT software. Per the report, the suit was filed in the superior court of justice in Ontario and calls for punitive damages, a share of profits made by OpenAI from using the articles, and an injunction barring the San Francisco-based company from using any of the news articles in the future.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. OpenAI has faced similar suits in recent months but has managed to fight back without incurring financial harm. The latest suit, per the report, includes news platforms like the Globe and Mail, the Canadian Press, the CBC, the Toronto Star, Metroland Media, and Postmedia. The companies want up to C$20,000 in damages for each article used by OpenAI, suggesting a victory in court could be worth billions. As it battles these claims, OpenAI has already signed licensing agreements with a handful of media organizations, including the Associated Press wire service, NewsCorp and Cond\u00e9 Nast.

On November 29, news agency Reuters reported that TSM founder Morris Chang once offered NVIDIA Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang the chance to run the global semiconductor foundry. Per the report, Huang turned down the job. Chang made the revelation in a memoir that will be released soon. The report further added that Chang sought to lure Huang to TSM because of his character, professional experience and expertise in the semiconductor industry.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks analysts are monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe\u2019s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback.Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Earlier this year, Samsung had announced progress in supplying these advanced memory chips to the chipmaker.

Here is a summary of his thoughts: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company\u2019s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don\u2019t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much.    The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company\u2019s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia\u2019s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs. The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia\u2019s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia\u2019s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small.\u00a0 This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier\u2014from \u201cinto 2025\u201d to \u201cmid-2025.\u201d  Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn\u2019t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum. Driving Nvidia\u2019s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, likened this to Moore\u2019s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry\u2019s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia\u2019s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook. Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia\u2019s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate. Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Since the company is expected to provide updates on the demand trend for its AI chips, the earnings event will be of significant interest to investors.\nStock Peaks\nThe value of Nvidia\u2019s stock has grown around 200% since the beginning of the year, and it reached an all-time high last week. Regularly outperforming the broad market, NVDA has been one of the best-performing stocks. Despite the high price, the stock remains a compelling investment option as there seems to be more room for growth.\nIn recent quarters, the GPU giant\u2019s revenues and profit more than doubled year-over-year, driven by the growing demand for its AI chips. For the quarter that ended in October 2024, market watchers project adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share, which represents a year-over-year increase of 100%. The consensus revenue estimate for the third quarter is $32.94 billion, compared to 18.12 billion in Q3 2024. The report is slated for publication on Wednesday, November 20, at 4:20 pm ET.\nTrendsetter \nNvidia\u2019s AI chip development program has been eliciting significant interest among stakeholders in the technology industry due to its potential to revolutionize processes like the training and deployment of AI-powered applications. As a key supplier to major tech companies like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon, Nvidia\u2019s financial performance can serve as an indicator of the AI industry\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia Q2 2025 profit surges on strong revenue growth\n\nFrom Nvidia\u2019s Q2 2025 earnings call:\n\u201cWe plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of DPUs in the near future.

Adjusted profit rose sharply to $0.68 per share in Q2 from $0.27 per share a year earlier. Unadjusted net income was $16.6 billion or $0.67 per share in Q2, compared to $6.19 billion or $0.25 per share in Q2 2024. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue and profit consistently exceeded estimates for about two years.\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s shares opened at $146.78 and traded up 2% in the afternoon.

Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was better than expected at $37.5 billion at the midpoint, 1.3% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.81 per share was 8.6% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Find out in our full research report. Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 CY2024 Highlights: Revenue: $35.08 billion vs analyst estimates of $33.13 billion (93.6% year-on-year growth, 5.9% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs analyst estimates of $0.75 (8.6% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $23.28 billion vs analyst estimates of $21.86 billion (66.3% margin, 6.5% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $37.5 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $37.03 billion Gross Margin (non-GAAP) Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is 73.5%, slightly above analyst estimates of 73.4% Operating Margin: 62.3%, up from 57.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 47.9%, up from 38.9% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 78, down from 81 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $3.60 trillion  \u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. Company Overview Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets. Processors and Graphics Chips The biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles. Sales Growth Reviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one sustains growth for years. Luckily, Nvidia\u2019s sales grew at an incredible 62.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy).   Story Continues   Nvidia Quarterly Revenue  Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Nvidia\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 99.1% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated.  Nvidia Year-On-Year Revenue Growth  This quarter, Nvidia reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 93.6%, and its $35.08 billion of revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 69.7% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 49.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. We still think its growth trajectory is attractive and implies the market is factoring in success for its products and services. Some tapering/deceleration is natural given the magnitude of its revenue base.Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.Product Demand & Outstanding InventoryDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business\u2019 capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production.  Nvidia Inventory Days Outstanding  This quarter, Nvidia\u2019s DIO came in at 78, which is 26 days below its five-year average. At the moment, these numbers show no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.Key Takeaways from Nvidia\u2019s Q3 ResultsWe were impressed by how meaningfully Nvidia exceeded analysts\u2019 revenue, operating income, and EPS expectations this quarter. Demand for its chips, which are seeing major tailwinds from AI, remains extremely robust. Looking ahead, the company gave revenue guidance that topped expectations. However, was the 1% revenue guidance beat enough to get the market excited? Zooming out, we think this was a solid quarter. However, it seems like the magnitude of the guidance beat was a negative in the eyes of the market, and the stock traded down 2.6% to $142.20 immediately following the results.So do we think Nvidia is an attractive buy at the current price? If you\u2019re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates that investors are watching. The chip wars between the United States and China are in full swing. After reports that the US was considering additional curbs on the export of advanced AI chips to Chinese companies, Beijing responded by saying it would take necessary actions to protect Chinese firms if the US escalated chip control measures. According to a report by news agency Reuters, when quizzed about reports that the US was planning to add 200 Chinese firms to a trade blacklist, a Chinese government spokesperson said China strongly opposes the US broadening the concept of national security, and the abuse of control measures targeting Chinese companies.

He Yadong, a commerce ministry spokesman, said that these actions severely disrupt the international economic and trade order, destabilise global industrial security, and harm the cooperative efforts between China and the US, as well as the global semiconductor industry, per Reuters. If the US insists on escalating control measures, China will take necessary actions to resolutely protect the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises, he added. The report adds that the US fears China using chips to strengthen military capabilities.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Faces Supply Strain Amid High Demand from Elon Musk's xAI   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 27, news publication The Wall Street Journal reported that the demand for advanced chips from xAI founder Elon Musk was straining the NVIDIA supply chain. AI startups like xAI have deployed AI chips made by NVIDIA to train their AI models. xAI is looking to compete with other prominent AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. While the latter two are backed by Microsoft and Amazon, xAI is backed by Tesla chief Musk.   Story Continues Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates that investors are watching. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. AI technology has forced businesses worldwide to reconsider their money making models. This revolutionary change is now making its way into the government sector as well. According to a report from news agency Reuters, Mothibi Ramusi, the chief of the communications regulator in South Africa, recently said that the information and communications technology sector needs policy and regulatory changes to keep up with emerging technologies. The country is also debating new regulations for mobile virtual networks and spectrum sharing. The regulator has initiated an inquiry into the licensing framework for satellite-internet providers to provide clear rules for potential operators in the country.

In Japan, multinational conglomerate Softbank has partnered with chipmaker NVIDIA in a partnership that aims to turn communication base stations from cost centers into AI revenue-producing assets. The latter claims that traditional telco networks are built to handle peak loads and usually use only about one-third of their capacity. With AI-RAN, a new communications tech, they can expect to monetize the remaining two-thirds of the capacity for AI inference services. Softbank estimates a return of up to 219% for every AI-RAN server it adds to its infrastructure.

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA)'s RTX 50 Series: The Game-Changer Set to Dominate the Market   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports published by DigiTimes Asia contend that the NVIDIA RTX 50 series display cards, also known famously as Blackwell, are set to launch and suppliers are optimistic about the market impact of these cards. The report claims that Auras Technology, a Taiwan-based cooling components supplier for the chipmaker, has predicted that the latest GPUs may seize the whole market starting in December. Auras Technology expects demand for its cooling products to grow across the PC, GPU, and server markets next year.

Uber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Over the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology. AI systems in these vehicles process data from LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to navigate roads, identify objects, and make decisions in real time.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 27, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a post on publishing platform Medium that the tech industry was focusing on NVIDIA\u2019s AI server and RTX 50 series supply chain. Per the analyst, Vishay, a semiconductor manufacturing firm, was the hidden winner of the focus. The analyst further added that Vishay had secured better-than-expected orders for NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers and RTX 50 series graphics cards.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks on Wall Street's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

(NVDA) Poised for Growth with AI Demand and Analyst Upgrades      Usman Kabir   November 17, 2024 3 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.43%          We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Taking Wall Street By Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm. xAI, the AI startup owned by Elon Musk, is raising more than $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, per a report by news platform CNBC. The bulk of this money, nearly $5 billion, will be raised through sovereign funds in the Middle East. The funding will be used to purchase 100,000 NVIDIA chips, according to the news outlet. xAI plans to build a supercomputer with these chips. This supercomputer would then be integrated with other Musk companies, most notably Tesla, as plans to improve Full Self Driving continue at a rapid pace.  Read more about these developments by accessing\u00a010 Best AI Data Center Stocks\u00a0and\u00a010 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. CNBC claims that the billionaire has started working closely with Donald Trump, the president-elect, on the approach of the new White House administration to AI and tech more broadly. Trump plans on rebranding the CHIPS Act and repealing the Executive Order on AI, two major AI initiatives of US President Joe Biden. The technology world has been dealing with the impact of a change in the US presidency, as Trump is widely expected to increase tariffs on firms doing business with China. He is also expected to urge tech firms in the country to relocate manufacturing operations from overseas to the US.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 14, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $150 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of quarterly results. The advisory sees upside to Q3 results and Q4 outlook led by sustained CSP/enterprise demand for AI accelerators. Further, Oppenheimer sees meaningful acceleration in Blackwell Q1. Conversations with investors suggest buyside modeling 5-6M GPUs next year. The advisory believes Nvidia is best positioned in AI, benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software.

Talha Qureshi   November 29, 2024 6 min read              In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.46%     ^GSPC   -1.02%      We recently published a list of 10 Best Extremely Profitable Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best extremely profitable stocks to buy now. Can the S&P Hit 7,000 By the End of 2025? Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, appeared on CNBC on November 27 to share insights on the market's anticipated performance in 2025. He emphasized the significance of staying invested despite existing risks and high valuations, noting that the economy has shown resilience and interest rates have stabilized.  Yardeni pointed out that many new investors are gravitating toward small and mid-cap sectors, which he considers a sound strategy due to their relative affordability. He also highlighted the S&P 493 stocks as being undervalued compared to the Magnificent Seven, asserting that the overall market outlook remains positive despite potential tariff fluctuations. He believes that tax cuts and deregulation could enhance corporate earnings. Yardeni attributed much of the market's potential growth to an ongoing productivity boom, which he described as still being in its early stages. He noted that productivity levels have improved significantly from nearly zero in 2015 to around 2% currently, with historical precedents suggesting that such booms can reach as high as 4%. This improvement is driven by advancements in technology, which he argues will continue to drive productivity gains.

When discussing whether this boom is primarily driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Yardeni acknowledged AI's importance but also pointed to other technological advancements in cloud computing, robotics, and automation as contributing factors. He identified a shortage of skilled labor as a key driver of productivity growth and explained that technology has enhanced efficiency, allowing wages to rise faster than prices, thus stimulating economic activity. In his concluding remarks, Yardeni projected that the S&P 500 could reach 7,000 by the end of 2025 and potentially hit 10,000 by the end of the decade, reflecting his bullish outlook on market performance fueled by these economic dynamics.

Our Methodology To compile the list of the 10 best extremely profitable stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener, we shortlisted stocks that have grown their revenue and net income by at least 25% over the past 5 years. After sorting our initial list by market cap, we cross-checked the revenue and net income growth rates from Seeking Alpha. We also considered the trailing twelve-month net income and selected stocks that had a trailing twelve-month net income of more than $500 million. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.   Story Continues Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)5 Year Revenue Growth: 62.43%5 Year Net Income Growth: 92.10%TTM Net Income: $53.01 BillionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader when it comes to AI infrastructure. Previously its Gaming Processing Units (GPUs), revolutionized the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. At present its GPUs are powering the AI infrastructure from computers to data centers, autonomous driving vehicles, and robots.While the Gaming segment engine of the company is still running, its application in the data center industry has shifted gears for the company. The company has grown to become the best extremely profitable stock to buy now. It has grown its revenue by 62% and net income by 92% over the past 5 years. Whereas, its trailing twelve-month net income stands at an impressive $53.01 billion.To cater to the growing needs of data centers and artificial intelligence, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) launched its Hopper platform in September 2022, which is a GPU architecture designed to handle high-performance computing. Currently, the Hopper platform demand for data centers is leading the company. During the third quarter results for fiscal 2025, total revenue of $35.1 billion for the company was driven by record year-over-year Data Center revenue growth of 112%.The Data Center segment witnessed its H200 GPU sales increase to double-digit billions of dollars, which the management categorized as the fastest product ramp-up in its history. Moreover, its latest Blackwell platform architecture is also in full production and management anticipates its demand for Blackwell and Hopper platform will continue to increase due to their effective use cases in the artificial intelligence industry.Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cThe fund held an underweight position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) relative to the S&P North American Technology Sector, which was a headwind on performance following impressive returns from the company in 2023 and the first two quarters of 2024. NVIDIA\u2019s stock fell during periods of the quarter after the company reported second quarter earnings. While the earnings came in higher than expectations, investors were concerned that the company did not guide earnings high enough, signaling a potential slowdown in AI buildout. NVIDIA\u2019s demand remains strong and the company has forecast orders for upcoming quarters. The question that remains is whether the company can meet the demand for its AI processors and connectivity chips. Our team continues to remain cautious on NVIDIA\u2019s high customer concentration. Microsoft and Meta have driven a significant amount of the company\u2019s revenue, which presents added risk.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of best extremely profitable stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

Release Date: November 20, 2024 For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript. Positive Points NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $35.1 billion for Q3, up 17% sequentially and 94% year-on-year, surpassing their outlook of $32.5 billion. Data center revenue reached a record $30.8 billion, with a 17% sequential increase and 112% year-on-year growth, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper and H200 products. NVIDIA's AI enterprise revenue is expected to more than double from last year, with a growing pipeline and annualizing software service and support revenue at $1.5 billion, projected to exceed $2 billion by year-end. The company is experiencing significant demand for its new Blackwell GPUs, with plans to exceed previous revenue estimates and ramp up supply to meet customer needs. NVIDIA's gaming revenue increased by 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year, supported by strong back-to-school sales and healthy channel inventory.  Negative Points NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces supply constraints in gaming, which are expected to impact Q4 revenue despite strong sell-through in Q3. Gross margins are expected to moderate to the low 70s as Blackwell ramps up, with initial configurations potentially impacting profitability. Networking revenue was sequentially down, despite strong year-on-year growth, indicating potential challenges in meeting demand for networking components. The company anticipates competitive market conditions in China due to export controls, which could affect future data center revenue from the region. There are concerns about potential digestion phases in hardware deployment cycles, which could impact growth as the market adjusts to new technologies.    Story Continues Q & A HighlightsQ: Can you discuss the debate around whether scaling for large language models has stalled and how NVIDIA is addressing this? A: Jensen Huang, President and CEO, explained that foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and continuing. NVIDIA is helping customers with post-training scaling and inference time scaling, which are driving demand for their infrastructures. The next generation of models starts with 100,000 Blackwells, indicating strong industry movement.Q: There were reports about heating issues with Blackwell. Can you address concerns about your ability to execute the roadmap with Ultra and Rubin? A: Jensen Huang assured that Blackwell production is in full steam, with more units being delivered than previously estimated. The supply chain is robust, and NVIDIA is on track with its annual roadmap, focusing on performance improvements and reducing AI costs.Q: How is Blackwell expected to ramp this year, and how will it affect gross margins? A: Colette Kress, CFO, stated that Blackwell will ramp with initial gross margins in the low 70s, improving to mid-70s as production scales. Jensen Huang added that Blackwell shipments will increase each quarter, with significant demand driven by shifts in computing from CPUs to GPUs.Q: Could NVIDIA recover to mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? A: Colette Kress confirmed that reaching mid-70s gross margin in the second half of next year is a reasonable assumption, depending on the mix of ramp.Q: Can you provide an update on Sovereign AI demand and explain the supply constraints in gaming? A: Colette Kress noted that Sovereign AI demand remains strong, with growth opportunities in regional clouds and AI factories. Gaming supply constraints are due to fast sell-through and efforts to ramp up supply, expected to improve in the new calendar year.For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt? When Is Debt A Problem? Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  How Much Debt Does NVIDIA Carry? The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NVIDIA had debt of US$8.46b at the end of July 2024, a reduction from US$9.71b over a year. But on the other hand it also has US$34.8b in cash, leading to a US$26.3b net cash position.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Debt to Equity History November 16th 2024   A Look At NVIDIA's Liabilities Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$14.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$13.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$34.8b and US$14.1b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$21.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.  Having regard to NVIDIA's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$3.60t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that NVIDIA has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely. Even more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 459% over twelve months. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.   Story Continues Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$26.3b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And we liked the look of last year's 459% year-on-year EBIT growth. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NVIDIA   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Phillip Securities downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $160, up from $155, following the Q3 report. The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Mashaid Ahmed   November 26, 2024 6 min read        1   In This Article: \n                                StockStory Top Pick   NVDA   -2.35%          We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the \u201cTrump trade,\u201d which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump\u2019s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.  The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies. Despite the current market momentum, the bank\u2019s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally. First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms. Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump\u2019s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers.  Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration\u2019s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services. Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies.Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced.On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump\u2019s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes.The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks. With that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months.  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.Our MethodologyTo compile our list of the 12 best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s Hedge Fund database to rank the 12 stocks that are the most popular among elite money managers, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0\u00a0No. of Hedge Funds: 193\u00a0\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global leader in graphics processing technology, powering innovations in gaming, AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles. The company\u2019s GPUs are the gold standard for performance in applications requiring high computational power.NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) journey from a gaming-centric GPU manufacturer to a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) market has culminated in its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI). On November 6, the company was added to the DJI, replacing Intel.\u00a0This milestone, combined with the upcoming launch of its highly anticipated Blackwell processors, positions the company for sustained growth.The imminent release of NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell processors is poised to further solidify the company\u2019s dominance in the AI chip market. The Blackwell GPUs are in high demand among companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta, which are constructing AI data centers to support their offerings. Priced between $30,000 and $40,000 each, these GPUs are already being delivered to data centers and industrial clients for AI applications, with consumer availability expected in 2025. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Jensen Huang stated, \u201cBlackwell is in full production and demand for Blackwell is insane,\u201d emphasizing, \u201cEverybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.\u201dOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. Doug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha founder, talked recently about the issue of scaling in AI on CNBC and said that in the past the improvement of AI models was surging based on the data inputs. However, Clinton referred to the recent reports of AI models hitting a plateau in performance. He believes this issue will be important for AI investors in the coming months and years. \u201cJust to give the quick 101: Over the last few years, what we\u2019ve seen in AI model development is that the more data you put into these models and the more compute you use to train them, the better the models get\u2014very predictable. However, recent reports from OpenAI and Google show that the latest models they\u2019ve trained haven\u2019t been as good as expected based on scaling laws. This has sparked debate in Silicon Valley. Even Sam Altman tweeted about it last week, saying, \u201cThere is no wall,\u201d so maybe it\u2019s not an issue\u2014we\u2019ll see. But I think Jensen really needs to address that question because the 18 to 24-month picture hinges on whether these companies will need to invest in something beyond just compute.\u201d  However, the analyst is bullish on the broader AI market in the long term and believes companies are just getting started in this bull market. \u201cI think if you take a longer-term view\u20142 to 4 years\u2014we\u2019re still very confident we\u2019ll be in an AI bull market. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be pullbacks here and there, but I think we have a long way to go. Companies are really just starting to adopt AI, and we\u2019ll begin to see those revenues over the next year and beyond.\u201d  READ ALSO Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Analyst Recommends Selling Nvidia (NVDA) Amid Growth, Super Micro Concerns: \u2018You Don\u2019t Stay On Top Forever\u2019   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 179 Mark Yusko, Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO & CIO, is recommending investors sell Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Yusko explained his bear thesis on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) during a program on CNBC:   Story Continues \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember that Intel stock went up 20 fold over 10 years because their chip was going to revolutionize AI in 2000 and today that stock is 63% lower than it was 24 years ago. So you don\u2019t stay on top forever and Nvidia came along and invented GPU and now we got TPUs and VPUs and LPUs. So I think innovation will keep rolling but the thing I\u2019m most worried about with Nvidia, their third largest customer is about to get delisted. That\u2019s a big story.\u201d Asked how Super Micro (SMCI) delisting could impact Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), the analyst said:\u201cWell if it\u2019s your third largest customer and they actually haven\u2019t, they don\u2019t have the capacity to continue to be your third largest customer, what happens to your revenue growth and profits growth? I, you know, we\u2019ve seen this movie before with Nell and Cisco back in 2020. So I don\u2019t know, that makes me nervous.\u201d Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for Nvidia anymore. The stock fell despite reporting better-than-expected numbers for the latest quarter. However, analysts are sensing a growth slowdown. Nvidia\u2019s Q4 revenue guidance missed the buy-side whisper number of $39 billion, and the company expects gross margins to keep shrinking next quarter. For Q4, non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 73.5%, down from 75% in Q3. Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers, cloud hyperscalers \u2014 which account for 50% of its revenue \u2014 are increasingly developing in-house AI chips and collaborating with competitors like AMD. This raises concerns about Nvidia\u2019s medium-to-long-term growth in demand and margins.Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\u201cIn a reversal from the past two quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) represented our top relative contributor this quarter, despite the modest underperformance, declining -1.7%. In many ways, NVIDIA was a microcosm of the broader market\u2019s heightened volatility. Beneath the placid surface, the company experienced a 27% drawdown followed by a +31% rally, only to repeat the cycle with a -21% drawdown followed by a subsequent 20% rally to finish the quarter. In our view, the stock\u2019s volatility goes beyond fundamental business drivers, but the company in turn benefitted from increasing capital spending budgets from cloud service providers and large enterprises for generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) infrastructure spending. Simultaneously, the stock endured weakness related to the delayed next-generation Blackwell chip, and an earnings forecast that exceeded expectations, albeit not as much as some investors hoped. While we continue to believe NVIDIA is a highly advantaged business, with significant demand for their chips and servers ahead of the need for that hardware from real-world businesses, we are cautious about its growth sustainability since it lacks recurring revenue.\u201d Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of buzzing AI stocks to watch on latest news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockDisclosure: None.

Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently observed that consumers are no longer focused on brand names but are instead prioritizing companies that offer the best value. Cramer noted that there is a noticeable shift happening in the market, saying: \u201cWe've become a nation of cheapskates. I say that as a compliment. Nobody gets away with charging too much anymore, not in this country, no matter what industry, perhaps even the drug industry.\u201d  He pointed out that this shift is happening rapidly, and many companies are being left behind as consumer behavior changes. Cramer said that he has observed this shift firsthand in various settings, including grocery stores, online, malls, and even the stock market. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Lightning Round: 8 Stocks to Watch Cramer went on to explain that Americans are increasingly fed up with high prices. He said: \u201cThe American people are tired of paying up. They feel gouged, they feel betrayed. They feel that the only thing about brand loyalty is that it isn't worth a dime. They want a better deal. They'll eagerly switch lifetime habits in order to save some money because prices are up so much that you feel like an idiot if you're paying up.\u201d  Reflecting on the market dynamics, Cramer shared his insights from Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Cramer noted that the Dow gained 139 points, the S&P remained flat, and the Nasdaq dipped 0.11%, while the midday trading was much more challenging. He emphasized that the trend toward value is not confined to retail alone but is expanding into other sectors, including tech. At the end, Cramer summed up the situation by saying: \u201cPrices have gotten so high over the past few years that we\u2019re losing our loyalty to brands. These days, this whole country is about one thing: The Benjamins.\u201d  Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on November 20. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.  Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).   Story Continues   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193Cramer mentioned that he never really considered value when it came to tech. Instead, he focused on whether it offered a better solution. He explained that the price of products was primarily determined by one factor: how much the customer was willing to pay. According to him, customers appeared largely indifferent to cost when it came to technology. Talking about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he said:\u201cBut now with NVIDIA, the largest company in the world, by the way, we're seeing something wholly different. We're seeing a company with a product that's incredibly expensive on the one hand, but incredibly cheap on the other. If you're a cloud service provider and you give NVIDIA forty Gs for a version of its latest and greatest chip of Blackwell, you can make five times that. Insanely expensive as a product, dirt cheap as an investment. We keep hearing that NVIDIA's charging too much or the demand is topping out or the stock\u2019s overvalued, but the proof is in the pudding. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported exceptional financial results for the third quarter, far exceeding expectations with $35.1 billion in sales, reflecting a significant 94% increase from the same period last year. The company\u2019s data center segment played a central role in this impressive growth, contributing $30.8 billion, which marks a remarkable 112% year-over-year increase. A large portion of the revenue from this segment came from GPU sales, a key area of strength for the company.In particular, the company\u2019s Blackwell GPU line has seen robust demand. According to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, demand for Blackwell GPUs has been \"staggering\". The company shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers during the third quarter alone.Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\u00a0READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0Disclosure: None.

Looking back at past predictions, especially those made by prominent figures in the investment world, can offer valuable insights into market dynamics and the evolution of technology. In the case of NVIDIA (NVDA), a stock that has seen meteoric rise, revisiting past assessments can shed light on the challenges of predicting future market trends, even for seasoned investors.  On August 5th, several media outlets reported famous activist hedge fund Elliott Management's statements about AI hype and NVDA bubble. We summarized those statements in an article: \"Billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s\u00a0Elliott Management\u00a0has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in \u201cbubble land\u201d and Nvidia is \u201coverhyped.\u201d The fund said in its letter that it\u2019s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is \u201coverhyped with many applications not ready for prime time\u201d. It also claimed that many AI use cases are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d. The $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d of AI other than \u201csummarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding\u201d.    Paul Singer of Elliott Management Elliott's letter was dated July 30th and predicted that the AI bubble will burst when NVDA \" has bad numbers and breaks the spell.\". Here is an excerpt from that letter: \"Speaking of NVIDIA . . .    Story Continues Interestingly NVDA shares hit a low of $92 on August 5th when the Elliott news came out. The stock returned more than 50% since that day, so the bubble must be 50% bigger now. NVDA posted a 17% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth rate, so it doesn't look like the \"AI bubble\" is popping anytime soon. In the meantime, Elliott Associates returned 3.9% during the third quarter.Our research director shared his views on\u00a0NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT:\u00a08 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0and\u00a030 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is focused on this week. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently addressed some of the major events for Wall Street this week, focusing on earnings reports and investor days of various companies. With post-election jitters affecting the market, he warned investors to proceed with caution, as uncertainty looms over the economic landscape.  Cramer referred to Trump\u2019s unpredictable nature, saying, \"He is mercurial. Turns out he\u2019s capricious.\" Reflecting on the mood among investors, Cramer remarked that many were asking themselves, \"What were we thinking?\" as they processed the aftermath of the election. He also noted the unsettling impact of Trump's appointments to key administration positions, saying that \"heads are turning\" in response to some of these picks, and suggested that investors might soon feel the air leaving the post-election optimism that had initially lifted the market. Cramer went on to caution that while there are certainly opportunities in individual stocks, especially in the wake of Trump\u2019s policies, many stocks are still trading at levels far above where they were just a few months ago. He explained: \u201cLook, I\u2019ve told you that there are many pitfalls with individual stocks when it comes to Trump 2.0. Most of them are buying opportunities but with stocks still up so much from a few months ago, you can\u2019t be too eager to buy the dips.\u201d  READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer\u2019s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks Despite new stocks sparking interest, Cramer emphasized that he needed more time to assess market conditions before making any significant moves. He expressed a preference for waiting, stating that he doesn't like to buy stocks only to watch them decline immediately after, a scenario he feels is likely if he rushes in too soon. Cramer concluded by summarizing his outlook on the market, saying: \u201cSo let me give you the bottom line: Even though the post-Trump rally hangover has been vicious, it still hasn't taken most of the market down to levels where I think it makes sense to buy. Now, I just gave you some nuggets. I think they could be golden, but I think it's more important to prepare yourself for better opportunities, at least in the near future.\u201d  Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 15 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them.   Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).  A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)During the episode, Cramer predicted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could have another decline like last quarter for which his advice was to not sell. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\u201cThen after the close Wednesday, we get big and then bigger. Palo Alto Networks and Nvidia\u2026 I think that NVIDIA's last quarter fallout, the huge decline that I told you to buy, not sell, it could occur again because there are so they're just these crazy watch parties, the sunshine soldiers, the people who don't even know what NVIDIA is or does.You know, I love NVIDIA. I always say own it, don't trade it. People don't listen to me. When it goes down, they panic out, I'm trying to stop that. Now, I have to tell you, I think\u2026 if you don't own it, just wait, okay. The stock's struggling here for now. I saw some guy earlier on another of the show saying he's worried about NVIDIA. Well, of course, you're worried about NVIDIA, you always worry about the large ones but I can smell the trader nervousness. I don't want you taking out a trader. Okay, let them sell and then you buy.\u201d As NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) prepares for its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings report, scheduled for November 20, it is gearing up for the release of its new Blackwell architecture. However, recent reports have raised concerns regarding the Blackwell architecture. On Sunday, The Information reported that the new AI chips, which had already faced delays, are encountering overheating issues when used in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips.This overheating problem, particularly when multiple Blackwell GPUs are connected together, has caused some customers to worry about the viability of their data centers and whether they will have enough time to get new systems up and running.Despite these challenges, Cramer expressed confidence on Monday in NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) long-term prospects, suggesting that the recent dip in stock price might present a potential investment opportunity. He said:\u201cMaybe this time really is the top, and it\u2019s all because of server meltdowns\u2026 I actually am more inclined to think you\u2019re getting a buying opportunity in Nvidia thanks to The Information publishing a story that may simply not be that unless you didn't know all that much and you parted with Nvidia as soon as the news came out.\u201d Overall NVDA ranks 11th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is focused on this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.Disclosure: None.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news that broke the internet this week. AI trends are sweeping markets globally. On November 14, TikTok, the popular social media application owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, announced the availability of Symphony Creative Studios, a generative AI video creation platform it has developed, to all advertisers. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the launch is part of a larger plan by the Chinese tech giant to boost its ad business. A press release from the company indicates that some AI features included in the new platform are turning text inputs into videos, generating previews that can be edited to finalize the content, remixing, digital avatar creation, as well as translation and more.

Meanwhile, Foxconn, the Taiwan-based company that is one of the largest contract manufacturers of electronics in the world, announced that it expects robust growth in its artificial intelligence server business next year and will increase investment in several countries amid mounting trade tensions between the US and China. Per a report by Reuters, Young Liu, the chairman of the firm, said after the quarterly earnings results that his firm would be watching to see what policies Donald Trump implements as US president. He added that Foxconn plants in Wisconsin and Texas have seen steady growth in sales on strong demand for AI servers, and the outlook for US operations was positive.

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Surges Amid AI Boom Despite Margin Concerns   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 14, Susquehanna raised the price target on the stock to $180 from $160 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The firm previewed its quarter and expects better results/guidance as checks around H100/H200 and early Blackwell remain on track. However, it notes new products create some uncertainty around margins and the level of dilution.   Story Continues Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of AI news that broke the internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

AI data centers and the power needed to keep them running are some of the hottest topics in the technology space. A new report by management consulting firm Gartner sheds expert light on the matter, AI and GenAI are driving rapid increases in electricity consumption, with data center forecasts over the next two years reaching as high as 160% growth. Gartner claims that 40% of existing AI data centers will be operationally constrained by power availability by 2027. Research from the company indicates that the power required for data centers to run incremental AI-optimized servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year in 2027, which is 2.6 times the level in 2023.  Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Bob Johnson, VP Analyst at Gartner, has said that the explosive growth of new hyperscale data centers to implement GenAI is creating an insatiable demand for power that will exceed the ability of utility providers to expand their capacity fast enough. In turn, per Johnson, this threatens to disrupt energy availability and lead to shortages, which will limit the growth of new data centers for GenAI and other uses from 2026. He added that short-term power shortages are likely to continue for years as new power transmission, distribution and generation capacity could take years to come online and won\u2019t alleviate current problems.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion\u00a0 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 14, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised the price target on the stock to $160 from $138 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of quarterly results. The advisory's FY2025 numbers increase in line with its increased sales forecast for Q3 revenues, with the upside last quarter flowing into Q4. The increase in Wedbush's FY2026 revenue and EPS forecast reflects its confidence around spending into the out year. The advisory's price target lifts in conjunction with the growth in its out-year estimates as Wedbush continues to derive its target by applying a 36-times multiple to its FY2026 EPS.   Story Continues Overall NVDA ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The stock slip comes amid Nvidia\u2019s stellar performance last week, which exceeded expectations. As reported by South China Morning Post, China's Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen met with Nvidia's executive vice president of worldwide field operation responsible for NVIDIA's global business, Jay Puri, on Monday, November 25th. Puri\u2019s meeting highlighted China\u2019s importance as a key market for Nvidia. Meanwhile, Minister Wang Shouwen highlighted opportunities for foreign businesses in an open China, welcoming Nvidia to deepen its ties within the country, according to a statement.   Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Slips Amid Growing Geopolitical and Market Pressure   The meeting comes ahead of an expected escalation of US restrictions on China\u2019s semiconductor industry, which could be announced early this week. It is anticipated that the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden will soon impose another round of export restrictions on China, with new regulations potentially adding up to 200 Chinese chip companies to a trade blacklist, Reuters reports. Moreover, it is expected that further US curbs on shipments of high-bandwidth memory chips to China will be unveiled next month.  It seems that investors are pricing in these risks, with the news adding to market uncertainty. Amid these risks, the challenge for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now lies in living up to the market\u2019s sky-high expectations. Wall Street expects a 54% revenue growth for Nvidia in 2025. While it is true that the demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips continues to gain momentum, minor setbacks or uncertainties can prove detrimental to the stock due to such expectations. If the pressure on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) wasn\u2019t already enough, the chip stock is also competing with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company. With market capitalizations of about $3.5 trillion each, the stakes are high in meeting market expectations. Our research director shared his views on NVDA\u2019s earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

But with this boom has come a big city blues: traffic jams.\nRekor, which offers traffic management and public safety analytics, has a front-row seat to the increasing traffic from an influx of new residents migrating to Austin. Rekor works with the Texas Department of Transportation, which has a $7 billion project addressing this, to help mitigate the roadway concerns.\n\u201cTexas has been trying to meet that growth and demand on the roadways by investing a lot in infrastructure, and they\u2019re focusing a lot on digital infrastructure,\u201d said Shervin Esfahani, vice president of global marketing and communications at Rekor. \u201cIt\u2019s super complex, and they realized their traditional systems were unable to really manage and understand it in real time.\u201d\nRekor, based in Columbia, Maryland, has been harnessing NVIDIA Metropolis for real-time video understanding and NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX modules for edge AI in Texas, Florida, Philadelphia, Georgia, Nevada, Oklahoma and many more U.S. destinations as well as in Israel and other places internationally.\nMetropolis is an application framework for smart infrastructure development with vision AI. It provides developer tools, including the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, pretrained models on the NVIDIA NGC catalog and NVIDIA TensorRT. NVIDIA Jetson is a compact, powerful and energy-efficient accelerated computing platform used for embedded and robotics applications.\nRekor\u2019s efforts in Texas and Philadelphia to help better manage roads with AI are the latest development in an ongoing story for traffic safety and traffic management.\nReducing Rubbernecking, Pileups, Fatalities and Jams\nRekor offers two main products: Rekor Command and Rekor Discover. Command is an AI-driven platform for traffic management centers, providing rapid identification of traffic events and zones of concern. It offers departments of transportation with real-time situational awareness and alerts that allows them to keep city roadways safer and more congestion-free.\nDiscover taps into Rekor\u2019s edge system to fully automate the capture of comprehensive traffic and vehicle data and provides robust traffic analytics that turn roadway data into measurable, reliable traffic knowledge. With Rekor Discover, departments of transportation can see a full picture of how vehicles move on roadways and the impact they make, allowing them to better organize and execute their future city-building initiatives.\nThe company has deployed Command across Austin to help detect issues, analyze incidents and respond to roadway activity with a real-time view.\n\u201cFor every minute an incident happens and stays on the road, it creates four minutes of traffic, which puts a strain on the road, and the likelihood of a secondary incident like an accident from rubbernecking massively goes up,\u201d said Paul-Mathew Zamsky, vice president of strategic growth and partnerships at Rekor. \u201cAustin deployed Rekor Command and saw a 159% increase in incident detections, and they were able to respond eight and a half minutes faster to those incidents.\u201d\nRekor Command takes in many feeds of data \u2014 like traffic camera footage, weather, connected car info and construction updates \u2014 and taps into any other data infrastructure, as well as third-party data. It then uses AI to make connections and surface up anomalies, like a roadside incident. That information is presented in workflows to traffic management centers for review, confirmation and response.\n\u201cThey look at it and respond to it, and they are doing it faster than ever before,\u201d said Esfahani. \u201cIt helps save lives on the road, and it also helps people\u2019s quality of life, helps them get home faster and stay out of traffic, and it reduces the strain on the system in the city of Austin.\u201d\nIn addition to adopting NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack accelerated computing for roadway intelligence, Rekor is going all in on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA AI Blueprints, which are reference workflows for generative AI use cases, built with NVIDIA NIM microservices as part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. NVIDIA NIM is a set of easy-to-use inference microservices for accelerating deployments of foundation models on any cloud or data center while keeping data secure.\nRekor has multiple large language models and vision language models\u00a0 running on NVIDIA Triton Inference Server in production,\u201d according to Shai Maron, senior vice president of global software and data engineering at Rekor.\u00a0\n\u201cInternally, we\u2019ll use it for data annotation, and it will help us optimize different aspects of our day to day,\u201d he said. \u201cLLMs externally will help us calibrate our cameras in a much more efficient way and configure them.\u201d\n\nRekor is using the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization to build AI agents for city services, particularly in areas such as traffic management, public safety and optimization of city infrastructure. NVIDIA recently announced a new AI Blueprint for video search and summarization enabling a range of interactive visual AI agents that extracts complex activities from massive volumes of live or archived video.\nPhiladelphia Monitors Roads, EV Charger Needs, Pollution\nPhiladelphia Navy Yard is a tourism hub run by the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC), which has some challenges in road management and gathering data on new developments for the popular area. The Navy Yard location, occupying 1,200 acres, has more than 150 companies and 15,000 employees, but a $6 billion redevelopment plan there promises to bring in 12,000-plus new jobs and thousands more as residents to the area.\nPIDC sought greater visibility into the effects of road closures and construction projects on mobility and how to improve mobility during significant projects and events. PIDC also looked to strengthen the Navy Yard\u2019s ability to understand the volume and traffic flow of car carriers or other large vehicles and quantify the impact of speed-mitigating devices deployed across hazardous stretches of roadway.\nDiscover provided PIDC insights into additional infrastructure projects that need to be deployed to manage any changes in traffic.\nUnderstanding the number of electric vehicles, and where they\u2019re entering and leaving the Navy Yard, provides PIDC with clear insights on potential sites for electric vehicle (EV) charge station deployment in the future. By pulling insights from Rekor\u2019s edge systems, built with NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX modules for powerful edge processing and AI, Rekor Discover lets Navy Yard understand the number of EVs and where they\u2019re entering and leaving, allowing PIDC to better plan potential sites for EV charge station deployment in the future.\nRekor Discover enabled PIDC planners to create a hotspot map of EV traffic by looking at data provided by the AI platform. The solution relies on real-time traffic analysis using NVIDIA\u2019s DeepStream data pipeline and Jetson. Additionally, it uses NVIDIA Triton Inference Server to enhance LLM capabilities.\nThe PIDC wanted to address public safety issues related to speeding and collisions as well as decrease property damage. Using speed insights, it\u2019s deploying traffic calming measures where average speeds are exceeding what\u2019s ideal on certain segments of roadway.\nNVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX to Monitor Pollution in Real Time\nTraditionally, urban planners can look at satellite imagery to try to understand pollution locations, but Rekor\u2019s vehicle recognition models, running on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX modules, were able to track it to the sources, taking it a step further toward mitigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about air quality,\u201d said Shobhit Jain, senior vice president of product management at Rekor. \u201cWe\u2019ve built models to be really good at that. They can know how much pollution each vehicle is putting out.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Rekor is examining how NVIDIA Omniverse might be used for digital twins development in order to simulate traffic mitigation with different strategies. Omniverse is a platform for developing OpenUSD applications for industrial digitalization and generative physical AI.\nDeveloping digital twins with Omniverse for municipalities has enormous implications for reducing traffic, pollution and road fatalities \u2014 all areas Rekor sees as hugely beneficial to its customers.\n\u201cOur data models are granular, and we\u2019re definitely exploring Omniverse,\u201d said Jain. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see how we can support those digital use cases.\u201d\nLearn about the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for building AI agents for video search and summarization.\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated AnalyticsTags: Metropolis | Social Impact | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Agentic AI takes this one step further \u2014 using sophisticated, autonomous reasoning and iterative planning to help solve complex, multi-step problems.\nAnythingLLM is a customizable open-source desktop application that lets users seamlessly integrate large language model (LLM) capabilities into various applications locally on their PCs. It enables users to harness AI for tasks such as content generation, summarization and more, tailoring tools to meet specific needs.\nAccelerated on NVIDIA RTX AI PCs, AnythingLLM has launched a new Community Hub where users can share prompts, slash commands and AI agent skills while experimenting with building and running AI agents locally.\nAutonomously Solve Complex, Multi-Step Problems With Agentic AI\nAI agents can take chatbot capabilities further. They typically understand the context of the tasks and can analyze challenges and develop strategies \u2014 and some can even fully execute assigned tasks.\nFor example, while a chatbot could answer a prompt asking for a restaurant recommendation, an AI agent could even surface the restaurant\u2019s phone number for a reservation and add reminders to the user\u2019s calendar.\nAgents help achieve big-picture goals and don\u2019t get bogged down at the task level. There are many agentic apps in development to tackle to-do lists, manage schedules, help organize tasks, automate email replies, recommend personalized workout plans or plan trips.\nOnce prompted, an AI agent can gather and process data from various sources, including databases. It can use an LLM for reasoning \u2014 for example, to understand the task \u2014 then generate solutions and specific functions. If integrated with external tools and software, an AI agent can next execute the task.\nSome sophisticated agents can even be improved through a feedback loop. When the data it generates is fed back into the system, the AI agent becomes smarter and faster.\nA step-by-step look at the process behind agentic AI systems. AI agents process user input, retrieve information from databases and other sources, and refine tasks in real time to deliver actionable results.\nAccelerated by NVIDIA RTX AI PCs, these agents can perform inferencing and execute tasks faster than any other PC. Users can operate the agent locally to help ensure data privacy, even without an internet connection.\nAnythingLLM: A Community Effort, Accelerated by RTX\nThe AI community is already diving into the possibilities of agentic AI, experimenting with ways to create smarter, more capable systems.\nApplications like AnythingLLM let developers easily build, customize and unlock agentic AI with their favorite models \u2014 like Llama and Mistral \u2014 as well as with other tools, such as Ollama and LMStudio. AnythingLLM is accelerated on RTX-powered AI PCs and workstations with high-performance Tensor Cores, dedicated hardware that provides the compute performance needed to run the latest and most demanding AI models.\nAnythingLLM is designed to make working with AI seamless, productive and accessible to everyone. It allows users to chat with their documents using intuitive interfaces, use AI agents to handle complex and custom tasks, and run cutting-edge LLMs locally on RTX-powered PCs and workstations. This means unlocked access to local resources, tools and applications that typically can\u2019t be integrated with cloud- or browser-based applications, or those that require extensive setup and knowledge to build. By tapping into the power of NVIDIA RTX GPUs, AnythingLLM delivers faster, smarter and more responsive AI for a variety of workflows \u2014 all within a single desktop application.\nAnythingLLM\u2019s Community Hub lets AI enthusiasts easily access system prompts that can help steer LLM behavior, discover productivity-boosting slash commands, build specialized AI agent skills for unique workflows and custom tools, and access on-device resources.\nExample of a user invoking the agent to complete a Web Search query.\nSome example agent skills that are available in the Community Hub include Microsoft Outlook email assistants, calendar agents, web searches and home assistant controllers, as well as agents for populating and even integrating custom application programming interface endpoints and services for a specific use case.\nBy enabling AI enthusiasts to download, customize and use agentic AI workflows on their own systems with full privacy, AnythingLLM is fueling innovation and making it easier to experiment with the latest technologies \u2014 whether building a spreadsheet assistant or tackling more advanced workflows.\nExperience AnythingLLM now.\nPowered by People, Driven by Innovation\nAnythingLLM showcases how AI can go beyond answering questions to actively enhancing productivity and creativity.

New models include AlphaFold2, which predicts the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence; DiffDock, which predicts the 3D structure of a molecule interacting with a protein; and RFdiffusion, which designs novel protein structures likely to bind with a target molecule.\nThe platform also features BioNeMo Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference AI workflows to help developers scale biomolecular AI models to enterprise-grade applications.\nThe NIM microservice for AlphaFold2 now integrates MMSeqs2-GPU, an evolutionary information retrieval tool that accelerates the traditional AlphaFold2 pipeline by 5x. Led by researchers at Seoul National University, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and NVIDIA, this integration enables protein structure prediction in 8 minutes instead of 40 minutes.\nAt AI Summit Japan, TetraScience, a company that engineers AI-native scientific datasets, announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to industrialize the production of scientific AI use cases to accelerate and improve workflows across the life sciences value chain.\nFor example, choosing an optimal cell line to produce biologic therapies such as vaccines and monoclonal antibodies is a critical but time-consuming step. TetraScience\u2019s new Lead Clone Assistant uses BioNeMo tools, including the NVIDIA VISTA-2D foundation model for cell segmentation and the Geneformer model for gene expression analysis, to reduce lead clone selection to hours instead of weeks.\nTokyo-based Astellas Pharma uses BioNeMo biomolecular AI models such as ESM-1nv, ESM-2nv and DNABERT to accelerate biologics research. Its AI models are used to generate novel molecular structures, predict how those molecules will bind to target proteins and optimize them to more effectively bind to those target proteins.\nUsing the BioNeMo framework, Astellas has accelerated chemical molecule generation\u00a0 by more than 30x. The company plans to use BioNeMo NIM microservices to further advance its work.\nJapan\u2019s Pharma Companies and Research Institutions Advance Drug Research and Development\nAstellas, Daiichi-Sankyo and Ono Pharmaceutical are leading Japanese pharma companies harnessing the Tokyo-1 system, an NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer built in collaboration with Xeureka, a subsidiary of the Japanese business conglomerate Mitsui & Co, to build AI models for drug discovery. Xeureka is using Tokyo-1 to accelerate AI model development and molecular simulations.\nXeureka is also using NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs to explore the application of confidential computing to enhance the ability of pharmaceutical companies to collaborate on large AI model training while protecting proprietary datasets.\nTo further support disease and precision medicine research, genomics researchers across Japan have adopted the NVIDIA Parabricks software suite to accelerate secondary analysis of DNA and RNA data.\nAmong them is the University of Tokyo Human Genome Center, the main academic institution working on a government-led whole genome project focused on cancer research. The initiative will help researchers identify gene variants unique to Japan\u2019s population and support the development of precision therapeutics.\nThe genome center is also exploring the use of Giraffe, a tool now available via Parabricks v4.4 that enables researchers to map genome sequences to a pangenome, a reference genome that represents diverse populations.\nAI Scanners and Scopes Give Radiologists and Surgeons Real-Time Superpowers\nJapan\u2019s healthcare innovators are building AI-augmented systems to support radiologists and surgeons.\nFujifilm has developed an AI application in collaboration with NVIDIA to help surgeons perform surgery more efficiently.\nThis application uses an AI model developed using NVIDIA DGX systems to convert CT images into 3D simulations to support surgery.\nOlympus recently collaborated with NVIDIA and telecommunications company NTT to demonstrate how cloud-connected endoscopes can efficiently run image processing and AI applications in real time. The endoscopes featured NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules for edge computing and connected to a cloud server using the NTT communication platform\u2019s IOWN All-Photonics Network, which introduces photonics-based technology across the network to enable lower power consumption, greater capacity and lower latency.\nNVIDIA is also supporting real-time AI-powered robotic systems for radiology and surgery in Japan with Holoscan, a sensor processing platform that streamlines AI model and application development for real-time insights. Holoscan includes a catalog of AI reference workflows for applications including endoscopy and ultrasound analysis.\nA neurosurgeon at Showa University, a medical school with multiple campuses across Japan, has adopted Holoscan and the NVIDIA IGX platform for industrial-grade edge AI to develop\u00a0 a surgical microscopy application that takes video footage from surgical scopes and converts it into 3D imagery in real time using AI. With access to 3D reconstructions, surgeons can more easily locate tumors and key structures in the brain to improve the efficiency of procedures.\nJapanese surgical AI companies including AI Medical Service (AIM), Anaut, iMed Technologies and Jmees are investigating the use of Holoscan to power applications that provide diagnostic support for endoscopists and surgeons. These applications could detect anatomical structures like organs in real time, with the potential to reduce injury risks, identify conditions such as gastrointestinal cancers and brain hemorrhages, and provide immediate insights to help doctors prepare for and conduct surgeries.\nScaling Healthcare With Digital Health Agents\nOlder adults have higher rates of chronic conditions and use healthcare services the most \u2014 so to keep up with its aging population, Japan-based companies are at the forefront of developing digital health systems to augment patient care.\nFujifilm has launched NURA, a group of health screening centers with AI-augmented medical examinations designed to help doctors test for cancer and chronic diseases with faster examinations and lower radiation doses for CT scans.\nDeveloped using NVIDIA DGX systems, the tool incorporates large language models that create text summaries of medical images. The AI models run on NVIDIA RTX GPUs for inference. Fujifilm is also evaluating the use of MONAI, NeMo and NIM microservices.\n\nTo learn more about NVIDIA\u2019s collaborations with Japan\u2019s healthcare ecosystem, watch the NVIDIA AI Summit on-demand session by Kimberly Powell, the company\u2019s vice president of healthcare.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep Learning | Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | Embedded Computing | Events | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inception | Inference | Robotics | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

With models, datasets and workflows released under shared frameworks, the latest advances are readily available for use without the need to recreate code.\nHugging Face\u2019s leading open AI platform serves more than 5 million machine learning researchers and developers, offering tools and resources to streamline AI development. Hugging Face users can access and fine-tune the latest pretrained models and build AI pipelines on common APIs with over 1.5 million models, datasets and applications freely accessible on the Hugging Face Hub.\nLeRobot, developed by Hugging Face, extends the successful paradigms from its\u00a0 Transformers and Diffusers libraries into the robotics domain. LeRobot offers a comprehensive suite of tools for sharing data collection, model training and simulation environments along with designs for low-cost manipulator kits.\nNVIDIA\u2019s AI technology, simulation and open-source robot learning modular framework such as NVIDIA Isaac Lab can accelerate the LeRobot\u2019s data collection, training and verification workflow. Researchers and developers can share their models and datasets built with LeRobot and Isaac Lab, creating a data flywheel for the robotics community.\nScaling Robot Development With Simulation\nDeveloping physical AI is challenging. Unlike language models that use extensive internet text data, physics-based robotics relies on physical interaction data along with vision sensors, which is harder to gather at scale. Collecting real-world robot data for dexterous manipulation across a large number of tasks and environments is time-consuming and labor-intensive.\nMaking this easier, Isaac Lab, built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, enables robot training by demonstration or trial-and-error in simulation using\u00a0 high-fidelity rendering and physics simulation to create realistic synthetic environments and data. By combining GPU-accelerated physics simulations and parallel environment execution, Isaac Lab provides the ability to generate vast amounts of training data \u2014 equivalent to thousands of real-world experiences \u2014 from a single demonstration.\nGenerated motion data is then used to train a policy with imitation learning. After successful training and validation in simulation, the policies are deployed on a real robot, where they are further tested and tuned to achieve optimal performance.\nThis iterative process leverages real-world data\u2019s accuracy and the scalability of simulated synthetic data, ensuring robust and reliable robotic systems.\nBy sharing these datasets, policies and models on Hugging Face, a robot data flywheel is created that enables developers and researchers to build upon each other\u2019s work, accelerating progress in the field.\n\u201cThe robotics community thrives when we build together,\u201d said Animesh Garg, assistant professor at Georgia Tech. \u201cBy embracing open-source frameworks such as Hugging Face\u2019s LeRobot and NVIDIA Isaac Lab, we accelerate the pace of research and innovation in AI-powered robotics.\u201d\nFostering Collaboration and Community Engagement\nThe planned collaborative workflow involves collecting data through teleoperation and simulation in Isaac Lab, storing it in the standard LeRobotDataset format. Data generated using GR00T-Mimic, will then be used to train a robot policy with imitation learning, which is subsequently evaluated in simulation. Finally, the validated policy is deployed on real-world robots with NVIDIA Jetson for real-time inference.\nThe initial steps in this collaboration have already been taken, having shown a physical picking setup with LeRobot software running on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, providing a powerful, compact compute platform for deployment.\n\u201cCombining Hugging Face open-source community with NVIDIA\u2019s hardware and Isaac Lab simulation has the potential to accelerate innovation in AI for robotics,\u201d said Remi Cadene, principal research scientist at LeRobot.\nThis work builds on NVIDIA\u2019s community contributions in generative AI at the edge, supporting the latest open models and libraries, such as Hugging Face Transformers, optimizing inference for large language models (LLMs), small language models (SLMs) and multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), along with VLM\u2019s action-based variants of\u00a0 vision language action models (VLAs), diffusion policies and speech models \u2014 all with strong, community-driven support.\nTogether, Hugging Face and NVIDIA aim to accelerate the work of the global ecosystem of robotics researchers and developers transforming industries ranging from transportation to manufacturing and logistics.\nLearn about NVIDIA\u2019s robotics research papers at CoRL, including VLM integration for better environmental understanding, temporal navigation and long-horizon planning.

GluFormer\u2019s AI capabilities can further enhance the value of this data, helping clinicians and patients spot anomalies, predict clinical trial outcomes and forecast health outcomes up to four years in advance.\nThe researchers showed that, after adding dietary intake data into the model, GluFormer can also predict how a person\u2019s glucose levels will respond to specific foods and dietary changes, enabling precision nutrition.\nAccurate predictions of glucose levels for those at high risk of developing diabetes could enable doctors and patients to adopt preventative care strategies sooner, improving patient outcomes and reducing the economic impact of diabetes, which could reach $2.5 trillion globally by 2030.\nAI tools like GluFormer have the potential to help the hundreds of millions of adults with diabetes. The condition currently affects around 10% of the world\u2019s adults \u2014 a figure that could potentially double by 2050 to impact over 1.3 billion people. It\u2019s one of the 10 leading causes of death globally, with side effects including kidney damage, vision loss and heart problems.\nGluFormer is a transformer model, a kind of neural network architecture that tracks relationships in sequential data. It\u2019s the same architecture as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models \u2014 in this case generating glucose levels instead of text.\n\u201cMedical data, and continuous glucose monitoring in particular, can be viewed as sequences of diagnostic tests that trace biological processes throughout life,\u201d said Gal Chechik, senior director of AI research at NVIDIA. \u201cWe found that the transformer architecture, developed for long text sequences, can take a sequence of medical tests and predict the results of the next test. In doing so, it learns something about how the diagnostic measurements develop over time.\u201d\nThe model was trained on 14 days of glucose monitoring data from over 10,000 non-diabetic study participants, with data collected every 15 minutes through a wearable monitoring device. The data was collected as part of the Human Phenotype Project, an initiative by Pheno.AI, a startup that aims to improve human health through data collection and analysis.\n\u201cTwo important factors converged at the same time to enable this research: the maturing of generative AI technology powered by NVIDIA and the collection of large-scale health data by the Weizmann Institute,\u201d said the paper\u2019s lead author, Guy Lutsker, an NVIDIA researcher and Ph.D. student at the Weizmann Institute of Science. \u201cIt put us in the unique position to extract interesting medical insights from the data.\u201d\nThe research team validated GluFormer across 15 other datasets and found it generalizes well to predict health outcomes for other groups, including those with prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and obesity.\nThey used a cluster of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs to accelerate model training and inference.\nBeyond glucose levels, GluFormer can predict medical values including visceral adipose tissue, a measure of the amount of body fat around organs like the liver and pancreas; systolic blood pressure, which is associated with diabetes risk; and apnea-hypopnea index, a measurement for sleep apnea, which is linked to type 2 diabetes.\nRead the GluFormer research paper on Arxiv.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | NVIDIA Research | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Kernels are optimized, purpose-built math operations like matrix-multiplies that are at the heart of many deep learning algorithms.\nBlackwell\u2019s higher per-GPU compute throughput and significantly larger and faster high-bandwidth memory allows it to run the GPT-3 175B benchmark on fewer GPUs while achieving excellent per-GPU performance.\nTaking advantage of larger, higher-bandwidth HBM3e memory, just 64 Blackwell GPUs were able to run in the GPT-3 LLM benchmark without compromising per-GPU performance. The same benchmark run using Hopper needed 256 GPUs.\nThe Blackwell training results follow an earlier submission to MLPerf Inference 4.1, where Blackwell delivered up to 4x more LLM inference performance versus the Hopper generation. Taking advantage of the Blackwell architecture\u2019s FP4 precision, along with the NVIDIA QUASAR Quantization System, the submission revealed powerful performance while meeting the benchmark\u2019s accuracy requirements.\nRelentless Optimization\nNVIDIA platforms undergo continuous software development, racking up performance and feature improvements in training and inference for a wide variety of frameworks, models and applications.\nIn this round of MLPerf training submissions, Hopper delivered a 1.3x improvement on GPT-3 175B per-GPU training performance since the introduction of the benchmark.\nNVIDIA also submitted large-scale results on the GPT-3 175B benchmark using 11,616 Hopper GPUs connected with NVIDIA NVLink and NVSwitch high-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU communication and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking.\nNVIDIA Hopper GPUs have more than tripled scale and performance on the GPT-3 175B benchmark since last year. In addition, on the Llama 2 70B LoRA fine-tuning benchmark, NVIDIA increased performance by 26% using the same number of Hopper GPUs, reflecting continued software enhancements.\nNVIDIA\u2019s ongoing work on optimizing its accelerated computing platforms enables continued improvements in MLPerf test results \u2014 driving performance up in containerized software, bringing more powerful computing to partners and customers on existing platforms and delivering more return on their platform investment.\nPartnering Up\nNVIDIA partners, including system makers and cloud service providers like ASUSTek, Azure, Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Giga Computing, Lambda Labs, Lenovo, Oracle Cloud, Quanta Cloud Technology and Supermicro also submitted impressive results to MLPerf in this latest round.\nA founding member of MLCommons, NVIDIA sees the role of industry-standard benchmarks and benchmarking best practices in AI computing as vital. With access to peer-reviewed, streamlined comparisons of AI and HPC platforms, companies can keep pace with the latest AI computing innovations and access crucial data that can help guide important platform investment decisions.\nLearn more about the latest MLPerf results on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: NVIDIA Hopper Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The company has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. Revenue nearly doubled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, Nvidia reported Wednesday. The company expects further revenue growth in the current quarter that ends in January. Investors will be watching to see if demand for the company\u2019s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell can help it maintain the red-hot pace. The company\u2019s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here\u2019s a look. $3.579 trillionNvidia\u2019s total market value as of the close Wednesday, tops in the S&P 500. It regained the No. 1 sport from Apple ($3.461 trillion) earlier this week. Microsoft is the only other company with a market value above $3 trillion ($3.089 trillion). One year ago, Nvidia\u2019s market value was around $1.243 trillion. \n\n195%Gain in Nvidia\u2019s stock price so far this year as of the close of trading Wednesday. A $100,000 investment in Nvidia two years ago would now be worth more than $950,000. Shares fell about 1% in after-hours trading following the release of the company\u2019s earnings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street falls in a manic day after briefly dropping more than 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street tumbles as tariff whiplash and falling AI stocks drag Nasdaq 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street falls again as losses wipe out all post-election gains for the S&P 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25%That\u2019s how much of the S&P 500\u2019s gain for the year could be attributed to Nvidia alone, as of Oct. 31.

Overall revenue rose 94% from a year ago to $35.1 billion. By comparison, revenue growth for all the companies in the S&P 500 is expected to be about 5.5% for the latest quarter, according to FactSet. $37.5 billionNvidia\u2019s estimate for overall revenue in the fourth quarter, \u201cplus or minus 2%.\u201d That translates to a range of $36.8 billion to $38.3 billion, compared to Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $37.1 billion.

Built with NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA NIM microservices, the models were launched today at Indonesia AI Day, a conference focused on enabling AI sovereignty and driving AI-driven digital independence in the country.\nBuilt by Indonesians, for Indonesians, Sahabat-AI models understand local contexts and enable people to build generative AI services and applications in Bahasa Indonesian and various local languages. The models form the foundation of a collaborative effort to empower Indonesia through a locally developed, open-source LLM ecosystem.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence will democratize technology. It is the great equalizer,\u201d said Huang.\u00a0\u201cThe technology is complicated but the benefit is not.\u201d\n\u201cSahabat-AI is not just a technological achievement, it embodies Indonesia\u2019s vision for a future where digital sovereignty and inclusivity go hand in hand,\u201d Sinha said. \u201cBy creating an AI model that speaks our language and reflects our culture, we\u2019re empowering every Indonesian to harness advanced technology\u2019s potential. This initiative is a crucial step toward democratizing AI as a tool for growth, innovation and empowerment across our diverse society.\u201d\nTo accelerate this initiative, IOH \u2014 one of Indonesia\u2019s largest telecom and internet companies \u2014 earlier this year launched \u201cGPU Merdeka by Lintasarta,\u201d an NVIDIA-accelerated sovereign AI cloud. The GPU Merdeka cloud service operates at a BDx Indonesia AI data center powered by renewable energy.\nBolstered by the NVIDIA Cloud Partner program, IOH subsidiary Lintasarta built the high-performance AI cloud in less than three months, a feat that would\u2019ve taken much longer without NVIDIA\u2019s technology infrastructure. The AI cloud is now driving transformation across energy, financial services, healthcare and other industries.\nThe NVIDIA Cloud Partner (NCP) program provides Lintasarta with access to NVIDIA reference architectures \u2014 blueprints for building high-performance, scalable and secure data centers.\nThe program also offers technological and go-to-market support, access to the latest NVIDIA AI software and accelerated computing platforms, and opportunities to collaborate with NVIDIA\u2019s extensive ecosystem of industry partners. These partners include global systems integrators like Accenture and Tech Mahindra and software companies like GoTo and Hippocratic AI, each of which is working alongside IOH to boost the telco\u2019s sovereign AI initiatives.\nDeveloping Industry-Specific Applications With Accenture\nPartnering with leading professional services company Accenture, IOH is developing applications for industry-specific use cases based on its new AI cloud, Sahabat-AI and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nNVIDIA CEO Huang joined Accenture CEO Julie Sweet in a fireside chat during Indonesia AI Day to discuss how the companies are supporting enterprise and industrial AI in Indonesia.\nThe collaboration taps into the Accenture AI Refinery platform to help Indonesian enterprises build AI solutions tailored for financial services, energy and other industries, while delivering sovereign data governance.\nInitially focused on financial services, IOH\u2019s work with Accenture and NVIDIA technologies is delivering pre-built enterprise solutions that can help Indonesian banks more quickly harness AI.\nWith a modular architecture, these solutions can meet clients\u2019 needs wherever they are in their AI journeys, helping increase profitability, operational efficiency and sustainable growth.\nBuilding the Indonesian LLM and Chatbot Services With Tech Mahindra\nBuilt with India-based global systems integrator Tech Mahindra, the Sahabat-AI LLMs power various AI services in Indonesia.\nFor example, Sahabat-AI enables IOH\u2019s AI chatbot to answer queries in the Indonesian language for various citizen and resident services. A person could ask about processes for updating their national identification card, as well as about tax rates, payment procedures, deductions and more.\nThe chatbot integrates with a broader citizen services platform Tech Mahindra and IOH are developing as part of the Indonesian government\u2019s sovereign AI initiative.\nIndosat developed Sahabat-AI using the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing customized LLMs. The team fine-tuned a version of the Llama 3 8B model, customizing it for Bahasa Indonesian using a diverse dataset tailored for effective communication with users.\nTo further optimize performance, Sahabat-AI uses NVIDIA NIM microservices, which have demonstrated up to 2.5x greater throughput compared with standard implementations. This improvement in processing efficiency allows for faster responses and more satisfying user experiences.\nIn addition, NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails open-source software orchestrates dialog management and helps ensure accuracy, appropriateness and security of the LLM-based chatbot.\nMany other service capabilities tapping Sahabat-AI are also planned for development, including AI-powered healthcare services and other local applications.\nImproving Indonesian Healthcare With Hippocratic AI\nAmong the first to tap into Sahabat-AI is healthcare AI company Hippocratic AI, which is using the models, the NVIDIA AI platform and IOH\u2019s sovereign AI cloud to develop digital agents that can have humanlike conversations, exhibit empathic qualities, and build rapport and trust with patients across Indonesia.\nHippocratic AI empowers a novel trillion-parameter constellation architecture that brings together specialized healthcare LLM agents to deliver safe, accurate digital agent implementation.\nDigital AI agents can significantly increase staff productivity by offloading time-consuming tasks, allowing human nurses and medical professionals to focus on critical duties to increase healthcare accessibility and quality of service.\nIOH\u2019s sovereign AI cloud lets Hippocratic AI keep patient data local and secure, and enables extremely low-latency AI inference for its LLMs.\nEnhancing Simplicity, Accessibility for On-Demand and Financial Services With GoTo\nGoTo offers technology infrastructure and solutions that help users thrive in the digital economy, including through applications spanning on-demand services for transport, food, grocery and logistics delivery, financial services and e-commerce.\nThe company \u2014 which operates one of Indonesia\u2019s leading on-demand transport services, as well as a leading payment application in the country \u2014 is adopting and enhancing the new Sahabat-AI models to integrate with its AI voice assistant, called Dira.\nDira is a speech and generative AI-powered digital assistant that helps customers book rides, order food deliveries, transfer money, pay bills and more.\nTapping into Sahabat-AI, Dira is poised to deliver more localized and culturally relevant interactions with application users.\nAdvancing Sustainability Within Lintasarta as IOH\u2019s AI Factory\nFundamentally, Lintasarta\u2019s AI cloud is an AI factory \u2014 a next-generation data center that hosts advanced, full-stack accelerated computing platforms for the most computationally intensive tasks. It\u2019ll enable regional governments, businesses and startups to build, customize and deploy generative AI applications aligned with local language and customs.\nLooking forward, Lintasarta plans to expand its AI factory with the most advanced NVIDIA technologies. The infrastructure already boasts a \u201cgreen\u201d design, powered by renewable energy and sustainable technologies. Lintasarta is committed to adding value to Indonesia\u2019s digital ecosystem with integrated, secure and sustainable technology, in line with the Golden Indonesia 2045 vision.\nBeyond Indonesia, NVIDIA NIM microservices are bolstering sovereign AI models that support local languages in India, Japan, Taiwan and many other countries and regions.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices, NeMo and NeMo Guardrails are available as part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nLearn more about NVIDIA-powered sovereign AI factories for telecommunications.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | Data Science | Deep Learning Institute | Energy | Events | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inference | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Inception | NVIDIA NIM | Open Source | Social Impact | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Among the 53 new to the list, 87% \u2014 46 systems \u2014 are accelerated. Of those accelerated systems, 85% use NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, driving advancements in areas like climate forecasting, drug discovery and quantum simulation.\nAccelerated computing is much more than floating point operations per second (FLOPS). It requires full-stack, application-specific optimization. At SC24 this week, NVIDIA announced the release of cuPyNumeric, an NVIDIA CUDA-X library that enables over 5 million developers to seamlessly scale to powerful computing clusters without modifying their Python code.\nNVIDIA also revealed significant updates to the NVIDIA CUDA-Q development platform, which empowers quantum researchers to simulate quantum devices at a scale previously thought computationally impossible.\nAnd, NVIDIA received nearly a dozen HPCwire Readers\u2019 and Editors\u2019 Choice awards across a variety of categories, marking its 20th consecutive year of recognition.\nA New Era of Scientific Discovery With Mixed Precision and AI\nMixed-precision floating-point operations and AI have become the tools of choice for researchers grappling with the complexities of modern science. They offer greater speed, efficiency and adaptability than traditional methods, without compromising accuracy.\nThis shift isn\u2019t just theoretical \u2014 it\u2019s already happening. At SC24, two Gordon Bell finalist projects revealed how using AI and mixed precision helped advance genomics and protein design.\nIn his paper titled \u201cUsing Mixed Precision for Genomics,\u201d David Keyes, a professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, used 0.8 exaflops of mixed precision to explore relationships between genomes and their generalized genotypes, and then to the prevalence of diseases to which they are subject.\nSimilarly, Arvind Ramanathan, a computational biologist from the Argonne National Laboratory, harnessed 3 exaflops of AI performance on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper-powered Alps system to speed up protein design.\nTo further advance AI-driven drug discovery and the development of lifesaving therapies, researchers can use NVIDIA BioNeMo, powerful tools designed specifically for pharmaceutical applications. Now in open source, the BioNeMo Framework can accelerate AI model creation, customization and deployment for drug discovery and molecular design.\nAcross the TOP500, the widespread use of AI and mixed-precision floating-point operations reflects a global shift in computing priorities. A total of 249 exaflops of AI performance are now available to TOP500 systems, supercharging innovations and discoveries across industries.\nTOP500 total AI, FP32 and FP64 FLOPs by year.\nNVIDIA-accelerated TOP500 systems excel across key metrics like AI and mix-precision system performance. With over 190 exaflops of AI performance and 17 exaflops of single-precision (FP32), NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform is the new engine of scientific computing. NVIDIA also delivers 4 exaflops of double-precision (FP64) performance for certain scientific calculations that still require it.\nAccelerated Computing Is Sustainable Computing\nAs the demand for computational capacity grows, so does the need for sustainability.\nIn the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy-efficient supercomputers, systems with NVIDIA accelerated computing rank among eight of the top 10. The JEDI system at EuroHPC/FZJ, for example, achieves a staggering 72.7 gigaflops per watt, setting a benchmark for what\u2019s possible when performance and sustainability align.\nFor climate forecasting, NVIDIA announced at SC24 two new NVIDIA NIM microservices for NVIDIA Earth-2, a digital twin platform for simulating and visualizing weather and climate conditions. The CorrDiff NIM and FourCastNet NIM microservices can accelerate climate change modeling and simulation results by up to 500x.\nIn a world increasingly conscious of its environmental footprint, NVIDIA\u2019s innovations in accelerated computing balance high performance with energy efficiency to help realize a brighter, more sustainable future.\nSupercomputing Community Embraces NVIDIA\nThe 11 HPCwire Readers\u2019 Choice and Editors\u2019 Choice awards NVIDIA received represent the work of the entire scientific community of engineers, developers, researchers, partners, customers and more.\nThe awards include:\n\nReaders\u2019 Choice: Best AI Product or Technology \u2013 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip\nReaders\u2019 Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology \u2013 NVIDIA Quantum-X800\nReaders\u2019 Choice: Best HPC Server Product or Technology \u2013 NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip\n\u00a0Readers\u2019 Choice: Top 5 New Products or Technologies to Watch \u2013 NVIDIA Quantum-X800\nReaders\u2019 Choice: Top 5 New Products or Technologies to Watch \u2013 NVIDIA Spectrum-X\nReaders\u2019 and Editors\u2019 Choice: Top 5 New Products or Technologies to Watch \u2013 NVIDIA Blackwell GPU\nEditors\u2019 Choice: Top 5 New Products or Technologies to Watch \u2013 NVIDIA CUDA-Q\nReaders\u2019 Choice: Top 5 Vendors to Watch \u2013 NVIDIA\nReaders\u2019 Choice: Best HPC Response to Societal Plight \u2013 NVIDIA Earth-2\nEditors\u2019 Choice: Best Use of HPC in Energy (one of two named contributors) \u2013 Real-time simulation of CO2 plume migration in carbon capture and storage\nReaders\u2019 Choice Award: Best HPC Collaboration (one of 11 named contributors) \u2013 National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot\n\nWatch the replay of NVIDIA\u2019s special address at SC24 and learn more about the company\u2019s news in the SC24 online press kit.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: CUDA | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share.Wall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet.Investors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia\u2019s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. Nvidia said it expects fourth quarter revenue to grow to $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts are expecting, on average, $37.09 billion.\n\n\u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            RELATED COVERAGE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street falls in a manic day after briefly dropping more than 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street tumbles as tariff whiplash and falling AI stocks drag Nasdaq 10% below its record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street falls again as losses wipe out all post-election gains for the S&P 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s third-quarter data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% from a year ago. That growth was driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform for large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications, the company said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 were eyeing Nvidia\u2019s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that\u2019s seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers. Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.On an earnings call Wednesday, Kress told investors that both Hopper GPU and Blackwell systems \u201chave certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery customer is racing to be the first to market,\u201d Kress said. \u201cBlackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\u201dThe company, seen as a bellwether for AI demand, will deliver \u201cmore Blackwells than we had previously estimated\u201d this quarter, Huang added. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang\u2019s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. The company\u2019s third-quarter gaming revenue rose to $3.3 billion, an increase of 15% from a year ago.Nvidia\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance was \u201ca little bit disappointing,\u201d said David Volpe, senior fund manager at Emerald Insights Fund, but the company still had \u201ca tremendous quarter.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing touching it in terms of the growth,\u201d Volpe said.Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia\u2019s path to $4 trillion. Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the earnings report shows \u201cthe AI Revolution is still in the early innings of playing out.\u201d \u201cWe view this as a Nvidia earnings press release that should be hung in the Louvre,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBlackwell demand is just beginning. Any sell off (in Nvidia\u2019s stock) we would view as short lived, with our view this is a $4 trillion market cap in 2025 as the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) drives this spending wave.\u201d\n\nThrough the year\u2019s first six months, Nvidia\u2019s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company\u2019s earnings over the prior 12 months. That\u2019s much more expensive than it\u2019s been historically and than the S&P 500 in general. \u201cThe age of AI is upon us,\u201d Huang said on the call. \u201cAnd it\u2019s large and diverse.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARAH PARVINI\n\n\n                Parvini covers artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.

The new NIM microservices offer climate technology application providers advanced generative AI-driven capabilities to assist in forecasting extreme weather events.\nNVIDIA NIM microservices help accelerate the deployment of foundation models while keeping data secure.\nExtreme weather incidents are increasing in frequency, raising concerns over disaster safety and preparedness, and possible financial impacts.\nNatural disasters were responsible for roughly $62 billion of insured losses during the first half of this year. That\u2019s about 70% more than the 10-year average, according to a report in Bloomberg.\nNVIDIA is releasing the CorrDiff NIM and FourCastNet NIM microservices to help weather technology companies more quickly develop higher-resolution and more accurate predictions. The NIM microservices also deliver leading energy efficiency compared with traditional systems.\nNew CorrDiff NIM Microservices for Higher-Resolution Modeling\nNVIDIA CorrDiff is a generative AI model for kilometer-scale super resolution. Its capability to super-resolve typhoons over Taiwan was recently shown at GTC 2024. CorrDiff was trained on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model\u2019s numerical simulations to generate weather patterns at 12x higher resolution.\nHigh-resolution forecasts capable of visualizing within the fewest kilometers are essential to meteorologists and industries. The insurance and reinsurance industries rely on detailed weather data for assessing risk profiles. But achieving this level of detail using traditional numerical weather prediction models like WRF or High-Resolution Rapid Refresh is often too costly and time-consuming to be practical.\nThe CorrDiff NIM microservice is 500x faster and 10,000x more energy-efficient than traditional high-resolution numerical weather prediction using CPUs. Also, CorrDiff is now operating at 300x larger scale. It is super-resolving \u2014 or increasing the resolution of lower-resolution images or videos \u2014 for the entire United States and predicting precipitation events, including snow, ice and hail, with visibility in the kilometers.\nEnabling Large Sets of Forecasts With New FourCastNet NIM Microservice\nNot every use case requires high-resolution forecasts. Some applications benefit more from larger sets of forecasts at coarser resolution.\nState-of-the-art numerical models like IFS and GFS are limited to 50 and 20 sets of forecasts, respectively, due to computational constraints.\nThe FourCastNet NIM microservice, available today, offers global, medium-range coarse forecasts. By using the initial assimilated state from operational weather centers such as European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providers can generate forecasts for the next two weeks, 5,000x faster than traditional numerical weather models.\nThis opens new opportunities for climate tech providers to estimate risks related to extreme weather at a different scale, enabling them to predict the likelihood of low-probability events that current computational pipelines overlook.\nLearn more about CorrDiff and FourCastNet NIM microservices on ai.nvidia.com.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | SupercomputingTags: Earth-2 \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now, the world\u2019s industries are putting that untamed data to work by building and customizing large language models (LLMs).\nAs 2025 approaches, industries such as healthcare, telecommunications, entertainment, energy, robotics, automotive and retail are using those models, combining it with their proprietary data and gearing up to create AI that can reason.\nThe NVIDIA experts below focus on some of the industries that deliver $88 trillion worth of goods and services globally each year. They predict that AI that can harness data at the edge and deliver near-instantaneous insights is coming to hospitals, factories, customer service centers, cars and mobile devices near you.\nBut first, let\u2019s hear AI\u2019s predictions for AI. When asked, \u201cWhat will be the top trends in AI in 2025 for industries?\u201d both Perplexity and ChatGPT 4.0 responded that agentic AI sits atop the list alongside edge AI, AI cybersecurity and AI-driven robots.\nAgentic AI is a new category of generative AI that operates virtually autonomously. It can make complex decisions and take actions based on continuous learning and analysis of vast datasets. Agentic AI is adaptable, has defined goals and can correct itself, and can chat with other AI agents or reach out to a human for help.\nNow, hear from NVIDIA experts on what to expect in the year ahead:\n\nKimberly Powell\nVice President of Healthcare\nHuman-robotic interaction: Robots will assist human clinicians in a variety of ways, from understanding and responding to human commands, to performing and assisting in complex surgeries.\nIt\u2019s being made possible by digital twins, simulation and AI that train and test robotic systems in virtual environments to reduce risks associated with real-world trials. It also can train robots to react in virtually any scenario, enhancing their adaptability and performance across different clinical situations.\nNew virtual worlds for training robots to perform complex tasks will make autonomous surgical robots a reality. These surgical robots will perform complex surgical tasks with precision, reducing patient recovery times and decreasing the cognitive workload for surgeons.\nDigital health agents: The dawn of agentic AI and multi-agent systems will address the existential challenges of workforce shortages and the rising cost of care.\nAdministrative health services will become digital humans taking notes for you or making your next appointment \u2014 introducing an era of services delivered by software and birthing a service-as-a-software industry.\nPatient experience will be transformed with always-on, personalized care services while healthcare staff will collaborate with agents that help them reduce clerical work, retrieve and summarize patient histories, and recommend clinical trials and state-of-the-art treatments for their patients.\nDrug discovery and design AI factories: Just as ChatGPT can generate an email or a poem without putting a pen to paper for trial and error, generative AI models in drug discovery can liberate scientific thinking and exploration.\nTechbio and biopharma companies have begun combining models that generate, predict and optimize molecules to explore the near-infinite possible target drug combinations before going into time-consuming and expensive wet lab experiments.\nThe drug discovery and design AI factories will consume all wet lab data, refine AI models and redeploy those models \u2014 improving each experiment by learning from the previous one. These AI factories will shift the industry from a discovery process to a design and engineering one.\nRev Lebaredian\nVice President of Omniverse and Simulation Technology\nLet\u2019s get physical (AI, that is): Getting ready for AI models that can perceive, understand and interact with the physical world is one challenge enterprises will race to tackle.\nWhile LLMs require reinforcement learning largely in the form of human feedback, physical AI needs to learn in a \u201cworld model\u201d that mimics the laws of physics. Large-scale physically based simulations are allowing the world to realize the value of physical AI through robots by accelerating the training of physical AI models and enabling continuous training in robotic systems across every industry.\nCheaper by the dozen: In addition to their smarts (or lack thereof), one big factor that has slowed adoption of humanoid robots has been affordability. As agentic AI brings new intelligence to robots, though, volume will pick up and costs will come down sharply. The average cost of industrial robots is expected to drop to $10,800 in 2025, down sharply from $46K in 2010 to $27K in 2017. As these devices become significantly cheaper, they\u2019ll become as commonplace across industries as mobile devices are.\nDeepu Talla\nVice President of Robotics and Edge Computing\nRedefining robots: When people think of robots today, they\u2019re usually images or content showing autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), manipulator arms or humanoids. But tomorrow\u2019s robots are set to be an autonomous system that perceives, reasons, plans and acts \u2014 then learns.\nSoon we\u2019ll be thinking of robots embodied everywhere from surgical rooms and data centers to warehouses and factories. Even traffic control systems or entire cities will be transformed from static, manually operated systems to autonomous, interactive systems embodied by physical AI.\nThe rise of small language models: To improve the functionality of robots operating at the edge, expect to see the rise of small language models that are energy-efficient and avoid latency issues associated with sending data to data centers. The shift to small language models in edge computing will improve inference in a range of industries, including automotive, retail and advanced robotics.\nKevin Levitt\nGlobal Director of Financial Services\nAI agents boost firm operations: AI-powered agents will be deeply integrated into the financial services ecosystem, improving customer experiences, driving productivity and reducing operational costs.\nAI agents will take every form based on each financial services firm\u2019s needs. Human-like 3D avatars will take requests and interact directly with clients, while text-based chatbots will summarize thousands of pages of data and documents in seconds to deliver accurate, tailored insights to employees across all business functions.\nAI factories become table stakes: AI use cases in the industry are exploding. This includes improving identity verification for anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations, reducing false positives for transaction fraud and generating new trading strategies to improve market returns. AI also is automating document management, reducing funding cycles to help consumers and businesses on their financial journeys.\nTo capitalize on opportunities like these, financial institutions will build AI factories that use full-stack accelerated computing to maximize performance and utilization to build AI-enabled applications that serve hundreds, if not thousands, of use cases \u2014 helping set themselves apart from the competition.\nAI-assisted data governance: Due to the sensitive nature of financial data and stringent regulatory requirements, governance will be a priority for firms as they use data to create reliable and legal AI applications, including for fraud detection, predictions and forecasting, real-time calculations and customer service.\nFirms will use AI models to assist in the structure, control, orchestration, processing and utilization of financial data, making the process of complying with regulations and safeguarding customer privacy smoother and less labor intensive. AI will be the key to making sense of and deriving actionable insights from the industry\u2019s stockpile of underutilized, unstructured data.\nRichard Kerris\nVice President of Media and Entertainment\nLet AI entertain you: AI will continue to revolutionize entertainment with hyperpersonalized content on every screen, from TV shows to live sports. Using generative AI and advanced vision-language models, platforms will offer immersive experiences tailored to individual tastes, interests and moods. Imagine teaser images and sizzle reels crafted to capture the essence of a new show or live event and create an instant personal connection.\nIn live sports, AI will enhance accessibility and cultural relevance, providing language dubbing, tailored commentary and local adaptations. AI will also elevate binge-watching by adjusting pacing, quality and engagement options in real time to keep fans captivated. This new level of interaction will transform streaming from a passive experience into an engaging journey that brings people closer to the action and each other.\nAI-driven platforms will also foster meaningful connections with audiences by tailoring recommendations, trailers and content to individual preferences. AI\u2019s hyperpersonalization will allow viewers to discover hidden gems, reconnect with old favorites and feel seen. For the industry, AI will drive growth and innovation, introducing new business models and enabling global content strategies that celebrate unique viewer preferences, making entertainment feel boundless, engaging and personally crafted.\nRonnie Vasishta\nSenior Vice President of Telecoms\nThe AI connection: Telecommunications providers will begin to deliver generative AI applications and 5G connectivity over the same network. AI radio access network (AI-RAN) will enable telecom operators to transform traditional single-purpose base stations from cost centers into revenue-producing assets capable of providing AI inference services to devices, while more efficiently delivering the best network performance.\nAI agents to the rescue: The telecommunications industry will be among the first to dial into agentic AI to perform key business functions. Telco operators will use AI agents for a wide variety of tasks, from suggesting money-saving plans to customers and troubleshooting network connectivity, to answering billing questions and processing payments.\nMore efficient, higher-performing networks: AI also will be used at the wireless network layer to enhance efficiency, deliver site-specific learning and reduce power consumption. Using AI as an intelligent performance improvement tool, operators will be able to continuously observe network traffic, predict congestion patterns and make adjustments before failures happen, allowing for optimal network performance.\nAnswering the call on sovereign AI: Nations will increasingly turn to telcos \u2014 which have proven experience managing complex, distributed technology networks \u2014 to achieve their sovereign AI objectives. The trend will spread quickly across Europe and Asia, where telcos in Switzerland, Japan, Indonesia and Norway are already partnering with national leaders to build AI factories that can use proprietary, local data to help researchers, startups, businesses and government agencies create AI applications and services.\nXinzhou Wu\nVice President of Automotive\nPedal to generative AI metal: Autonomous vehicles will become more performant as developers tap into advancements in generative AI. For example, harnessing foundation models, such as vision language models, provides an opportunity to use internet-scale knowledge to solve one of the hardest problems in the autonomous vehicle (AV) field, namely that of efficiently and safely reasoning through rare corner cases.\nSimulation unlocks success: More broadly, new AI-based tools will enable breakthroughs in how AV development is carried out. For example, advances in generative simulation will enable the scalable creation of complex scenarios aimed at stress-testing vehicles for safety purposes. Aside from allowing for testing unusual or dangerous conditions, simulation is also essential for generating synthetic data to enable end-to-end model training.\nThree-computer approach: Effectively, new advances in AI will catalyze AV software development across the three key computers underpinning AV development \u2014 one for training the AI-based stack in the data center, another for simulation and validation, and a third in-vehicle computer to process real-time sensor data for safe driving. Together, these systems will enable continuous improvement of AV software for enhanced safety and performance of cars, trucks, robotaxis and beyond.\nMarc Spieler\nSenior Managing Director of Global Energy Industry\nWelcoming the smart grid: Do you know when your daily peak home electricity is? You will soon as utilities around the world embrace smart meters that use AI to broadly manage their grid networks, from big power plants and substations and, now, into the home.\nAs the smart grid takes shape, smart meters \u2014 once deemed too expensive to be installed in millions of homes \u2014 that combine software, sensors and accelerated computing will alert utilities when trees in a backyard brush up against power lines or when to offer big rebates to buy back the excess power stored through rooftop solar installations.\nPowering up: Delivering the optimal power stack has always been mission-critical for the energy industry. In the era of generative AI, utilities will address this issue in ways that reduce environmental impact.\nExpect in 2025 to see a broader embrace of nuclear power as one clean-energy path the industry will take. Demand for natural gas also will grow as it replaces coal and other forms of energy. These resurgent forms of energy are being helped by the increased use of accelerated computing, simulation technology and AI and 3D visualization, which helps optimize design, pipeline flows and storage. We\u2019ll see the same happening at oil and gas companies, which are looking to reduce the impact of energy exploration and production.\nAzita Martin\nVice President of Retail, Consumer-Packaged Goods and Quick-Service Restaurants\u00a0\nSoftware-defined retail: Supercenters and grocery stores will become software-defined, each running computer vision and sophisticated AI algorithms at the edge. The transition will accelerate checkout, optimize merchandising and reduce shrink \u2014 the industry term for a product being lost or stolen.\nEach store will be connected to a headquarters AI network, using collective data to become a perpetual learning machine. Software-defined stores that continually learn from their own data will transform the shopping experience.\nIntelligent supply chain: Intelligent supply chains created using digital twins, generative AI, machine learning and AI-based solvers will drive billions of dollars in labor productivity and operational efficiencies. Digital twin simulations of stores and distribution centers will optimize layouts to increase in-store sales and accelerate throughput in distribution centers.\nAgentic robots working alongside associates will load and unload trucks, stock shelves and pack customer orders. Also, last-mile delivery will be enhanced with AI-based routing optimization solvers, allowing products to reach customers faster while reducing vehicle fuel costs.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Driving | Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Energy | Financial Services | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Media and Entertainment | Omniverse | Physical AI | Retail | Robotics | Telecommunications \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The faster they can work through their data, the quicker they can make decisions about promising data points, trends worth investigating and adjustments to their experiments.\nTo make the leap to accelerated computing, researchers don\u2019t need expertise in computer science. They can simply write code using the familiar NumPy interface or apply cuPyNumeric to existing code, following best practices for performance and scalability.\nOnce cuPyNumeric is applied, they can run their code on one or thousands of GPUs with zero code changes.\nThe latest version of cuPyNumeric, now available on Conda and GitHub, offers support for the NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, automatic resource configuration at run time and improved memory scaling. It also supports HDF5, a popular file format in the scientific community that helps efficiently manage large, complex data.\nResearchers at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Australia National University, UMass Boston, the Center for Turbulence Research at Stanford University and the National Payments Corporation of India are among those who have integrated cuPyNumeric to achieve significant improvements in their data analysis workflows.\nLess Is More: Limitless GPU Scalability Without Code Changes\nPython is the most common programming language for data science, machine learning and numerical computing, used by millions of researchers in scientific fields including astronomy, drug discovery, materials science and nuclear physics. Tens of thousands of packages on GitHub depend on the NumPy math and matrix library, which had over 300 million downloads last month. All of these applications could benefit from accelerated computing with cuPyNumeric.\nMany of these scientists build programs that use NumPy and run on a single CPU-only node \u2014 limiting the throughput of their algorithms to crunch through increasingly large datasets collected by instruments like electron microscopes, particle colliders and radio telescopes.\ncuPyNumeric helps researchers keep pace with the growing size and complexity of their datasets by providing a drop-in replacement for NumPy that can scale to thousands of GPUs. cuPyNumeric doesn\u2019t require code changes when scaling from a single GPU to a whole supercomputer. This makes it easy for researchers to run their analyses on accelerated computing systems of any size.\nSolving the Big Data Problem, Accelerating Scientific Discovery\nResearchers at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy lab operated by Stanford University, have found that cuPyNumeric helps them speed up X-ray experiments conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source.\nA SLAC team focused on materials science discovery for semiconductors found that cuPyNumeric accelerated its data analysis application by 6x, decreasing run time from minutes to seconds. This speedup allows the team to run important analyses in parallel when conducting experiments at this highly specialized facility.\nBy using experiment hours more efficiently, the team anticipates it will be able to discover new material properties, share results and publish work more quickly.\nOther institutions using cuPyNumeric include:\u00a0\n\nAustralia National University, where researchers used cuPyNumeric to scale the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to run on multi-GPU systems at the country\u2019s National Computational Infrastructure. While the algorithm can be used for many applications, the researchers\u2019 initial target is large-scale climate and weather models.\nLos Alamos National Laboratory, where researchers are applying cuPyNumeric to accelerate data science, computational science and machine learning algorithms. cuPyNumeric will provide them with additional tools to effectively use the recently launched Venado supercomputer, which features over 2,500 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips.\nStanford University\u2019s Center for Turbulence Research, where researchers are developing Python-based computational fluid dynamics solvers that can run at scale on large accelerated computing clusters using cuPyNumeric. These solvers can seamlessly integrate large collections of fluid simulations with popular machine learning libraries like PyTorch, enabling complex applications including online training and reinforcement learning.\nUMass Boston, where a research team is accelerating linear algebra calculations to analyze microscopy videos and determine the energy dissipated by active materials. The team used cuPyNumeric to decompose a matrix of 16 million rows and 4,000 columns.\nNational Payments Corporation of India, the organization behind a real-time digital payment system used by around 250 million Indians daily and expanding globally. NPCI uses complex matrix calculations to track transaction paths between payers and payees. With current methods, it takes about 5 hours to process data for a one-week transaction window on CPU systems. A trial showed that applying cuPyNumeric to accelerate the calculations on multi-node NVIDIA DGX systems could speed up matrix multiplication by 50x, enabling NPCI to process larger transaction windows in less than an hour and detect suspected money laundering in near real time.\n\nTo learn more about cuPyNumeric, see a live demo in the NVIDIA booth at the Supercomputing 2024 conference in Atlanta, join the theater talk in the expo hall and participate in the cuPyNumeric workshop.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWatch the NVIDIA special address at SC24.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Research | Software | SupercomputingTags: Aerospace | Artificial Intelligence | Events | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | Science \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Novel materials are typically discovered through laborious, trial-and-error synthesis and testing in a traditional lab.\nMany of today\u2019s plastics, for example, are still based on material discoveries made in the mid-1900s.\nMore recently, AI has emerged as a promising accelerant for chemicals and materials innovation.\nWith the new ALCHEMI NIM microservice, researchers can test chemical compounds and material stability in simulation, in a virtual AI lab, which reduces costs, energy consumption and time to discovery.\nFor example, running MACE-MP-0, a pretrained foundation model for materials chemistry, on an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, the new NIM microservice speeds evaluations of a potential composition\u2019s simulated long-term stability 100x. The below figure shows a 25x speedup from using the NVIDIA Warp Python framework for high-performance simulation, followed by a 4x speedup with in-flight batching. All in all, evaluating 16 million structures would have taken months \u2014 with the NIM microservice, it can be done in just hours.\n\nBy letting scientists examine more structures in less time, the NIM microservice can boost research on materials for use with solar and electric batteries, for example, to bolster the renewable energy transition.\nNVIDIA also plans to release NIM microservices that can be used to simulate the manufacturability of novel materials \u2014 to determine how they might be brought from test tubes into the real world in the form of batteries, solar panels, fertilizers, pesticides and other essential products that can contribute to a healthier, greener planet.\nSES AI, a leading developer of lithium-metal batteries, is using the NVIDIA ALCHEMI NIM microservice with the AIMNet2 model to accelerate the identification of electrolyte materials used for electric vehicles.\n\u201cSES AI is dedicated to advancing lithium battery technology through AI-accelerated material discovery, using our Molecular Universe Project to explore and identify promising candidates for lithium metal electrolyte discovery,\u201d said Qichao Hu, CEO of SES AI. \u201cUsing the ALCHEMI NIM microservice with AIMNet2 could drastically improve our ability to map molecular properties, reducing time and costs significantly and accelerating innovation.\u201d\nSES AI recently mapped 100,000 molecules in half a day, with the potential to achieve this in under an hour using ALCHEMI. This signals how the microservice is poised to have a transformative impact on material screening efficiency.\nLooking ahead, SES AI aims to map the properties of up to 10 billion molecules within the next couple of years, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven, high-throughput discovery.\nThe new microservice will soon be available for researchers to test for free through the NVIDIA NGC catalog \u2014 be notified of ALCHEMI\u2019s launch. It will also be downloadable from build.nvidia.com, and the production-grade NIM microservice will be offered through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.\nLearn more about the NVIDIA ALCHEMI NIM microservice, and hear the latest on how AI and supercomputing are supercharging researchers and developers\u2019 workflows by joining NVIDIA at SC24, running through Friday, Nov. 22.\nSee notice regarding software product information.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Climate | Energy | GPU | Inference | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NIM | Science | Scientific Visualization | Social Impact | Supercomputing | Sustainability \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today, over 600 Windows apps and games are already running AI locally on more than 100 million GeForce RTX AI PCs worldwide, delivering fast, reliable and low-latency performance.\nAt Microsoft Ignite, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced tools to help Windows developers quickly build and optimize AI-powered apps on RTX AI PCs, making local AI more accessible. These new tools enable application and game developers to harness powerful RTX GPUs to accelerate complex AI workflows for applications such as AI agents, app assistants and digital humans.\nRTX AI PCs Power Digital Humans With Multimodal Small Language Models\nMeet James, an interactive digital human knowledgeable about NVIDIA and its products. James uses a collection of NVIDIA NIM microservices, NVIDIA ACE and ElevenLabs digital human technologies to provide natural and immersive responses.\nNVIDIA ACE is a suite of digital human technologies that brings life to agents, assistants and avatars. To achieve a higher level of understanding so that they can respond with greater context-awareness, digital humans must be able to visually perceive the world like humans do.\nEnhancing digital human interactions with greater realism demands technology that enables perception and understanding of their surroundings with greater nuance. To achieve this, NVIDIA developed multimodal small language models that can process both text and imagery, excel in role-playing and are optimized for rapid response times.\nThe NVIDIA Nemovision-4B-Instruct model, soon to be available, uses the latest NVIDIA VILA and NVIDIA NeMo framework for distilling, pruning and quantizing to become small enough to perform on RTX GPUs with the accuracy developers need.\nThe model enables digital humans to understand visual imagery in the real world and on the screen to deliver relevant responses. Multimodality serves as the foundation for agentic workflows and offers a sneak peek into a future where digital humans can reason and take action with minimal assistance from a user.\nNVIDIA is also introducing the Mistral NeMo Minitron 128k Instruct family, a suite of large-context small language models designed for optimized, efficient digital human interactions, coming soon. Available in 8B-, 4B- and 2B-parameter versions, these models offer flexible options for balancing speed, memory usage and accuracy on RTX AI PCs. They can handle large datasets in a single pass, eliminating the need for data segmentation and reassembly. Built in the GGUF format, these models enhance efficiency on low-power devices and support compatibility with multiple programming languages.\nTurbocharge Gen AI With NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer for Windows\u00a0\nWhen bringing models to PC environments, developers face the challenge of limited memory and compute resources for running AI locally. And they want to make models available to as many people as possible, with minimal accuracy loss.\nToday, NVIDIA announced updates to NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer (ModelOpt) to offer Windows developers an improved way to optimize models for ONNX Runtime deployment.\nWith the latest updates, TensorRT ModelOpt enables models to be optimized into an ONNX checkpoint for deploying the model within ONNX runtime environments \u2014 using GPU execution providers such as CUDA, TensorRT and DirectML.\nTensorRT-ModelOpt includes advanced quantization algorithms, such as INT4-Activation Aware Weight Quantization. Compared to other tools such as Olive, the new method reduces the memory footprint of the model and improves throughput performance on RTX GPUs.\nDuring deployment, the models can have up to 2.6x reduced memory footprint compared to FP16 models. This results in faster throughput, with minimal accuracy degradation, allowing them to run on a wider range of PCs.\nLearn more about how developers on Microsoft systems, from Windows RTX AI PCs to NVIDIA Blackwell-powered Azure servers, are transforming how users interact with AI on a daily basis.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: AI Decoded | Artificial Intelligence | GeForce | NVIDIA RTX \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On Thursday, the California chipmaker reported third-quarter revenue of $13.3 billion, down 6% from the same period last year. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said at the time that the company is \u201cacting with urgency\u201d on a plan to reduce costs and simplify its portfolio. By contrast, Nvidia\u2019s shares have risen more than 173% this year to a price of $135.40.Unlike Intel, Nvidia designs but doesn\u2019t manufacture its own chips, relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, an Intel rival.In another index, the Dow Jones Utility Average, Texas-based energy company Vistra will replace Virginia-based AES Corp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA staff return to crowded offices, broken equipment and missing chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\nEnterprises and public sector organizations around the world are developing AI agents to boost the capabilities of workforces that rely on visual information from a growing number of devices \u2014 including cameras, IoT sensors and vehicles.\nTo support their work, a new NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization will enable developers in virtually any industry to build video analytics AI agents that analyze video and image content. These agents can answer user questions, generate summaries and enable alerts for specific scenarios.\nPart of NVIDIA Metropolis, a set of developer tools for building vision AI applications, the blueprint is a customizable workflow that combines NVIDIA computer vision and generative AI technologies.\nGlobal systems integrators and technology solutions providers including Accenture, Dell Technologies and Lenovo are bringing the NVIDIA Blueprint for visual search and summarization to businesses and cities worldwide, jump-starting the next wave of AI applications that can be deployed to boost productivity and safety in factories, warehouses, shops, airports, traffic intersections and more.\nAnnounced ahead of the Smart City Expo World Congress, the NVIDIA Blueprint gives visual computing developers a full suite of optimized software for building and deploying generative AI-powered agents that can ingest and understand massive volumes of live video streams or data archives.\nUsers can customize these video analytics AI agents with natural language prompts instead of rigid software code, lowering the barrier to deploying virtual assistants across industries and smart city applications.\n\nNVIDIA Blueprint Harnesses Vision Language Models\nVideo analytics AI agents are powered by vision language models (VLMs), a class of generative AI models that combine computer vision and language understanding to interpret the physical world and perform reasoning tasks.\nThe NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization can be configured with NVIDIA NIM microservices for VLMs like the NVIDIA Cosmos Nemotron models, LLMs like the NVIDIA Llama Nemotron models, and AI models for GPU-accelerated question answering and context-aware retrieval-augmented generation. Developers can easily swap in other VLMs, LLMs and graph databases and fine-tune them using the NVIDIA NeMo platform for their unique environments and use cases.\nAdopting the NVIDIA Blueprint could save developers months of effort on investigating and optimizing generative AI models for smart city applications. Deployed on NVIDIA GPUs at the edge, on premises or in the cloud, it can vastly accelerate the process of combing through video archives to identify key moments.\nIn a warehouse environment, an AI agent built with this workflow could alert workers if safety protocols are breached. At busy intersections, an AI agent could identify traffic collisions and generate reports to aid emergency response efforts. And in the field of public infrastructure, maintenance workers could ask AI agents to review aerial footage and identify degrading roads, train tracks or bridges to support proactive maintenance.\nBeyond smart spaces, video analytics AI agents could also be used to summarize videos for people with impaired vision, automatically generate recaps of sporting events and help label massive visual datasets to train other AI models.\nThe video search and summarization workflow joins a collection of NVIDIA Blueprints that make it easy to create AI-powered digital avatars, build virtual assistants for personalized customer service and extract enterprise insights from PDF data.\nNVIDIA Blueprints are free for developers to experience and download, and can be deployed in production across accelerated data centers and clouds with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, an end-to-end software platform that accelerates data science pipelines and streamlines generative AI development and deployment.\nAI Agents to Deliver Insights From Warehouses to World Capitals\nEnterprise and public sector customers can also harness the full collection of NVIDIA Blueprints with the help of NVIDIA\u2019s partner ecosystem.\nGlobal professional services company Accenture has integrated NVIDIA Blueprints into its Accenture AI Refinery, which is built on NVIDIA AI Foundry and enables customers to develop custom AI models trained on enterprise data.\nGlobal systems integrators in Southeast Asia \u2014 including ITMAX in Malaysia and FPT in Vietnam \u2014 are building AI agents based on the video search and summarization NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city and intelligent transportation applications.\nDevelopers can also build and deploy NVIDIA Blueprints on NVIDIA AI platforms with compute, networking and software provided by global server manufacturers.\nDell will use VLM and agent approaches with Dell\u2019s NativeEdge platform to enhance existing edge AI applications and create new edge AI-enabled capabilities. Dell Reference Designs for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA and the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization will support VLM capabilities in dedicated AI workflows for data center, edge and on-premises multimodal enterprise use cases.\nNVIDIA Blueprints are also incorporated in Lenovo Hybrid AI solutions powered by NVIDIA.\nCompanies like K2K, a smart city application provider in the NVIDIA Metropolis ecosystem, will use the new NVIDIA Blueprint to build AI agents that analyze live traffic cameras in real time. This will enable city officials to ask questions about street activity and receive recommendations on ways to improve operations. The company also is working with city traffic managers in Palermo, Italy, to deploy video analytics AI agents using NIM microservices and NVIDIA Blueprints.\nDiscover more about the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization by visiting the NVIDIA booth at the Smart Cities Expo World Congress, taking place in Barcelona through Nov. 7.\nLearn how to build a video analytics AI agent and get started with the blueprint.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | RoboticsTags: Artificial Intelligence | Computer Vision | Digital Twin | Industrial and Manufacturing | Metropolis | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NIM | Smart Spaces | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This will help overcome the current limitations of quantum computing hardware, which can only run a certain number of quantum operations before computations must cease, due to what researchers call \u201cnoise.\u201d\n\u201cThe development of commercially useful quantum computers is only possible if we can scale up quantum hardware while keeping noise in check,\u201d said Guifre Vidal, research scientist from Google Quantum AI. \u201cUsing NVIDIA accelerated computing, we\u2019re exploring the noise implications of increasingly larger quantum chip designs.\u201d\nUnderstanding noise in quantum hardware designs requires complex dynamical simulations capable of fully capturing how qubits within a quantum processor interact with their environment.\nThese simulations have traditionally been prohibitively computationally expensive to pursue. Using the CUDA-Q platform, however, Google can employ 1,024 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs at the NVIDIA Eos supercomputer to perform one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest dynamical simulation of quantum devices \u2014 at a fraction of the cost.\n\u201cAI supercomputing power will be helpful to quantum computing\u2019s success,\u201d said Tim Costa, director of quantum and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cGoogle\u2019s use of the CUDA-Q platform demonstrates the central role GPU-accelerated simulations have in advancing quantum computing to help solve real-world problems.\u201d\nWith CUDA-Q and H100 GPUs, Google can perform fully comprehensive, realistic simulations of devices containing 40 qubits \u2014 the largest-performed simulations of this kind. The simulation techniques provided by CUDA-Q mean noisy simulations that would have taken a week can now run in minutes.\nThe software powering these accelerated dynamic simulations will be publicly available in the CUDA-Q platform, allowing quantum hardware engineers to rapidly scale their system designs.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, NVIDIA Eos supercomputer, and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs; Google using our products and technologies, the benefits and impact thereof, and the features, performance and availability of its offerings; and AI\u00a0supercomputing\u00a0power being helpful to quantum computing\u2019s success are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

H200 NVL is ideal for organizations with data centers looking for lower-power, air-cooled enterprise rack designs with flexible configurations to deliver acceleration for every AI and HPC workload, regardless of size.\nAccording to a recent survey, roughly 70% of enterprise racks are 20kW and below and use air cooling. This makes PCIe GPUs essential, as they provide granularity of node deployment, whether using one, two, four or eight GPUs \u2014 enabling data centers to pack more computing power into smaller spaces. Companies can then use their existing racks and select the number of GPUs that best suits their needs.\u00a0\nEnterprises can use H200 NVL to accelerate AI and HPC applications, while also improving energy efficiency through reduced power consumption. With a 1.5x memory increase and 1.2x bandwidth increase over NVIDIA H100 NVL, companies can use H200 NVL to fine-tune LLMs within a few hours and deliver up to 1.7x faster inference performance. For HPC workloads, performance is boosted up to 1.3x over H100 NVL and 2.5x over the NVIDIA Ampere architecture generation.\u00a0\nComplementing the raw power of the H200 NVL is NVIDIA NVLink technology. The latest generation of NVLink provides GPU-to-GPU communication 7x faster than fifth-generation PCIe \u2014 delivering higher performance to meet the needs of HPC, large language model inference and fine-tuning.\u00a0\nThe NVIDIA H200 NVL is paired with powerful software tools that enable enterprises to accelerate applications from AI to HPC. It comes with a five-year subscription for NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a cloud-native software platform for the development and deployment of production AI. NVIDIA AI Enterprise includes NVIDIA NIM microservices for the secure, reliable deployment of high-performance AI model inference.\u00a0\nCompanies Tapping Into Power of H200 NVL\nWith H200 NVL, NVIDIA provides enterprises with a full-stack platform to develop and deploy their AI and HPC workloads.\u00a0\nCustomers are seeing significant impact for multiple AI and HPC use cases across industries, such as visual AI agents and chatbots for customer service, trading algorithms for finance, medical imaging for improved anomaly detection in healthcare, pattern recognition for manufacturing, and seismic imaging for federal science organizations.\u00a0\nDropbox is harnessing NVIDIA accelerated computing for its services and infrastructure.\n\u201cDropbox handles large amounts of content, requiring advanced AI and machine learning capabilities,\u201d said Ali Zafar, VP of Infrastructure at Dropbox. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring H200 NVL to continually improve our services and bring more value to our customers.\u201d\nThe University of New Mexico has been using NVIDIA accelerated computing in various research and academic applications.\u00a0\n\u201cAs a public research university, our commitment to AI enables the university to be on the forefront of scientific and technological advancements,\u201d said Prof. Patrick Bridges, director of the UNM Center for Advanced Research Computing. \u201cAs we shift to H200 NVL, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate a variety of applications, including data science initiatives, bioinformatics and genomics research, physics and astronomy simulations, climate modeling and more.\u201d\nH200 NVL Available Across Ecosystem\nDell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of configurations supporting H200 NVL.\u00a0\nAdditionally, H200 NVL will be available in platforms from Aivres, ASRock Rack, ASUS, GIGABYTE, Ingrasys, Inventec, MSI, Pegatron, QCT, Wistron and Wiwynn.\nSome systems are based on the NVIDIA MGX modular architecture, which enables computer makers to quickly and cost-effectively build a vast array of data center infrastructure designs.\nPlatforms with H200 NVL will be available from NVIDIA\u2019s global systems partners beginning in December. To complement availability from leading global partners, NVIDIA is also developing an Enterprise Reference Architecture for H200 NVL systems.\u00a0\nThe reference architecture will incorporate NVIDIA\u2019s expertise and design principles, so partners and customers can design and deploy high-performance AI infrastructure based on H200 NVL at scale. This includes full-stack hardware and software recommendations, with detailed guidance on optimal server, cluster and network configurations.

The open-source BioNeMo Framework offers a collection of accelerated computing tools designed to exponentially scale AI models for biomolecular research, bringing a new level of supercomputing to biopharma.\n\u201cThe convergence of AI, accelerated computing and expanding datasets offers unprecedented opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry, as evidenced by recent Nobel Prize wins in chemistry,\u201d said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. \u201cTo help unravel the complexities of biological systems, we\u2019ve introduced the open-source BioNeMo Framework, which will enable researchers worldwide to accelerate the development of life-saving treatments.\u201d\nPioneering biotech companies, techbio researchers and AI platform companies and organizations are already contributing or will contribute to the open-source framework, including A Alpha Bio; Argonne National Laboratory; Dyno Therapeutics; Genentech, a member of the Roche Group; Ginkgo Bioworks; Relation; VantAI and Weights & Biases. Key research leaders known for advancing computational science also use the BioNeMo Framework to drive innovation.\n\u201cArgonne has contributed billion-parameter biological models that require specialized software to train across high-performance computing environments,\u201d said Arvind Ramanathan, computational science group leader at Argonne National Laboratory. \u201cWith BioNeMo, Argonne and the broader biotech community gain an enterprise-level, open-source solution that enables researchers to easily scale the training of large biological foundation models \u2014 in labs that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have the computational expertise to do so.\u201d\nIntroducing the Next-Generation BioNeMo Platform\r\nThe end-to-end NVIDIA BioNeMo platform is designed to accelerate AI model creation, customization and deployment for drug discovery and molecular design. Seamlessly integrated with accelerated computing infrastructure, it reduces costs, increases scale and speeds up drug discovery workflows to provide fast, reliable insights from biomolecular data.\nIn addition to the BioNeMo Framework, the platform supports NVIDIA NIM\u2122 \u2014 optimized microservices for secure, scalable AI inference \u2014 and NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprints, which are optimized reference designs for wet-lab and computational workflows.\nNVIDIA also announced a new collection of optimized, easy-to-use NIM microservices for BioNeMo. The microservices can be deployed quickly and easily on premises or in any data center or cloud. This offers developers the flexibility to run applications across a diverse range of environments and reduces the time from inference to insights for biological drug discovery research.\nThe newly available NIM microservices support industry-leading models, including:\n\nAlphaFold2 is a deep learning model, developed by Google DeepMind, designed to transform protein structure prediction. Researchers using the AlphaFold2 NIM microservice for BioNeMo achieved a 5x speedup when predicting protein structures in near real time.\nDiffDock 2.0 is based on MIT research and trained on the gold-standard PLINDER dataset. With the DiffDock 2.0 NIM microservice, researchers were able to predict the orientation of a molecule 6.2x faster and 16% more accurately.\nRFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN NIM microservices help speed up the process of designing novel proteins to bind with a target molecule and enable the creation of new protein therapeutics.\n\nBioNeMo now includes new acceleration libraries, including cuEquivariance, that accelerate the mathematical computations essential to DiffDock predictions for chemistry.\nCompanies can use NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference AI workflows, to help developers scale their AI deployments as enterprise-grade production pipelines.\nThe BioNeMo Blueprint for virtual screening provides a customizable, easy-to-follow workflow for using NIM microservices to design small molecules faster, while saving time and costs.\nMore than 200 techbios, large pharma and startup users are already integrating BioNeMo into their computer-aided drug discovery platforms and workflows.\nGlobal system integrators, software providers and cloud service providers such as Accenture, AWS and Deloitte are bringing NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprints to enterprises worldwide.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA\u00a0BioNeMo\u00a0Framework, NVIDIA NIM, and NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprints; third parties using or adopting our products and technologies, the benefits and impact thereof, and the features, performance and availability of their offerings; the open-source BioNeMo Framework enabling researchers worldwide to accelerate the development of life-saving treatments; and pioneering biotech companies,\u00a0techbio\u00a0researchers and AI platform companies and organizations contributing to the open-source framework are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

It runs up to 12x faster than current tokenizers, while NeMo Curator provides video processing curation up to 7x faster than unoptimized pipelines.\nAlso timed with CoRL, NVIDIA presented 23 papers and nine workshops related to robot learning and released training and workflow guides for developers. Further, Hugging Face and NVIDIA announced they\u2019re collaborating to accelerate open-source robotics research with LeRobot, NVIDIA Isaac Lab and NVIDIA Jetson for the developer community.\nAccelerating Robot Development With Isaac Lab\u00a0\nNVIDIA Isaac Lab is an open-source, robot learning framework built on NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing OpenUSD applications for industrial digitalization and physical AI simulation.\nDevelopers can use Isaac Lab to train robot policies at scale. This open-source unified robot learning framework applies to any embodiment \u2014 from humanoids to quadrupeds to collaborative robots \u2014 to handle increasingly complex movements and interactions.\nLeading commercial robot makers, robotics application developers and robotics research entities around the world are adopting Isaac Lab, including 1X, Agility Robotics, The AI Institute, Berkeley Humanoid, Boston Dynamics, Field AI, Fourier, Galbot, Mentee Robotics, Skild AI, Swiss-Mile, Unitree Robotics and XPENG Robotics.\nProject GR00T: Foundations for General-Purpose Humanoid Robots\u00a0\nBuilding advanced humanoids is extremely difficult, demanding multilayer technological and interdisciplinary approaches to make the robots perceive, move and learn skills effectively for human-robot and robot-environment interactions.\nProject GR00T is an initiative to develop accelerated libraries, foundation models and data pipelines to accelerate the global humanoid robot developer ecosystem.\n\nSix new Project GR00T workflows provide humanoid developers with blueprints to realize the most challenging humanoid robot capabilities. They include:\n\nGR00T-Gen for building generative AI-powered, OpenUSD-based 3D environments\nGR00T-Mimic for robot motion and trajectory generation\nGR00T-Dexterity for robot dexterous manipulation\nGR00T-Control for whole-body control\nGR00T-Mobility for robot locomotion and navigation\nGR00T-Perception for multimodal sensing\n\n\u201cHumanoid robots are the next wave of embodied AI,\u201d said Jim Fan, senior research manager of embodied AI at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA research and engineering teams are collaborating across the company and our developer ecosystem to build Project GR00T to help advance the progress and development of global humanoid robot developers.\u201d\nNew Development Tools for World Model Builders\nToday, robot developers are building world models \u2014 AI representations of the world that can predict how objects and environments respond to a robot\u2019s actions. Building these world models is incredibly compute- and data-intensive, with models requiring thousands of hours of real-world, curated image or video data.\nNVIDIA Cosmos tokenizers provide efficient, high-quality encoding and decoding to simplify the development of these world models. They set a new standard of minimal distortion and temporal instability, enabling high-quality video and image reconstructions.\nProviding high-quality compression and up to 12x faster visual reconstruction, the Cosmos tokenizer paves the path for scalable, robust and efficient development of generative applications across a broad spectrum of visual domains.\n1X, a humanoid robot company, has updated the 1X World Model Challenge dataset to use the Cosmos tokenizer.\n\u201cNVIDIA Cosmos tokenizer achieves really high temporal and spatial compression of our data while still retaining visual fidelity,\u201d said Eric Jang, vice president of AI at 1X Technologies. \u201cThis allows us to train world models with long horizon video generation in an even more compute-efficient manner.\u201d\nOther humanoid and general-purpose robot developers, including XPENG Robotics and Hillbot, are developing with the NVIDIA Cosmos tokenizer to manage high-resolution images and videos.\nNeMo Curator now includes a video processing pipeline. This enables robot developers to improve their world-model accuracy by processing large-scale text, image and video data.\nCurating video data poses challenges due to its massive size, requiring scalable pipelines and efficient orchestration for load balancing across GPUs. Additionally, models for filtering, captioning and embedding need optimization to maximize throughput.\nNeMo Curator overcomes these challenges by streamlining data curation with automatic pipeline orchestration, reducing processing time significantly. It supports linear scaling across multi-node, multi-GPU systems, efficiently handling over 100 petabytes of data. This simplifies AI development, reduces costs and accelerates time to market.\nAdvancing the Robot Learning Community at CoRL\nThe nearly two dozen research papers the NVIDIA robotics team released with CoRL cover breakthroughs in integrating vision language models for improved environmental understanding and task execution, temporal robot navigation, developing long-horizon planning strategies for complex multistep tasks and using human demonstrations for skill acquisition.\nGroundbreaking papers for humanoid robot control and synthetic data generation include SkillGen, a system based on synthetic data generation for training robots with minimal human demonstrations, and HOVER, a robot foundation model for controlling humanoid robot locomotion and manipulation.\nNVIDIA researchers will also be participating in nine workshops at the conference. Learn more about the full schedule of events.\nAvailability\nNVIDIA Isaac Lab 1.2 is available now and is open source on GitHub. NVIDIA Cosmos tokenizer is available now on GitHub and Hugging Face. NeMo Curator for video processing will be available at the end of the month.\nThe new NVIDIA Project GR00T workflows are coming soon to help robot companies build humanoid robot capabilities with greater ease. Read more about the workflows on the NVIDIA Technical Blog.\nResearchers and developers learning to use Isaac Lab can now access developer guides and tutorials, including an Isaac Gym to Isaac Lab migration guide.\nDiscover the latest in robot learning and simulation in an upcoming OpenUSD insider livestream on robot simulation and learning on Nov. 13, and attend the NVIDIA Isaac Lab office hours for hands-on support and insights.\nDevelopers can apply to join the NVIDIA Humanoid Robot Developer Program.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | Research | RoboticsTags: Isaac | Jetson | NVIDIA NeMo | Omniverse | Physical AI | Simulation and Design | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The blueprint is a reference workflow that includes NVIDIA acceleration libraries, physics-AI frameworks and interactive physically based rendering to achieve 1,200x faster simulations and real-time visualization.\n\u201cWe built Omniverse so that everything can have a digital twin,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cOmniverse Blueprints are reference pipelines that connect NVIDIA Omniverse with AI technologies, enabling leading CAE software developers to build groundbreaking digital twin workflows that will transform industrial digitalization, from design and manufacturing to operations, for the world\u2019s largest industries.\u201d\nOne of the first applications of the blueprint is computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a critical step to virtually explore, test and refine the designs of cars, airplanes, ships and many other products. Traditional engineering workflows \u2014 from physics simulation to visualization and design optimization \u2014 can take weeks or even months to complete.\nIn an industry first, NVIDIA and Luminary Cloud are demonstrating at SC24 a virtual wind tunnel that allows users to simulate and visualize fluid dynamics at real-time, interactive speeds, even when changing the vehicle model inside the tunnel.\nUnifying Three Pillars of NVIDIA Technology for Developers\r\nBuilding a real-time physics digital twin requires two fundamental capabilities: real-time physics solver performance and real-time visualization of large-scale datasets.\nThe Omniverse Blueprint achieves these by bringing together NVIDIA CUDA-X\u2122 libraries to accelerate the solvers, the NVIDIA Modulus physics-AI framework to train and deploy models to generate flow fields, and NVIDIA Omniverse application programming interfaces for 3D data interoperability and real-time RTX-enabled visualization.\nDevelopers can integrate the blueprint as individual elements or in its entirety into their existing tools.\nEcosystem Uses NVIDIA Blueprint to Advance Simulations\nAnsys is the first to adopt the Omniverse Blueprint, applying it to Ansys Fluent fluid simulation software to enable accelerated CFD simulation.\nAnsys ran Fluent at the Texas Advanced Computing Center on 320 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. A 2.5-billion-cell automotive simulation was completed in just over six hours, which would have taken nearly a month running on 2,048 x86 CPU cores, significantly enhancing the feasibility of overnight high-fidelity CFD analyses and establishing a new industry benchmark.\n\u201cBy integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint with Ansys software, we\u2019re enabling our customers to tackle increasingly complex and detailed simulations more quickly and accurately,\u201d said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys. \u201cOur collaboration is pushing the boundaries of engineering and design across multiple industries.\u201d\nLuminary Cloud is also adopting the blueprint. The company\u2019s new simulation AI model, built on NVIDIA Modulus, learned the relationships between airflow fields and car geometry based on training data generated from its GPU-accelerated CFD solver. The model runs simulations orders of magnitude faster than the solver itself, enabling real-time aerodynamic flow simulation that is visualized using Omniverse APIs.\nAltair, Beyond Math, Cadence, Hexagon, Neural Concept, Siemens, SimScale and Trane Technologies are also exploring adoption of the Omniverse Blueprint into their own applications.\nThe Omniverse Blueprint can be run on all leading cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It is also available on NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud.\nRescale, a cloud-based platform that helps organizations accelerate scientific and engineering breakthroughs, is using the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint to enable organizations to train and deploy custom AI models in just a few clicks.\nThe Rescale platform automates the full application-to-hardware stack and can be run across any cloud service provider. Organizations can generate training data using any simulation solver; prepare, train and deploy the AI models; run inference predictions; and visualize and optimize models.\nAvailability\r\nCompanies interested in learning more about the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for real-time computer-aided engineering digital twins can sign up for early access.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, and performance of NVIDIA\u2019s products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint, NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries, NVIDIA Modulus physics-AI framework, NVIDIA NIM microservice, NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, and NVIDIA DGX Cloud; NVIDIA\u2019s collaborations with third parties and the benefits and impact thereof; third parties using or adopting our products and technologies, the benefits and impact thereof, and the features and performance of their offerings; and Omniverse Blueprints enabling leading CAE software developers to build groundbreaking digital twin workflows that will transform industrial digitalization, from design and manufacturing to operations, for the world\u2019s largest industries are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

It\u2019s what moves me to create music. The idea that I can create entirely new sounds on the fly in the studio is incredible.\u201d\nA Sound Grasp of Audio\n\u201cWe wanted to create a model that understands and generates sound like humans do,\u201d said Rafael Valle, a manager of applied audio research at NVIDIA and one of the dozen-plus people behind Fugatto, as well as an orchestral conductor and composer.\nSupporting numerous audio generation and transformation tasks, Fugatto is the first foundational generative AI model that showcases emergent properties \u2014 capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities \u2014 and the ability to combine free-form instructions.\n\u201cFugatto is our first step toward a future where unsupervised multitask learning in audio synthesis and transformation emerges from data and model scale,\u201d Valle said.\nA Sample Playlist of Use Cases\nFor example, music producers could use Fugatto to quickly prototype or edit an idea for a song, trying out different styles, voices and instruments. They could also add effects and enhance the overall audio quality of an existing track.\n\u201cThe history of music is also a history of technology. The electric guitar gave the world rock and roll. When the sampler showed up, hip-hop was born,\u201d said Zmishlany. \u201cWith AI, we\u2019re writing the next chapter of music. We have a new instrument, a new tool for making music \u2014 and that\u2019s super exciting.\u201d\nAn ad agency could apply Fugatto to quickly target an existing campaign for multiple regions or situations, applying different accents and emotions to voiceovers.\nLanguage learning tools could be personalized to use any voice a speaker chooses. Imagine an online course spoken in the voice of any family member or friend.\nVideo game developers could use the model to modify prerecorded assets in their title to fit the changing action as users play the game. Or, they could create new assets on the fly from text instructions and optional audio inputs.\nMaking a Joyful Noise\n\u201cOne of the model\u2019s capabilities we\u2019re especially proud of is what we call the avocado chair,\u201d said Valle, referring to a novel visual created by a generative AI model for imaging.\nFor instance, Fugatto can make a trumpet bark or a saxophone meow. Whatever users can describe, the model can create.\nWith fine-tuning and small amounts of singing data, researchers found it could handle tasks it was not pretrained on, like generating a high-quality singing voice from a text prompt.\nUsers Get Artistic Controls\nSeveral capabilities add to Fugatto\u2019s novelty.\nDuring inference, the model uses a technique called ComposableART to combine instructions that were only seen separately during training. For example, a combination of prompts could ask for text spoken with a sad feeling in a French accent.\nThe model\u2019s ability to interpolate between instructions gives users fine-grained control over text instructions, in this case the heaviness of the accent or the degree of sorrow.\n\u201cI wanted to let users combine attributes in a subjective or artistic way, selecting how much emphasis they put on each one,\u201d said Rohan Badlani, an AI researcher who designed these aspects of the model.\n\u201cIn my tests, the results were often surprising and made me feel a little bit like an artist, even though I\u2019m a computer scientist,\u201d said Badlani, who holds a master\u2019s degree in computer science with a focus on AI from Stanford.\nThe model also generates sounds that change over time, a feature he calls temporal interpolation. It can, for instance, create the sounds of a rainstorm moving through an area with crescendos of thunder that slowly fade into the distance. It also gives users fine-grained control over how the soundscape evolves.\nPlus, unlike most models, which can only recreate the training data they\u2019ve been exposed to, Fugatto allows users to create soundscapes it\u2019s never seen before, such as a thunderstorm easing into a dawn with the sound of birds singing.\nA Look Under the Hood\nFugatto is a foundational generative transformer model that builds on the team\u2019s prior work in areas such as speech modeling, audio vocoding and audio understanding.\nThe full version uses 2.5 billion parameters and was trained on a bank of NVIDIA DGX systems packing 32 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nFugatto was made by a diverse group of people from around the world, including India, Brazil, China, Jordan and South Korea. Their collaboration made Fugatto\u2019s multi-accent and multilingual capabilities stronger.\nOne of the hardest parts of the effort was generating a blended dataset that contains millions of audio samples used for training. The team employed a multifaceted strategy to generate data and instructions that considerably expanded the range of tasks the model could perform, while achieving more accurate performance and enabling new tasks without requiring additional data.\nThey also scrutinized existing datasets to reveal new relationships among the data. The overall work spanned more than a year.\nValle remembers two moments when the team knew it was on to something. \u201cThe first time it generated music from a prompt, it blew our minds,\u201d he said.\nLater, the team demoed Fugatto responding to a prompt to create electronic music with dogs barking in time to the beat.\n\u201cWhen the group broke up with laughter, it really warmed my heart.\u201d\nHear what Fugatto can do:\n\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | ResearchTags: Artificial Intelligence \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This new service, which supports AI training and edge AI inference, positions SoftBank to become the AI grid for Japan, facilitating new business opportunities for the creation, distribution and use of AI services across the country\u2019s industries, consumers and enterprises.\n\u201cJapan has a long history of pioneering technological innovations with global impact,\u201d said Huang. \u201cWith SoftBank\u2019s significant investment in NVIDIA\u2019s full-stack AI, Omniverse and 5G AI-RAN platforms, Japan is leaping into the AI industrial revolution to become a global leader, driving a new era of growth across the telecommunications, transportation, robotics and healthcare industries in ways that will greatly benefit humankind in the age of AI.\u201d\n\u201cCountries and regions worldwide are accelerating the adoption of AI for social and economic growth, and society is undergoing significant transformation,\u201d said Junichi Miyakawa, president and CEO of SoftBank. \u201cThrough our long collaboration with NVIDIA, SoftBank is leading this transformation from the forefront. With our extremely powerful AI infrastructure and our new, distributed AI-RAN solution \u2018AITRAS\u2019 that reinvents 5G networks for AI, we will accelerate innovation across the country and throughout the world.\u201d\nSoftBank First to Receive Blackwell, Plans for Grace Blackwell\r\nSoftBank is slated to receive the world\u2019s first NVIDIA DGX\u2122 B200 systems, which will serve as the building blocks for its new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122 supercomputer.\nSoftBank plans to use its Blackwell-powered DGX SuperPOD for its own generative AI development and AI-related business, as well as that of universities, research institutions and businesses throughout Japan.\nUpon completion, SoftBank\u2019s DGX SuperPOD is expected to be Japan\u2019s most performant to date. Featuring NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking, it is also ideal for the development of large language models.\nIn addition to its DGX SuperPOD, SoftBank plans to build another NVIDIA-accelerated supercomputer to run extremely compute-intensive workloads. Initial plans for the supercomputer are based on an NVIDIA Grace Blackwell platform design featuring NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale systems that combine NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with power-efficient Arm-based NVIDIA Grace\u2122 CPUs.\nAI-RAN Reaches New Milestone\r\nWorking closely with NVIDIA, SoftBank has achieved a technology milestone \u2014 the development of a new kind of telecommunications network that can run AI and 5G workloads at the same time, known by the industry as artificial intelligence radio access network, or AI-RAN.\nThis new breed of infrastructure has broad ecosystem support from the telecom industry, as it offers operators the ability to transform their base stations from cost centers into AI revenue-producing assets.\nThrough an outdoor trial conducted in the Kanagawa prefecture, SoftBank demonstrated that its NVIDIA-accelerated AI-RAN solution has achieved carrier-grade 5G performance and was able to do so while using the network\u2019s excess capacity to run AI inference workloads concurrently.\nTraditional telco networks are designed to handle peak loads and, on average, have used only one-third of that capacity. With the common computing capability provided by AI-RAN, it is expected that telcos now have the opportunity to monetize the remaining two-thirds capacity for AI inference services.\nNVIDIA and SoftBank estimate that telco operators can earn roughly $5 in AI inference revenue from every $1 of capex it invests in new AI-RAN infrastructure.(1) Taking into account its opex and capex costs, SoftBank estimates it can achieve a return of up to 219% for every AI-RAN server it adds to its infrastructure.(2)\nReal-World Inference Runs on AI-RAN\r\nFor the trial, SoftBank used NVIDIA AI Enterprise to build real-world AI inference applications, including autonomous vehicle remote support, robotics control and multimodal retrieval-automated generation at the edge. All inference workloads were able to run optimally on SoftBank\u2019s AI-RAN network.\nSoftBank\u2019s fully software-defined 5G radio stack is optimized for NVIDIA\u2019s AI computing platform and includes L1 software enhanced by SoftBank based on NVIDIA Aerial\u2122 CUDA\u00ae-accelerated RAN libraries. SoftBank plans to incorporate NVIDIA Aerial RAN Computer-1 systems, which it estimates can use 40% less power than traditional 5G network infrastructure,(3) into its solution moving forward.\nNVIDIA and SoftBank partners that contributed to the trial of SoftBank\u2019s AI-RAN solution include Fujitsu and Red Hat.\nMatching Supply With Demand\r\nBecause an AI-RAN solution needs to spin compute up or down dynamically based on demand and supply without compromising carrier-grade performance in real time, SoftBank aims to build an ecosystem that connects the demand and supply of AI technology by using NVIDIA AI Enterprise serverless application programming interfaces and its in-house developed orchestrator. This enables SoftBank to dispatch external AI inferencing jobs to an AI-RAN server when computing resources are available to deliver localized, low-latency, secure inferencing services.\n\u201cShifting from single-purpose to multi-purpose AI-RAN networks can mean 5x the revenue for every dollar of capex invested,\u201d said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at NVIDIA. \u201cSoftBank\u2019s live field trial marks a huge step toward AI-RAN commercialization with the validation of technology feasibility, performance and economics.\u201d\n\u201cSoftBank\u2019s \u2018AITRAS\u2019 is the first AI-RAN solution developed through a five-year collaboration with NVIDIA. It integrates and coordinates AI and RAN workloads through the SoftBank-developed orchestrator, enhancing communication efficiency by running dense cells on a single NVIDIA-accelerated GPU server,\u201d said Ryuji Wakikawa, vice president and head of the Research Institute of Advanced Technology at SoftBank. \u201cWe are confident this AI-driven innovation, AITRAS, will pave the way for new business models in telecommunications, serving as a crucial factor in the transformation of mobile operators.\u201d\nLearn more about NVIDIA solutions for AI-RAN.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\u00a0(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Results do not guarantee actual revenue at time of implementation.\r\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on estimates by SoftBank.\r\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on estimates by NVIDIA and SoftBank.

Day Passes give access to 24 continuous hours of powerful cloud gaming.\nIn addition, seven new games are available this week, joining the over 2,000 games in the GeForce NOW library.\nTime for a Glow Up\nThe Performance membership keeps all the same great gaming benefits and now provides members with an enhanced streaming experience at no additional cost.\nSay hello to the Performance membership.\nPerformance members can stream at up to 1440p \u2014 an increase from the previous 1080p resolution \u2014 and experience games in immersive, ultrawide resolutions.

This ample limit comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe. Members can check out how much time they\u2019ve spent in the cloud through their account portal (see screenshot example above).\nUp to 15 hours of unused playtime will automatically roll over to the next month for members, and additional hours can be purchased at $2.99 for 15 additional hours of Performance, or $5.99 for 15 additional Ultimate hours.\nLoyal Member Benefit\nTo thank the GFN community for joining the cloud gaming revolution, GeForce NOW is offering active paid members as of Dec. 31, 2024, the ability to continue with unlimited playtime for a full year until January 2026.\nNew members can lock in this feature by signing up for GeForce NOW before Dec. 31, 2024.

Nvidia stock NVDA briefly shot up to global dominance on Monday when it overtook Apple as the world\u2019s biggest company. The chip giant\u2019s shares added 0.5% on the day but flexed an intraday peak of more than 0.7%, which was enough to catapult the company to a valuation of $3.376 trillion. Apple, on the other hand, got left behind (feeling inadequate?) with a market cap of $3.366 trillion. By the session\u2019s end, the order had swapped again with Nvidia moving to second place.  Fresh momentum was infused in Nvidia\u2019s upside swing thanks to its inclusion in the 30-stock iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average index, replacing Intel, which has been a mainstay component for over 25 years. The reasoning behind the swap, S&P Dow Jones Indices said, was to \u201censure a more representative exposure to the semiconductors industry.\u201d Still, analysts believe this event won\u2019t provide lots of traction in the long term.  What will, however, keep the shares well-bid and growing is Nvidia\u2019s ability to stay on top of all things AI. Nvidia has largely cornered the most important market in tech right now \u2014 artificial intelligence is getting jammed into virtually every tech company that wants to stay relevant. And that\u2019s driving Nvidia\u2019s revenues to sky high places. Shares of the Jensen Huang-led chip king are up 182% year-to-date.

Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool   November 25, 2024 6 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. The AI chip superstar delivered another round of smashing results, easily beating estimates in its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 20. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?\u00a0\u00a0Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter.\u00a0Sign Up For Free \u00bb  Revenue jumped 94% in the quarter to $35.1 billion, which topped the consensus at $33.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) more than doubled from $0.40 to $0.81, ahead of estimates at $0.75. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. It's the most valuable company in the world, but it's only natural to wonder if it will be the first to make it to the $4 trillion milestone. That seems likely, and it could happen sooner than you think.   Image source: Getty Images.   1. Supply is still the biggest constraint Nvidia has been reporting eye-popping revenue growth since the launch of ChatGPT. In fact, this was the first time in six quarters that the company failed to deliver triple-digit sales growth, though you're not going to hear any complaints about a 94% jump on the top line. Even as Nvidia's growth naturally moderates, the amount of revenue it's adding each quarter is still expanding, showing that the business is still accelerating. But what's even more impressive is that its third-quarter revenue increase doesn't reflect the underlying demand for its product. That continues to outstrip supply, which is constrained by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's ability to produce its chips.  On the third-quarter earnings call, chief financial officer Colette Kress described demand for the new Blackwell platform as \"staggering\" and demand for the legacy Hopper platform as \"exceptional.\" Speaking about the Blackwell platform, she added, \"We are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us,\" and she forecast that Blackwell demand would exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026. It's impossible to quantify the company's demand, but its quarterly revenue should be seen as a baseline for its potential revenue rather than an accurate reflection of demand for its products. 2. It has beaten back the bears Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia and has been for some time. Even as the company slipped on the earnings report, over a dozen analysts raised their price targets on the stock.   Story Continues But there are bearish arguments against the stock. First, some investors believe that competition will eventually erode Nvidia's advantage. However, AMD and Intel have already launched their competing AI accelerators, and so far, they do not seem like a threat to Nvidia.AMD stock fell after its third-quarter earnings report due to disappointing guidance, and it said it would lay off 4% of its workforce. Intel, meanwhile, faces a wide range of challenges after announcing a massive restructuring in August.Nvidia's data center revenue run rate has now reached $120 billion, and with built-in competitive advantages like its CUDA software library, catching it may be impossible.Another bearish view cites concerns about an \"AI bubble\" forming as Wall Street is anxious to see more revenue from Nvidia's customers, including cloud hyperscalers.But the chipmaker's report should push back on that narrative as well because the company is experiencing demand from a wide range of companies, which are using AI for purposes well beyond large language models.Asked about scaling limitations on large language models, CEO Jensen Huang responded that scaling up is continuing and is going beyond its conventional focus in training to post-training and inference.While a risk of a bubble forming always exists in any high-growth asset class, Nvidia's results indicate there's no sign of a pullback so far, nor do there seem to be underlying structural concerns.3. The stock is cheaper than it looksAfter the third-quarter report, Nvidia now trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 55, which is roughly double that of the S&P 500, but the business is growing so fast that trailing metrics don't really tell the story.It reported adjusted EPS of $0.81 in the third quarter, and extrapolating that over four quarters would give you a P/E of 44, which seems to be a more accurate reflection of its existing valuation.Even forward estimates don't seem to be the best indicator, since Nvidia regularly tops them. Currently, the consensus calls for earnings of $4.31 per share in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026. Based on that forecast, the stock has a forward P/E of just 34.Over the last four quarters, however, Nvidia has beat consensus EPS by an average of 9%. If it continues that pattern, the company will deliver EPS of at least $4.70 next year, giving it a forward P/E of 31, nearly on par with the broad market.Those ratios don't even factor in the chipmaker's soaring growth as its EPS is still doubling on a year-over-year basis.$4 trillion is within sightTo reach a market cap of $4 trillion, the stock would only have to gain 14% from here, which seems very possible by the end of the year.Nvidia just delivered another flawless round of results, and it remains the dominant force in the next major computing platform. The company will get to a $4 trillion market cap at some point.

SMCI Stock Crash Explained\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) is among the top performers in 2024, trailing only AI-related stock Vistra Corp (NASDAQ: VST). The company has delivered impressive returns, driven by growing demand for AI technologies across key industries. With its market capitalization now approaching about 12% of the U.S. GDP, Nvidia has solidified its position as a dominant player in the tech sector.At press time, NVDA shares are trading at $136.84 \u2014 after shedding 3.08% on the weekly chart on account of broadly disappointing earnings and guidance from the tech sector. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the stock is up 184.10%.Naturally, concerns about valuations have started to surface. Beyond the broader anxieties about a potential AI bubble, there is a more specific factor that could hinder Nvidia\u2019s momentum.On November 20, the chipmaker is set to release its Q4 2024 earnings report \u2014 and by then, one of its largest customers could be delisted and under investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ). This potential development could significantly impact Nvidia\u2019s performance and stock price. SMCI Stock Crash ExplainedSuper Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) was one of the standout performers of 2024 until recently. From the start of the year through August 27, SMCI had surged by an impressive 89.61%.However, the stock's momentum came to a sudden halt when Hindenburg Research, a well-known short-selling activist firm, published a damaging report alleging widespread accounting fraud. The report also revealed that Hindenburg had taken a short position on SMCI stock.The very next day, Super Micro announced that it would delay the filing of its annual 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This news triggered a sharp 30% drop in SMCI's share price, as investors reacted to the potential implications for the company\u2019s financial health.In the aftermath of this revelation, Super Micro Computer stock traded in a range from $40 to $45, occasionally reaching as high as $47. On October 30, it became public that six days prior, the venture\u2019s auditor, Ernst & Young (EY) had resigned. What followed was another 30% decrease in share price.Interestingly enough, one savvy trader appears to have potentially had insider knowledge that this would happen \u2014 having placed an options trade that netted him roughly 3,000% returns.At press time, on November 1, SMCI shares are trading at $26.88 \u2014 having lost 5.92% in value on the daily chart \u2014 finally turning the company\u2019s year-to-date (YTD) returns negative at 5.80%.How Super Micro Computer\u2019s Potential Delisting Could Impact Nvidia StockWhile Nvidia (NVDA) does not disclose the names of its largest customers in the Q-10 filings it submits to the SEC, it does report the percentage of its revenue generated by these clients.The filing reveals a concerning concentration of revenue, with 46% of Nvidia\u2019s total earnings tied to just four customers. If one of these key customers, such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI), were to face delisting or financial difficulties, it could have a significant impact on Nvidia\u2019s revenue and, by extension, its stock performance.The fallout from Super Micro Computer\u2019s (SMCI) troubles is likely to impact Nvidia\u2019s stock price following its earnings report, as a key revenue source may experience reduced demand or even halt orders entirely.This development also comes at a time when many investors remain skeptical about the sustainability of increased AI spending, questioning whether the industry's long-term potential justifies short-term profit sacrifices. The prospect of one of Nvidia\u2019s largest customers potentially being involved in fraud could further erode investor confidence. It may even act as the tipping point for AI-weary investors, triggering a broader selloff in Nvidia stock. When considering shares, indices, forex (foreign exchange) and commodities for trading and price predictions, remember that trading CFDs involves a significant degree of risk and could result in capital loss.

Investors and speculators are gearing up for Nvidia Corp.\u2018s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings report on Wednesday, an event that\u2019s expected to send ripples, if not tidal waves, across the U.S. stock market.  If the options market is right, Nvidia's results could spark moves in the S&P 500 index \u2013 as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) \u2013 larger than those typically triggered by key economic data like the employment and inflation reports.  Nvidia's dominance in the AI-driven technology trade has turned its earnings into a barometer for overall market sentiment, and its influence on the stock market is unparalleled. Don\u2019t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share  Over the past year, Nvidia accounted for 20% of the S&P 500's total returns and Bank of America's derivatives analyst Gonzalo Asis didn't mince words: \u201cIt remains the most dominant stock in the market... expected to drive nearly 25% of the S&P 500\u2019s EPS growth in 3Q.\u201d In essence, whether Nvidia beats or misses expectations, the ripple effects will likely extend far beyond its ticker. S&P 500 Implied Move Is Higher Than Inflation Or Jobs Data The options market implies a potential 1.05% move in the S&P 500\u2014higher than what traders expect from next month's Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, Consumer Price Index (CPI) print, and in line with the Federal Reserve\u2019s December meeting. \u201cOptions are assigning more broad-market risk around NVDA earnings than around next month\u2019s NFP and CPI days, and as much as the Dec FOMC,\u201d the analyst noted. For Nvidia shares themselves, the implied one-day move is even more eye-popping: 12.5%. \u201cWe remain cautious of fragility risks in single names around earnings, but NVDA hedges themselves are not particularly cheap relative to how much the stock has reacted to results in the last two years,\u201d Assis wrote.  The analyst also warned that the recent easing of post-election euphoria and heightened single-stock fragility can be reasons for traders to hedge against potential market turbulence if Nvidia disappoints. Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.   Story Continues A Strategy For Hedging The Nasdaq ImpactFor traders seeking to hedge the broader market risks tied to Nvidia\u2019s performance, Bank of America recommended an option strategy using put spreads on the Nasdaq-100 ETF, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). Specifically, the QQQ 22Nov 490-480 put spreads are priced at $2 and could offer a 5x payout if the Nasdaq-100 falls by roughly 3.3% this week.Despite the potential need for hedges, the bank also noted that hedging NVDA earnings directly is not cheap, considering how significantly the stock has reacted to its last few earnings reports.Historical Nvidia Earnings DataData from Benzinga Pro shows that over the last 12 quarters, Nvidia has exceeded earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations 10 times and missed revenue expectations only once.On average, Nvidia shares moved 5.3% in the single trading day following its earnings release.The largest 1-day gain followed its first quarter 2024 earnings, when the stock surged 24.4%, while the worst reaction occurred after fourth quarter 2024 results, with a decline of 7.6%.Here's a snapshot of the company's recent earnings performance:Data: Benzinga ProRead Next:Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

CFO CommentaryCommentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA\u2019s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast InformationNVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025. Non-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Personally, I\u2019m bearish on Intel and TSMC, but I\u2019m bullish on AMD, expecting it to experience continued market share gains and share price appreciation over the medium term. While AMD is unlikely to reach the heights we\u2019ve seen at Nvidia, the stock could see further supportive trends over the next three to five years. Meanwhile, I\u2019m put off TSMC by its geographical concentration risk and Intel represents too big a risk after years of technological underinvestment. AMD: The Next Big Winner? Let\u2019s start with AMD. The stock has surged over the past two years, but nowhere near as much as Nvidia. However, it\u2019s arguably Nvidia\u2019s biggest competitor in terms of technological capabilities in the fast-growing data center and AI segment. The company is also making significant strides in developing its \u201cfull-stack\u201d offering \u2014 software to complement the hardware \u2014 which could substantially enhance its competitiveness in the AI market.  AMD\u2019s recent acquisition of ZT Systems marks an important step in this full-stack direction, representing its first major foray into comprehensive AI software solutions. This strategic move is expected to improve system-level integration, reduce time-to-market for AI solutions, and expand AMD\u2019s reach into the hyperscale market. And there\u2019s plenty of market to grow into. That\u2019s because AMD currently holds less than 5% of the GPU market share for AI and around 11% of the overall AI market share (including CPUs). AMD is positioning itself for growth and claims that its EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators offer superior performance for AI inferencing workloads, particularly in data centers. AMD\u2019s Valuation The problem with AMD is that some fairly considerable growth expectations are already priced in. The stock is currently trading at 44.4x forward earnings and has a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.08. So, while the company is expected to grow earnings by around 40% annually over the medium term, there\u2019s clearly some downside risk because of the sizeable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Still, I\u2019m bullish on AMD. I\u2019m expecting earnings to surge over the coming years as hyperscalers seek Nvidia alternatives as part of a broader effort to de-risk and expand the supply chain. I understand that the stock is pricey, but I really don\u2019t see these AI-related tailwinds slowing down for AMD.   Story Continues On TipRanks, AMD comes in as a Strong Buy based on 26 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by Wall Street analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average AMD stock price target\u00a0is $187.04, implying a more than 34.3% upside potential.  See more AMD analyst ratingsIntel: It\u2019s Losing OutIntel has largely missed out on the initial AI boom that has propelled competitors like Nvidia and AMD to new heights in 2024. Nvidia has dominated the market for AI accelerators, and AMD has made significant inroads, but Intel has struggled to gain traction with its AI offerings.However, while Intel\u2019s chip business may have been falling behind for almost a decade now, Intel may be poised for a recovery in 2025 as it ramps up its AI strategy. The company has been investing heavily in developing new AI-focused products and technologies, as Intel\u2019s upcoming Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake processors are slated for release in late 2024 and early 2025. Both are designed to better support AI workloads on PCs and servers.The company is targeting over 100 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2025, which could help it regain market share. Additionally, Intel\u2019s partnership with Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) AWS to build custom AI Fabric Chips and Xeon 6 processors represents a major opportunity in the data center and cloud AI market. It\u2019s a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar deal and could significantly boost Intel\u2019s AI credentials.Intel Might Not Surge BackHowever, Intel\u2019s foundry services present both challenges and opportunities. The foundries are currently being consolidated into an independent subsidiary and may play a crucial role in the company\u2019s AI strategy or could be sold \u2014 although a buyer might be hard to find.By attracting more third-party customers for chip manufacturing, Intel could position itself as a key player in the AI hardware ecosystem. However, many of Intel\u2019s production nodes use the company\u2019s proprietary electronic design automation (EDA) tools and flows and are designed for Intel CPUs.\u00a0That may be something that needs addressing if Intel is to service the wider market more regularly.On TipRanks, INTC comes in as a Hold based on one Buys, 22 Holds, and seven Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average INTC stock price target\u00a0is $24.43, implying about 2% downside potential.\u00a0Personally, and as someone who broadly avoids trying to catch falling knives, I\u2019m bearish on Intel. Of course, a recovery may be in the cards, but it\u2019s not a risk I\u2019d wish to take as an investor.See more INTC analyst ratingsTSMC: A Winner with Concentration RiskInterestingly, TSMC has said it won\u2019t be looking to buy Intel\u2019s foundry business despite being one of the few companies in the world with the financial capacity to do so. I say \u2018interestingly\u2019 because Intel\u2019s foundries are located all around the world, including in places like Ireland and Israel. Meanwhile, TSMC\u2019s foundries are located predominantly in Taiwan \u2014 an island nation claimed by Beijing \u2014 creating a degree of concentration risk.Of course, there are a host of reasons why TSMC wouldn\u2019t buy Intel\u2019s foundries, including the fact that Intel\u2019s nodes will be different from those of the Taiwanese company \u2014 as noted above. Moreover, TSMC has its own expansion strategy, which includes notable projects in the United States, Japan, and Europe.More generally, the company is already well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for advanced chips in AI, 5G, and high-performance computing applications. TSMC\u2019s continued investment in cutting-edge process technologies should help maintain its competitive edge while benefiting from other companies\u2019 success as a major supplier to firms like Nvidia.TSMC\u2019s Discount Is Not EnoughHowever, geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan pose a risk to TSMC\u2019s operations, resulting in the stock typically trading at a discount to peers. TSMC currently trades at 27.2x forward earnings, representing a 6.9% premium to the information technology sector as a whole. However, the PEG ratio indicates that, on face value, this stock is undervalued with a ratio of 0.8.On TipRanks, TSM comes in as a Strong Buy based on five Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The\u00a0average TSM stock price target\u00a0is $205, implying about 9.8% upside potential.  See more TSM analyst ratingsPersonally, given the existential and geopolitical risks facing Taiwan and TSMC\u2019s operations base, I\u2019m turning bearish on the stock. It\u2019s gone too high for the geopolitical risk in my opinion. I realize that this is a change of tune for me, but at nearly $200 a share, it\u2019s not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.Disclosure  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion.  Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. Nvidia's stock price seesawed Thursday morning, popping to an intraday record before moseying around the flat line, as investors weighed the forecast.

Market Open.     Advanced Chart    \u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d Huang said in a statement. \u201cDemand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell \u2014 in full production \u2014 are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference.\" The chip giant's Data Center business, which makes up the vast majority of its revenue, brought in $30.8 billion in the quarter, beating out analysts' expectations of $29 billion and jumping 112% versus the $14.5 billion the segment made in Q3 last year.  Nvidia's gaming revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up from $2.8 billion the division brought in last year. Analysts were looking for $3 billion. Nvidia's stock has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond.

Nvidia also appeared to assuage concerns about potential slowdowns in the availability of its next-generation Blackwell chip, with CFO Colette Kress saying that the AI GPU will begin shipping in the current quarter and ramp into the year ahead. \"Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026,\" she added. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? Shares of Nvidia were up 192% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given that Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world.   Story Continues In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.The vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers.Join me for a Reddit AMA tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET on the r/stockmarket subreddit to chat live about all things Nvidia.

Adria Cimino   November 26, 2024 5 min read        2   In This Article:  NVDA         Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has roared higher in recent years \u2014 and it's continued with that momentum this year, as it's heading for a gain of more than 185%. There's good reason for this top performance. The company has become the leader in a key product to serve a market that may be worth $1 trillion by the end of the decade. I'm talking about chips for the artificial intelligence (AI) market.  But Nvidia hasn't stopped with chips. Instead, the company has built an entire portfolio of AI products and services \u2014 from networking elements to an enterprise software system. Nvidia has become the \"go to\" company for AI and counts the world's top tech companies as its customers. All of this has led to triple-digit revenue growth for its data center business and high profitability \u2014 with gross margin greater than 70% \u2014 on those sales. Start Your Mornings Smarter!

If you haven't yet gotten in on this story, though, you may be wondering about when to make the move. After all, if you buy before an upcoming catalyst, you could benefit from an immediate boost. And that next catalyst might be on Dec. 3. Should you buy Nvidia before then? Let's find out.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia's 80% market share Before looking at what's coming up on that day next week, let's first consider the Nvidia story so far. As mentioned, the company's chips \u2014 graphics processing units (GPUs) \u2014 now dominate the AI market, holding 80% share. The GPU has the ability to process many tasks at once, and Nvidia has pledged to update its GPUs on an annual basis. This commitment to innovation should help the company maintain its leadership position. Nvidia's GPUs are the fastest around, making them the ideal engine for AI projects. And since tech companies are racing to win in the field of AI \u2014 aiming to produce the best AI platforms or to use AI to develop game-changing products \u2014 they need the very best chip to get the job done. In recent times, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said he and Tesla leader Elon Musk even \"begged\" Nvidia for more GPUs.  Why would Ellison and Musk have to beg? Because so many players have ordered Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU, demand has surpassed supply. So, even though Nvidia products and services are widely available on every public cloud, it isn't exactly easy for customers to get their hands on the very latest GPU right away. All of this is reason to be optimistic about Nvidia's sales as this AI boom continues.   Story Continues Now you're probably wondering: What's happening on Dec. 3? Nvidia will make a presentation at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference. The event will feature presentations from various companies in the field, with a focus on how technology is transforming the world today \u2014 and what's to come.The upcoming Blackwell launchIt's important to remember that Nvidia just reported earnings last week, offering us third-quarter figures along with a fresh update on business in the current quarter. Investors and the company itself are heavily focused on the upcoming release of the Blackwell architecture and chip. The launch is getting rolling, with Nvidia already sending out some products to big customers \u2014 it delivered 13,000 chip samples in the third quarter \u2014 but the production ramp will happen throughout this current quarter.Since Nvidia's earnings report was so recent, I wouldn't expect any major new announcement at the UBS conference. That said, with the production ramp picking up speed in the coming weeks, at any point the company may offer a new detail that could add to visibility on revenue. So, it's important to keep an eye on any Nvidia presentation during the quarter.Now, let's get back to our question: Should you buy the stock before Dec. 3? If Nvidia gives us new, positive updates or even reiterates that Blackwell demand is soaring, the stock could pop \u2014 offering holders a short-term gain.But, if you plan on holding onto the stock for the long term \u2014 the best way to truly win in investing \u2014 this won't impact your returns by much at all. So, though Nvidia is a great AI stock to buy, you don't have to rush into it before the UBS conference.

Its datacentre business, which provides graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI servers, contributed $30.8bn during the quarter, representing the bulk of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.\nDiscussing the company and next-generation chips, he added: \u201cDemand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell \u2013 in full production \u2013 are incredible as foundation model makers scale pre-training, post-training and inference.\n\u201cAI is transforming every industry, company and country,\u201d said Huang. \u201cEnterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionise workflows. Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI, and countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure.\u201d\nAccording to a transcript of the earnings call posted on Seeking Alpha, chief financial officer Colette Kress said sales of Nvidia H200 GPUs increased significantly to \u201cdouble-digit billions\u201d. She described this as \u201cthe fastest product ramp in our company\u2019s history\u201d, adding that cloud service providers accounted for approximately half of Nvidia\u2019s datacentre sales.\nDuring the earnings call, Huang discussed methods to improve the accuracy and scaling of large language models. \u201cAI foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale.\u201d\n\n\nRead more GPU stories\n\nAMD pushes GPU advantage with HPC top spot: AMD\u2019s El Capitan is the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer and is being used in nuclear weapons safety.\nRed Hat acquires tech to lower the cost of machine learning: The acquisition of Neural Magic by Red Hat is being positioned as a way to democratise machine learning and reduce the need for GPUs.\n\n\n\nHuang said that post-training scaling, which began with reinforcement learning human feedback, is now using AI feedback and synthetic generated data.\nAnother approach is test time scaling. \u201cThe longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces, and it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect, and so on and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like us doing the thinking in our head before we answer a question.\u201d\nHuang said increasing the performance of GPUs reduces the cost of training and AI inferencing. \u201cWe\u2019re reducing the cost of AI so that it can be much more accessible,\u201d he added.\nLooking at factors that could curb the company\u2019s phenomenal growth trajectory, Huang said: \u201cMost datacentres are now a hundred megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we\u2019re planning on gigawatt datacentres.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how large the datacentres are, the power is limited,\u201d he said, adding that what matters to Nvidia datacentre customers is how they can deliver the highest performance per watt, which translates directly into the highest revenues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more on Artificial intelligence, automation and robotics\n\n\n\nNvidia CEO claims reasoning models will boost GPU demand\n\n\n\n\nBy: Cliff\u00a0Saran\n\n\n\n\nNvidia reports strong Q4, prepares for new AI GPUs\n\n\n\n\nBy: Antone\u00a0Gonsalves\n\n\n\n\nGenAI demand fuels record sales of datacentre hardware and software in 2024\n\n\n\n\nBy: Caroline\u00a0Donnelly\n\n\n\n\nNvidia drives forward accelerated computing advantage\n\n\n\n\nBy: Cliff\u00a0Saran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\nFormula 1 accelerates decision response with team content delivery\n\n\nEXA Infrastructure, Ultranet build fibre route across key Italian cities\n\n\nIR35: Research highlights rise in outside IR35 engagements among contractors\n\n\nView All News\n\n\n\n\n\tDownload CW Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nIn The Current Issue:\n\nHow banks are navigating the AI landscape\nInside Grab\u2019s platform strategy\nIndia\u2019s fintechs find fortune in underserved segments\n\n\n\t\t\tDownload Current Issue\n\n\n\n\nLatest Blog Posts\n\n\nWhat on earth is data lineage?\n\u2013 Data Matters\n\n\nThe importance of taking time to get IT right\n\u2013 Cliff Saran's Enterprise blog\n\n\nView All Blogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\n\nNvidia drives forward accelerated computing advantage\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\nNvidia sees massive datacentre compute growth, says ...\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\nAccelerated datacentre computing propels record ...\n\u2013 ComputerWeekly.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest TechTarget resources\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCIO\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecurity\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNetworking\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Center\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tData Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch CIO\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computer vs. supercomputer: Key differences\nQuantum computers could someday outperform supercomputers by orders of magnitude.

This will help overcome the current limitations of quantum computing hardware, which can only run a certain number of quantum operations before computations must cease, due to what researchers call \u201cnoise.\u201d\n\u201cThe development of commercially useful quantum computers is only possible if we can scale up quantum hardware while keeping noise in check,\u201d said Guifre Vidal, research scientist from Google Quantum AI. \u201cUsing NVIDIA accelerated computing, we\u2019re exploring the noise implications of increasingly larger quantum chip designs.\u201d\nUnderstanding noise in quantum hardware designs requires complex dynamical simulations capable of fully capturing how qubits within a quantum processor interact with their environment.\nThese simulations have traditionally been prohibitively computationally expensive to pursue. Using the CUDA-Q platform, however, Google can employ 1,024\u00a0NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs\u00a0at the NVIDIA Eos supercomputer to perform one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest dynamical simulation of quantum devices \u2014 at a fraction of the cost.\n\u201cAI supercomputing power will be helpful to quantum computing\u2019s success,\u201d said Tim Costa, director of quantum and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cGoogle\u2019s use of the CUDA-Q platform demonstrates the central role GPU-accelerated simulations have in advancing quantum computing to help solve real-world problems.\u201d\nWith CUDA-Q and H100 GPUs, Google can perform fully comprehensive, realistic simulations of devices containing 40 qubits \u2014 the largest-performed simulations of this kind. The simulation techniques provided by CUDA-Q mean noisy simulations that would have taken a week can now run in minutes.\nThe software powering these accelerated dynamic simulations will be publicly available in the CUDA-Q platform, allowing quantum hardware engineers to rapidly scale their system designs.\n\n\n\n\nCUDA-QGoogle Quantum AINVIDIA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Swayne \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a several-decades long background in journalism and communications, Matt Swayne has worked as a science communicator for an R1 university for more than 12 years, specializing in translating high tech and deep tech for the general audience.

The next largest company is Microsoft, which was worth $3.12 trillion on Wednesday.\n\nIn the two years since ChatGPT's debut, shares of Nvidia, which supplies the tech sector with AI-enabling GPU chips, have added nearly $3.2 trillion to their market valuation. The stock has soared about 800%.Wall Street believes the gains can continue, with some analysts expecting the stock to soon top a $4 trillion valuation.Bank of America analysts raised their Nvidia price target to $190 last week, citing strong upside and a \"generational opportunity\" as it grows its lead in the AI space.\n\nAnother recent milestone for Nvidia is its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with the company set to replace Intel on Friday.Nvidia will report third-quarter earnings results after the market close on November 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple\n\n\nMover\n\n\nMarkets\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, one of Nvidia's biggest fans on Wall Street, said the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter earnings reported after the bell Wednesday were \"flawless\" and \u201cshould be framed and hung in the Louvre\u201d in a note to investors Thursday.   Ives, with his typical flair, also frequently refers to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d and the company's latest Blackwell AI chip as the \u201cLeBron\u201d of semiconductors. \"We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025,\" Ives wrote elsewhere in his report.  Nvidia\u2019s financial results for the quarter ended Oct. 27 topped expectations across the board. And while other analysts didn\u2019t go so far as to recommend Nvidia\u2019s print as worthy of a fine art exhibition, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan, DA Davidson, and Bernstein each raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.75 -2.78 (-2.33%)  As of 3:11:25 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    \u201cNVIDIA is well within its means to extend growth into next year given hyperscaler commentary around additional investments in AI compute and the company's ability to deliver even with production setbacks,\u201d wrote DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria in his own note to investors Thursday. Luria is relatively bearish on Nvidia and has cautioned about risks to the company\u2019s growth, including the potential of an AI bubble and Nvidia\u2019s high concentration of revenue among relatively few Big Tech customers. But following Nvidia\u2019s third quarter results, Luria raised his price target on the stock to $135 from $90, though he maintained his Neutral rating.  JPMorgan's Harlan Sur reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia shares and raised his price target to $170 from $155, noting continued strong demand for Nvidia's Hopper chips even as tech firms race to buy its latest Blackwell lineup. William Stein of Truist Securities, who also maintains a Buy rating on Nvidia stock, wrote in a note late Wednesday, \u201cNVDA remains *the* AI company owing to its culture of innovation, ecosystem of incumbency, and massive investment in software, pre-trained models, and services.\u201d   Quelling fears Despite the beat, shares of Nvidia were off about 1% on Thursday and lagging the broader market. The stock was up by half a percentage point at the market close.   Story Continues Analysts attributed the slip in shares to the company's in-line guidance for the current quarter. Stein, for his part, countered any negative sentiment on the stock, writing, \u201cNVDA's increased confidence in the Blackwell ramp should overwhelm the drag on the stock from a Q4 revenue guidance number that was just \u2018good\u2019 rather than \u2018great\u2019.\u201dNvidia earlier this year delayed production of its latest Blackwell AI chips from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, given design flaws that the company said have since been resolved. A report from the Information this week regarding overheating issues with Nvidia\u2019s latest servers, which each include 72 Blackwell chips, renewed fears of delays and sent the stock down.But Nvidia dispelled those anxieties, at least in the eyes of analysts.In a note titled \u201cFake News?\u201d, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis wrote, \u201dConsistent with our own sources, NVDA reiterated Blackwell production in full steam as it now anticipates JanQ shipments ahead of prior expectations.\u201d  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang before a baseball game between the San Francisco Giants and the Arizona Diamondbacks in San Francisco, Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESSNvidia shares have come under pressure at times during recent months, with fears AI spending from Big Tech firms could hit a wall. Uncertainty surrounding how Trump 2.0 trade policies could affect the company, which sells specialized chips to China under the current trade restrictions, has also entered the picture. Sales to China made up 14% of Nvidia's data center revenue during the company\u2019s fiscal year ended Jan. 28, 2024.\"Chip War\" author Christopher Miller told Yahoo Finance that semiconductors shouldn\u2019t take too big a hit from tariffs directly, though they may come under pressure if tariffs on electronics assembled in China such as PCs and phones \u2014 which use the chips \u2014 cause demand for those products to wane.\u201cThe change in administration is not going to make a big difference [for chipmakers],\u201d Miller said.Nvidia also has an advantage in the fact that it\u2019s expanding into other markets beyond compute products for AI software developers, Voltron Data's field chief technology officer Rodrigo Aramburu told Yahoo Finance. \u201cNVIDIA is really well positioned,\" Aramburu said. \"[It's] in more places than AI.\"Truist Securities\u2019 Stein said this week he expects Nvidia to release a consumer CPU, which is used for \"traditional\" computing, next year, \"opening up significant additional [total addressable market].\"Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company said at the time that the new funds would help it take its first products to market, develop advanced infrastructure and accelerate its research and development.\nAnd in September, the company introduced its Colossus 100k H100 training cluster. Writing about it on X, Musk called it \u201cthe most powerful AI training system in the world. Moreover, it will double in size to 200k (50k H200x) in a few months.\u201d\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS wrote last week about a MIT spinoff Liquid AI\u2019s creation of systems that can match current capabilities while using fewer neurons, a development that could potentially reduce the massive computing costs that have kept many businesses from investing in AI.\nLiquid AI\u2019s \u201cliquid neural networks\u201d require only dozens of neurons to guide drones and vehicles \u2014 rather than the millions required for conventional AI systems. The technology could forge a path to reducing the computing power and energy costs that have kept some businesses from fully embracing AI technology.\n\u201cIt could democratize AI adoption by making AI technologies more accessible and affordable to businesses across various industries,\u201d Jesal Gadhia, head of engineering at AI company Thoughtful, told PYMNTS.\u00a0\n\u201cThis affordability would enable even smaller companies to implement AI solutions, leading to widespread innovation, increased efficiency, and reduced energy consumption throughout different sectors. This mirrors the transition we experienced with computing: initially, only select organizations could build and operate mainframes, but now computing is ubiquitous \u2014 from our watches to our cars.\u201d\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n                        Recommended                    \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Financial Leaders: How AI Transforms Compliance and Risk Management                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Klarna Files for IPO, Promises Investors \u2018New Era of Finance\u2019                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Gen Z Accounts for Largest Increase in Paycheck-to-Paycheck Consumers                                \n\n\n\n\n \n                                    Levelpath Integrates Procurement Automation Capabilities With Coupa\u2019s Spend Management Platform                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More In:                    AI, AI Investment, Andreessen Horowitz, artificial intelligence, Elon Musk, GenAI, generative AI, News, NVIDIA, PYMNTS News, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, What's Hot, xAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Trending News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Exclusive: Citi Ventures Partner on Emerging AI Trends in FinTech            \n\n\n\n\n                Apple Brings Tap to Pay to 9 New European Countries            \n\n\n\n\n                Bakkt Suffers Major Set Back as Bank Partners Drop Platform            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Big Story    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why the EV Dream May Be Crashing in America            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n        Featured News    \n\n\n\n\n\n                Why Account Validation Changes When Banks Say Yes            \n\n\n\n\n                Study Finds Cash Flow Crisis Deepening for Small Businesses Amid Tariffs and Consumer Pullback            \n\n\n\n\n                90% of Healthcare C-Suite Sees Positive Return From GenAI            \n\n\n\n\n                AI\u2019s Next Job Is as Your Collaborative \u2018Digital Chief of Staff\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n                Washington Weekly: CFPB\u2019s Future and the Impact of CDFI Cuts on Credit Unions            \n\n\n\n\n                Retail Sales Show Dining Out Declines and eCommerce Gains Ground as Consumers Pull Back            \n\n\n\n\n                3 Ways Embedded Finance Solutions Are Remaking B2B Procurement            \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPYMNTS Today\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency\n\n\n\n\n\nB2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital Transformation\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLoading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with PYMNTS\n\nWe\u2019re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.\nLearn More\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

As Bloomberg notes, the chipmaker has experienced an astronomical 850% growth since the tail end of 2022.\nNvidia was valued at $3.43 trillion at the close of market, topping Apple\u2019s $3.38 trillion. This isn\u2019t the first time the two have swapped places; Nvidia also pushed past Apple in June, though it only held the top spot for a day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple recently launched its own small model generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence. Nvidia, on the other hand, remains a foundational piece of the world\u2019s top large language models \u2014 for now. At the end of October, Reuters reported that ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been working with Broadcom on its own proprietary systems.\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAI, Apple, Hardware, nvidia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\nSee More\n\n\nSubscribe for the industry\u2019s biggest tech news\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch Daily News\nEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch AI\nTechCrunch's AI experts cover the latest news in the fast-moving field.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch Space\nEvery Monday, gets you up to speed on the latest advances in aerospace.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups Weekly\nStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNo newsletters selected.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n\n\nLatest in AI\n\nSee More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAI\n\n\nNvidia announces new GPUs at GTC 2025, including Vera Rubin\n\n\n\nKyle Wiggers\n\n\n\t30 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAI\n\n\nStability AI\u2019s new AI model turns photos into 3D scenes\n\n\n\nKyle Wiggers\n\n\n\t2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAI\n\n\nHow to watch Nvidia GTC 2025, including CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s keynote\n\n\n\nKyle Wiggers\n\n\n\t3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nInstagram\nyouTube\nMastodon\nThreads\nBluesky\n\n\n\nTechCrunchStaffContact UsAdvertiseCrunchboard JobsSite Map\nTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyRSS Terms of UsePrivacy Placeholder 1Privacy Placeholder 2Privacy Placeholder 3Privacy Placeholder 4Code of ConductAbout Our Ads\nGTC 2025Google Buys WizClaude Voice ModeSkype ShutdownMeta LlamaTech LayoffsChatGPT\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Yahoo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

These vulnerabilities have a high-risk severity and can range from 7 to over 8 on the severity scale, which NVIDIA wants its users to fix through a driver update.\nRelated Story NVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\nOther products that are affected by these vulnerabilities are NVS and Tesla, which can be fixed via the latest drivers as shared by NVIDIA. The flaws exist in the previous drivers which affect both NVIDIA GPU Display Driver and NVIDIA VGPU Software. As per the information shared by the company, this can allow hackers to execute malicious code on users' systems, and steal and tamper with personal data.\nFor all the vulnerabilities on the GPU Display Driver, NVIDIA states:\nNVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow a privileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.\nThe severity can be 7.8-8.2, which is pretty high for users to take lightly. For\u00a0 VGPU Software, the risk can be either 7.1 or 7.8 based on the two vulnerabilities found. NVIDIA recommends updating to driver 566.03/553.24/538.95 for Windows OS users, who currently own a GeForce, RTX, Quadro, and NVS GPU. For NVIDIA's Tesla series products, it's recommended to update to the\u00a0553.24/538.95\u00a0driver to ensure secure operation.\nLinux users are also advised to update to the latest drivers. For GeForce GPUs, driver version\u00a0565.57.01/550.127.05/535.216.01\u00a0will be the latest update. For RTX, Quadro, and NVS GPUs, users should update to 565.57.01/550.127.05/535.216.01\u00a0and for Tesla GPUs, driver versions\u00a0550.127.05/535.216.01\u00a0will do the job.\nTo update to the latest driver, users can also manually search for the drivers on the NVIDIA website by selecting their GPU from the options. In some cases, computer vendors themselves may provide the latest GPU display drivers, which contain the latest security updates.\nNews Sources: NVIDIA, PC World\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GTC Outlook From A Top Analyst: GB300 With HBM Capacity Surge, TDP Of 1.4kW, Shipments Commence In Q3 2025, Additional Details On Rubin And CPO Tech\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Announces RTX Neural Shading Support Going Live in April\u2019s DirectX Agility Preview\n\nAlessio Palumbo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA DLSS 4 Now In Over 100 Games With More Titles Coming Soon, Neural Shading Support For DirectX Arriving Next Month\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiper Sandler Sees 10x Increase In NVIDIA\u2019s GPU Capacity And A 35x Decrease In Model Inference Costs As Seeds For The Upcoming \u201cAI Wave 2\u201d\n\nRohail Saleem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nValve Rumored To Launch SteamOS For Desktop PCs Soon; Is Time For A Bloatware-Free OS Near?\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nM3 Ultra Runs DeepSeek R1 With 671 Billion Parameters Using 448GB Of Unified Memory, Delivering High Bandwidth Performance At Under 200W Power Consumption, With No Need For A Multi-GPU Setup\n\n\n\n31\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s RTX 50 Series Shortage Extends To System Integrators As Well, Claiming That They Are Forced To Buy At Scalper Prices\n\n\n\n29\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Shows Off Trio of Upcoming Action Games Running at Up to 500 FPS\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s \u201cHigh-End\u201d AI Servers Worth $390 Million Apparently End Up in Malaysia, Revealing Another US Export Restriction Loophole\n\n\n\n23\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nHere\u2019s How You Can Run AMD\u2019s FSR 4 On Basically Any Title, Including Cyberpunk 2077, Simply Through A Modding Tool\n\n\n\n2092\nComments\n\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1525\nComments\n\n\n\n12V-2\u00d76 Power Connector Cooks At Over 150\u00b0C With A \u201cWater-Cooled\u201d NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090\n\n\n\n1360\nComments\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Releases Another Hotfix Driver to Resolve Black Screen Issues, Marking the Firm\u2019s Fifth Attempt to Address The Problem\n\n\n\n1300\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1285\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

With repetitive tasks automated, teams can focus on the creative aspects of their jobs.\nDeveloping Controllable Generative AI for Content Production\nThe new Omniverse Blueprint introduces a robust framework for integrating generative AI into 3D workflows to enable precise and controlled asset creation.\nExample images created using the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for 3D conditioning for precise visual generative AI.\nKey highlights of the blueprint include:\n\nModel conditioning to ensure that the AI-generated visuals adhere to specific brand requirements like colors and logos.\nMultimodal approach that combines 3D and 2D techniques to offer developers complete control over final visual outputs while ensuring the product\u2019s digital twin remains accurate.\nKey components such as an on-brand hero asset, a simple and untextured 3D scene, and a customizable application built with the Omniverse Kit App Template.\nOpenUSD integration to enhance development of 3D visuals with precise visual generative AI.\nIntegration of NVIDIA NIM, such as the Edify 360 NIM, Edify 3D NIM, USD Code NIM and USD Search NIM microservices, allows the blueprint to be extensible and customizable. The microservices are available to preview on build.nvidia.com.\n\nHow Developers Are Building AI-Enabled Content Pipelines\nKatana Studio developed a content creation tool with OpenUSD called COATcreate that empowers marketing teams to rapidly produce 3D content for automotive advertising. By using 3D data prepared by creative experts and vetted by product specialists in OpenUSD, even users with limited artistic experience can quickly create customized, high-fidelity, on-brand content for any region or use case without adding to production costs.\n\nGlobal marketing leader WPP has built a generative AI content engine for brand advertising with OpenUSD. The Omniverse Blueprint for precise visual generative AI helped facilitate the integration of controllable generative AI in its content creation tools. Leading global brands like The Coca-Cola Company are already beginning to adopt tools from WPP to accelerate iteration on its creative campaigns at scale.\nWatch the replay of a recent livestream with WPP for more on its generative AI- and OpenUSD-enabled workflow:\n\nThe NVIDIA creative team developed a reference workflow called CineBuilder on Omniverse that allows companies to use text prompts to generate ads personalized to consumers based on region, weather, time of day, lifestyle and aesthetic preferences.\nDevelopers at independent software vendors and production services agencies are building content creation solutions infused with controllable generative AI and built on OpenUSD. Accenture Song, Collective World, Grip, Monks and WPP are among those adopting Omniverse Blueprints to accelerate development.\nRead the tech blog on developing product configurators with OpenUSD and get started developing solutions using the DENZA N7 3D configurator and CineBuilder reference workflow.\nGet Plugged Into the World of OpenUSD\nVarious resources are available to help developers get started building AI-enabled product configuration solutions:\n\nOmniverse Blueprint: 3D Conditioning for Precise Visual Generative AI\nReference Architecture: 3D Conditioning for Precise Visual Generative AI\nReference Architecture: Generative AI Workflow for Content Creation\nReference Architecture: Product Configurator\nEnd-to-End Configurator Example Guide\nDLI Course: Building a 3D Product Configurator With OpenUSD\nLivestream: OpenUSD for Marketing and Advertising\n\nFor more on optimizing OpenUSD workflows, explore the new self-paced Learn OpenUSD training curriculum that includes free Deep Learning Institute courses for 3D practitioners and developers.

As they are ready to develop data centers depending on the technology, these problems might affect big cloud service consumers as Meta Platforms (META, Financials), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL, Financials), Microsoft (MSFT, Financials).  Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.  The overheating issue arises from chips placed in server racks meant to support up to 72 units. To solve these problems, Nvidia apparently has requested vendors to repeatedly rebuild the racks. Citing Nvidia staff, suppliers, and consumers, the research revealed that overheating issues still exist. A spokesperson for Nvidia stated, \"Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected.\" Originally revealed in March, the Blackwell chips were supposed to arrive in the second quarter. Delays, however, pushed delayed delivery, therefore affecting client deployment schedules. The chips combine two silicon components into one unit meant to run 30 times quicker than past versions in jobs like chatbot answer creation. With its products essential to key technological platforms, this story tracks Nvidia's attempts to establish its leadership in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The overheating problem, however, might cause questions over whether the rising needs of data-intensive AI projects can be satisfied. Nvidia has not revealed which vendors help to remedy the design problems or when the overheating concerns could be fixed. The delays could influence the larger AI infrastructure plans of important customers. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

The CEO of the most valuable company in the world didn\u2019t rest his laurels on a 94% year-over-year revenue growth number for Q3 and faced up to several questions about the future of his company as well as the general prospects for AIs growth for the rest of the decade.\n\u201cMany AI services are running 24/7, just like any factory,\u201d Huang told the earnings call audience. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see this new type of system come online. And I call it [the company\u2019s data centers] an AI factory because that\u2019s really close to what it is. It\u2019s unlike a data center of the past. \n\u201cAnd these fundamental trends are really just beginning. We expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.\u201d\nHuang and CFO Colette Kress clearly feel that the company\u2019s best days are ahead of it, even as analysts question whether or not it can keep up the pace in several areas: large language model (LLM) development, AI usage scale and the torrid revenue growth it has achieved over the past two years. \nTheir reasons for optimism ranged from consumer adoption rates to the coming explosion of enterprise and industrial AI and the long list of companies that rely on Nvidia data centers and chips (whose manufacturing is outsourced) for their own applications. \nBy way of background, an AI data center is a specialized facility designed to handle the heavy computational demands of AI workloads, essentially providing the infrastructure needed to train and deploy complex machine learning models and algorithms by processing massive amounts of data using high-performance servers, specialized hardware accelerators, and advanced networking capabilities, all optimized for AI operations. In simpler terms, it\u2019s a data center specifically built to power AI applications at scale.\nIf there was a theme on the call and in the earnings materials, it was that laundry list of companies from Alphabet to Meta to Microsoft to Oracle to Volvo that are hooked into Nvidia. But when that list wasn\u2019t running, Huang and Kress faced some tough questions from analysts, ranging from scaling for LLM development to a potential controversy about reported overheating issues for the companies seven-chip Blackwell set of GPUs that it is banking its next few years on. For perspective, the company\u2019s Q3 earnings were achieved without shipping any newly designed chips. Blackwell is the new addition, and demand, according to Kress, is \u201cstaggering.\u201d\nDespite some concerns about a potential slowdown in the scaling of LLMs, Huang maintained that there is still ample opportunity for growth. He emphasized that the scaling of foundation models is \u201cintact and continuing,\u201d citing ongoing advancements in post-training scaling and inference-time scaling. \nPost-training scaling, which initially involved reinforcement learning with human feedback, has evolved to incorporate AI feedback and synthetic data generation. Meanwhile, inference-time scaling, demonstrated by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-01, allows for improved answer quality with increased processing time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHuang expressed optimism about the continued growth of the AI market, driven by the ongoing modernization of data centers and the emergence of generative AI applications. He described the shift from traditional coding to machine learning as a fundamental change that will require companies to upgrade their infrastructure to support AI workloads.\u00a0\nHuang also highlighted the emergence of generative AI, which he likened to the advent of the iPhone, as a completely new capability that will create new market segments and opportunities. He cited examples such as OpenAI, Runway and Harvey, which provide basic intelligence, digital artist intelligence, and legal intelligence, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture is designed to meet the demands of this evolving AI landscape. The company has developed seven custom chips for the Blackwell system, which can be configured for air-cooled or liquid-cooled data centers and support various MVlink and CPU options. \nHuang acknowledged the engineering challenges involved in integrating these systems into diverse data center architectures but remained confident in Nvidia\u2019s ability to execute.

Moore13 Nov 20244 min readSamuel K. Moore is IEEE Spectrum\u2019s semiconductor editor.Nvidia posted benchmark results for its Blackwell architecture chips.\n        Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n    \n\tNvidia, Oracle, Google, Dell and 13 other companies reported how long it takes their computers to train the key neural networks in use today. Among those results were the first glimpse of \n\tNvidia\u2019s next generation GPU, the B200, and Google\u2019s upcoming accelerator, called Trillium. The B200 posted a doubling of performance on some tests versus today\u2019s workhorse Nvidia chip, the H100. And Trillium delivered nearly a four-fold boost over the chip Google tested in 2023.\n\n\tThe benchmark tests, called MLPerf v4.1, consist of six tasks: recommendation, the pre-training of the \n\tlarge language models (LLM) GPT-3 and BERT-large, the fine tuning of the Llama 2 70B large language model, object detection, graph node classification, and image generation.\n\n\tTraining \n\tGPT-3 is such a mammoth task that it\u2019d be impractical to do the whole thing just to deliver a benchmark. Instead, the test is to train it to a point that experts have determined means it is likely to reach the goal if you kept going. For Llama 2 70B, the goal is not to train the LLM from scratch, but to take an already trained model and fine-tune it so it\u2019s specialized in a particular expertise\u2014in this case,government documents. Graph node classification is a type of machine learning used in fraud detection and drug discovery.\n\n\tAs what\u2019s important in AI has evolved, mostly toward using \n\tgenerative AI, the set of tests has changed. This latest version of MLPerf marks a complete changeover in what\u2019s being tested since the benchmark effort began. \u201cAt this point all of the original benchmarks have been phased out,\u201d says David Kanter, who leads the benchmark effort at MLCommons. In the previous round it was taking mere seconds to perform some of the benchmarks.\nPerformance of the best machine learning systems on various benchmarks has outpaced what would be expected if gains were solely from Moore\u2019s Law [blue line]. Solid line represent current benchmarks. Dashed lines represent benchmarks that have now been retired, because they are no longer industrially relevant.MLCommons\n\tAccording to MLPerf\u2019s calculations, AI training on the new suite of benchmarks is improving at about twice the rate one would expect from \n\tMoore\u2019s Law. As the years have gone on, results have plateaued more quickly than they did at the start of MLPerf\u2019s reign. Kanter attributes this mostly to the fact that companies have figured out how to do the benchmark tests on very large systems. Over time, Nvidia, Google, and others have developed software and network technology that allows for near linear scaling\u2014doubling the processors cuts training time roughly in half.\nhttps://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20196...\u201d width=\u201d100%\u201d alt=\u201dscatter visualization\u201d />\n\tFirst Nvidia Blackwell training results\n\n\tThis round marked the first training tests for Nvidia\u2019s next GPU architecture, called Blackwell. For the GPT-3 training and LLM fine-tuning, the Blackwell (B200) roughly doubled the performance of the H100 on a per-GPU basis. The gains were a little less robust but still substantial for recommender systems and image generation\u201464 percent and 62 percent, respectively.\n\n\tThe \n\tBlackwell architecture, embodied in the Nvidia B200 GPU, continues an ongoing trend toward using less and less precise numbers to speed up AI. For certain parts of transformer neural networks such as ChatGPT, Llama2, and Stable Diffusion, the Nvidia H100 and H200 use 8-bit floating point numbers. The B200 brings that down to just 4 bits.\nGoogle debuts 6th gen hardware\n\n\tGoogle showed the first results for its 6\n\tth generation of TPU, called Trillium\u2014which it unveiled only last month\u2014and a second round of results for its 5th generation variant, the Cloud TPU v5p. In the 2023 edition, the search giant entered a different variant of the 5th generation TPU, v5e, designed more for efficiency than performance. Versus the latter, Trillium delivers as much as a 3.8-fold performance boost on the GPT-3 training task.\n\n\tBut versus everyone\u2019s arch-rival Nvidia, things weren\u2019t as rosy. A system made up of 6,144 TPU v5ps reached the GPT-3 training checkpoint in 11.77 minutes, placing a distant second to an 11,616-Nvidia H100 system, which accomplished the task in about 3.44 minutes. That top TPU system was only about 25 seconds faster than an H100 computer half its size.\n\n\t A Dell Technologies computer fine-tuned the Llama 2 70B large language model using about 75 cents worth of electricity.\n\n\tIn the closest head-to-head comparison between v5p and Trillium, with each system made up of 2048 TPUs, the upcoming Trillium shaved a solid 2 minutes off of the GPT-3 training time, nearly an 8 percent improvement on v5p\u2019s 29.6 minutes. Another difference between the Trillium and v5p entries is that Trillium is paired with AMD Epyc CPUs instead of the v5p\u2019s Intel Xeons.\n\n\tGoogle also trained the image generator, Stable Diffusion, with the Cloud TPU v5p. At 2.6 billion parameters, Stable Diffusion is a light enough lift that MLPerf contestants are asked to train it to convergence instead of just to a checkpoint, as with GPT-3. A 1024 TPU system ranked second, finishing the job in 2 minutes 26 seconds, about a minute behind the same size system made up of Nvidia H100s.\nTraining power is still opaque\n\n\tThe steep energy cost of training neural networks has long been a source of concern. MLPerf is only beginning to measure this. Dell Technologies was the sole entrant in the energy category, with an eight-server system containing 64 Nvidia H100 GPUs and 16 Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs. The only measurement made was in the LLM fine-tuning task (Llama2 70B). The system consumed 16.4 megajoules during its 5-minute run, for an average power of 5.4 kilowatts. That means about 75 cents of electricity at the average cost in the United States.\n\n\tWhile it doesn\u2019t say much on its own, the result does potentially provide a ballpark for the power consumption of similar systems. Oracle, for example, reported a close performance result\u20144 minutes 45 seconds\u2014using the same number and types of CPUs and GPUs.\nFrom Your Site ArticlesPhotonic Chips Curb AI Training\u2019s Energy Appetite \u203aGoogle, Intel, Nvidia Battle in Generative AI Training \u203aRelated Articles Around the WebAI Training Series for Government Employees | GSA - IT ... \u203aWhat is the best AI course? -Are there any AI courses anyone would ... \u203amlperftraininglarge language modelsllmsnvidiagoogle{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}Samuel K.

The news comes ahead of the AI chipmaker's earnings report, which is slated for release after the market close on Wednesday. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.69 -2.83 (-2.37%)  As of 3:11:33 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    It's not the first time issues have been reported with the company's Blackwell products. In August, the Information reported that the leading AI chipmaker was dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves. Nvidia confirmed fears that Blackwell production would be delayed in its earnings report in late August, stating that production of the chips would ramp up in the December quarter rather than its previously stated goal to ramp during the September period. The company has not publicly confirmed any design flaws or overheating issues.  Nvidia told Yahoo Finance about its latest AI servers: \"The engineering iterations are normal and expected.\" Nvidia's so-called GB200 NVL72 server system uses 72 Blackwell chips and 36 of its latest Grace CPUs. Nvidia said the servers are \"the most advanced computers ever created.\" Those Blackwell chips are set to bring in \"several billion dollars\" in sales in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Customers looking to use the Blackwell server system include Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Elon Musk's xAI, according to the Information. Despite reported issues, Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell noted in a post on X Monday, following the Information's report, that Dell is already shipping an unspecified number of Nvidia's Blackwell servers as part of its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge System. Nvidia shares closed Monday down 1.3% to $140.15. As Yahoo Finance\u2019s Dan Howley noted last week, even a stellar report and outlook from the company Wednesday could send its stock down further. Nvidia topped expectations across the board in its most recent quarterly report, for example, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results in late August. Investor excitement over AI spending has also stoked fears Big Tech\u2019s AI spending will ease \u2014 or sharply decline \u2014 punching AI chip companies in the gut.

Story Continues Nvidia shares closed Friday down 3.3%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell 3.4%.Still, Nvidia shares are up roughly 186% from last year. The chipmaker's monumental rise has pushed it past Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, and Nvidia recently replaced Intel on the Dow.This post has been updated to include a comment from Nvidia.

(JHVEPhoto via Shutterstock) \nShareNVIDIA, the world\u2019s most valuable company, sells computer graphics processing chips designed primarily for use in video games, which it sells to manufacturers of game devices. As it happens, NVIDIA\u2019s chips also are useful for mining cryptocurrency, and in 2017 many crypto miners started to buy NVIDIA chips for that purpose. As that use increased, NVIDIA\u2019s chip sales increased. But in 2018, when the price of bitcoin went through a period of sharp decline, reducing the incentive for crypto mining, NVIDIA\u2019s sales declined.\nShareholders responded by filing the proposed class action here, alleging that NVIDIA executives (including CEO Jensen Huang) made false and misleading statements about the extent to which use in crypto mining was propping up NVIDIA\u2019s chip sales. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allowed the action to proceed, and the Supreme Court agreed to review the matter.\nAt issue in the case is the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, a statute adopted in 1995 to stem securities class actions. Among other things, it establishes a high bar for crafting a successful complaint in such a case. If the case alleges a false or misleading statement, it must not only specify the reasons why each statement is believed to be misleading but also \u201cstate with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d Moreover, the complaint also must \u201cstate with particularity facts\u201d that \u201cgiv[e] rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d That \u201cstrong inference\u201d standard is notably higher than the normal standard for a complaint.\nUnder that statute, the shareholders have a hard time showing that Huang spoke falsely when he made statements downplaying the share of NVIDIA chip sales attributable to crypto mining. The shareholders do not have any documents or statements that directly show any reason to think Huang knew what share of sales were made to crypto miners. Rather, they rely on an expert report that estimated the number of crypto-mining processors built during the relevant time, the number of chips that would have been required, and the share of those chips likely to have been sold by NVIDIA. Because the numbers produced by those estimates were inconsistent with Huang\u2019s public statements, the shareholders allege that his statements were false \u2013 indeed that he must have known they were false.\nNVIDIA ridicules this as a potential theory of the case. The company argues that when the theory of \u201cscienter\u201d (the securities law standard of intent \u2013 a Latin term that means something like \u201cwith knowledge\u201d) is that internal company documents contradict public statements, the PSLRA\u2019s requirements of particularity mean that the plaintiff has to allege the contents of those internal documents. So in this case, because the shareholders have not made any such allegations \u2013 they allege nothing at all about any documents Huang might have seen \u2013 they have failed to satisfy their burden.\nFor similar reasons, NVIDIA contends that the shareholders have not done enough to allege that any of Huang\u2019s statements are false. The complaint offers no direct allegations at all about NVIDIA chip sales or the share made to crypto miners; rather, it offers only the generalized estimations of its expert witness based on the size of the crypto market and NVIDIA\u2019s likely share of it. That kind of \u201cgeneric market research,\u201d NVIDIA argues, cannot make out a case of falsity \u201cwith particularity.\u201d\nIn the Supreme Court, the shareholders back away from exclusive reliance on the expert report. Instead, they point to a variety of evidence suggesting that various employees at NVIDIA tracked the rise of crypto mining and that NVIDIA executives were paying attention to that information. Because existing Supreme Court cases about the PSLRA call for a \u201cholistic inquiry\u201d that assesses the information in context, they argue that the justices should reject the \u201cbright line\u201d rule the shareholders see in NVIDIA\u2019s argument, which would require plaintiffs to produce the \u201csmoking gun\u201d internal document when they file their complaint.\nFor its part, NVIDIA responds forcefully that \u2013 contrary to what the shareholders allege in the Supreme Court \u2013 the lower court decision validates the fraud allegations as resting entirely on the failure of Huang to make statements about crypto mining sales that match the findings of the plaintiff\u2019s expert.\nAs with last week\u2019s argument in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, the shareholders here surely will face some skeptical questioning from justices who will think that the complaint in this case is precisely the kind of thing that the PSLRA was designed to squelch. When they say that the rule NVIDIA proposes makes this kind of case basically impossible \u2013 because of the difficulty in obtaining confidential and compromising corporate documents to support a complaint \u2013 those justices are as likely as not to agree, and respond that the PSLRA was designed for exactly that result.\n\n\n\n\nPosted in Merits Cases\n\n\nCases: NVIDIA Corp. v.

(Katie Barlow) \nShareThe justices closed the November session on Wednesday with \u00a0NVIDIA Corp v. E. Ohman J:or Fonder AB, a case arising out of the use of NVIDIA chips by crypto miners. The legal problem presented for the justices is whether the complaint \u2013 which alleges that NVIDIA misled investors by downplaying the sale of its chips for crypto mining rather than gaming \u2013 was sufficiently particular to get over the relatively high pleading standard required for such cases.\nInvestors say the company did not disclose the extent to which sales to crypto-miners put their shares at risk. NVIDIA argues that the shareholders don\u2019t have the hard evidence required for such a case \u2013 specifically, internal documents showing executives knew and withheld information. \nAppearing on behalf of NVIDIA, Neal Katyal argued that the court of appeals was too lax in letting the case go forward, but he had to spend most of his time fencing off questions about why such a fact-specific dispute warranted the court\u2019s attention. Justice Sonia Sotomayor in particular burned through a large portion of Katyal\u2019s time pressing the idea that he is just asking for \u201cerror correction,\u201d a task the justices typically regard as beneath them. It was not a great sign for him that the references to error correction kept surfacing from almost all the questioners during his argument: he got the same line from justices spanning \u201cboth sides of the aisle,\u201d if you will: Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett, and Neil Gorsuch.\nAbout the only substantive discussion Katyal had on the merits was with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who pretty clearly thought that he was asking for far too much. In her words, Katyal was insisting that \u201cplaintiffs \u2026 actually have the evidence in order to plead their case,\u201d while she opined that the standards in fact don\u2019t \u201crequire that they have the documents,\u201d and indeed couldn\u2019t \u201cunderstand how they could have the documents when discovery hasn\u2019t occurred yet.\u201d\nTo be sure, it was not all bad for Katyal. Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly observed that Congress clearly intended in the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act to limit this type of lawsuit. Because in Roberts\u2019 view Congress thought the law did \u201ca good bit more than simply keep out frivolous lawsuits,\u201d Roberts seemed to believe that the justices should put some content in the pleading standards that NVIDIA is challenging.\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh echoed Roberts\u2019 concern, as he worried openly about the ease with which the lower court\u2019s decision would permit shareholders, \u201cany time a stock price falls,\u201d to \u201cget past a motion to dismiss\u201d by simply providing a vague expert report.\nThe shareholders in this case relied on an expert report that looked at the number of of crypto-mining processors built during the relevant time to estimate the likely share of chip sales sold by NVIDIA. But Deepak Gupta, representing the investors, told the justices that the group had presented a variety of other types of evidence. \u00a0\nLate in Katyal\u2019s argument, Roberts interrupted him to ask about his repeated statements that the complaint approved in this case \u201ceats itself.\u201d Roberts commented that he found \u201cthe analogy \u2026 very vivid,\u201d but he confessed that he\u2019d \u201cnever heard\u201d the phrase before and wondered \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d After Katyal labored at some length to explain that he intended only to suggest that the complaint was internally inconsistent, Roberts responded that he remained \u201cnot sure how that\u2019s \u2018eating itself,\u2019 but I\u2019ll take your word [for it].\u201d\nIt\u2019s a little puzzling for so many justices to spend argument time asking an advocate why they\u2019re hearing his case \u2013 four of the people sitting on the bench doubtless voted to hear it, and if they don\u2019t regret that decision then it\u2019s pretty likely the justices will proceed to decide the case.

We\u2019ve very good at it, but there\u2019s still a lot of engineering that happens at this point,\u201d Huang added.\nHuang pointed out that Dell Technologies announced on Sunday that it had started shipping its GB200 NVL72 server racks to customers, including up-and-coming GPU cloud service provider CoreWeave. He also mentioned Blackwell systems that are being stood up by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\n\u201cBut as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to shift this quarter is greater than our previous estimates.\u201d\nAddressing a question about Nvidia\u2019s ability to execute on its data center road map, which moved to an annual release cadence for GPUs and other chips last year, Huang remained steadfast in his commitment to the accelerated production plan.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on an annual roadmap, and we\u2019re expecting to continue to execute on that annual roadmap. And by doing so, we increase the performance of our platform. But it\u2019s also really important to realize that when we\u2019re able to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training, we\u2019re reducing the cost of inference, and we\u2019re reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible,\u201d he said.\nPartner Sounds Off On Nvidia Growth, Investor Reaction\nAfter Nvidia released its third-quarter earnings release, investors reacted by sending the company\u2019s stock price down by more than 1 percent in after-hours trading.\nWhile the company beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations on revenue by nearly $2 billion and exceeded the average analyst estimate for earnings per share by 6 cents, its fourth-quarter revenue estimate was only slightly higher than what Wall Street had been anticipating.\nAndy Lin, CTO at top Nvidia partner Mark III Systems in Houston, Texas, told CRN that while demand for Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs and associated systems are \u201cobviously incredibly strong,\u201d it has \u201cset such a high bar\u201d for itself with several quarters of triple-digit growth.\n\u201cThese numbers are still astounding, especially on the year-over-year compare. But it's obviously less growth than before,\u201d he said.\nHowever, Lin said, some customers may be holding off from making any purchases right now as Nvidia transitions from Hopper-based systems to Blackwell-based systems.\n\u201cThere are definitely many organizations we see that have definitely not spent [money on new infrastructure and are waiting] on Blackwell. So the question is, how many of those there are, to what scale and what that's going to look like? And I think that could be one thing that maybe the market is underestimating a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However, if the AI chip designer\u2019s new products spur faster growth, now might be a buying opportunity.\n\n\nStock prices rise when companies exceed investor expectations and raise guidance, while they drop if companies fall short on either one. Nvidia is no exception to this rule.\n\nTo justify buying Nvidia stock now that it\u2019s the most valuable company in the world \u2014 having enjoyed a 195% rise in its share price to a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion this year \u2014 you must believe the company will keep beating and raising.\n\nIf Nvidia significantly exceeds conservative growth targets with help from Blackwell, the stock could rise despite slowing revenue growth, dependence on a few large customers, and the absence of a killer app to deliver a return on the rising investment needed to train and operate AI chatbots.\n\n\nReasons Nvidia Stock Could Drop\nNvidia stock presents investors with significant risks. These include the following:\n\nRevenue growth slowing down: Nvidia\u2019s revenues grew in a range of 206% to 265% during Q4 2023, Q1 2024, and Q2 2024. Nvidia\u2019s 94% revenue growth in the third quarter was still very rapid \u2014 but considerably slower than in previous quarters. Nvidia\u2019s forecast of 70% growth in Q4 is a continuation of this deceleration trend, according to my November Forbes post.\nDependence on small number of large customers: Nvidia has three key accounts \u2014 each of which contributes more than 10% of the company\u2019s total revenue, according to Social Press Blog. In the first nine months of 2024, these unnamed key accounts individually bought between $10 billion and $11 billion worth of goods and services from Nvidia, according to its latest quarterly filing with the SEC. These customers could be Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Super Micro, according to Bloomberg Intelligence global head of technology research Mandeep Singh. If Singh is correct, Super Micro\u2019s delayed financial statements could pose a risk to Nvidia investors.\nGrowing investment required to sustain generative AI: Investments to build generative AI \u2014 including data centers, chips, software, electricity, and water could top $1 trillion by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. To power their processing chips and cool the heat they emit, AI computer centers will continue to consume enormous amounts of electricity and water \u2014 rising from a range of 3% to 4% of the nation\u2019s total in 2024 to \u201cbetween 11% and 12% in 2030,\u201d reported the Wall Street Journal. Unless that investment yields faster revenue growth or much lower costs, companies could ultimately cut back \u2014 which could crimp Nvidia\u2019s growth.\nAbsence of a generative AI killer app that could yield a high return on investment: A killer app for generative AI that yields a high ROI remains elusive. Most people using generative AI are doing it to help them overcome, say, writer\u2019s block as they compose an email, according to the Boston Globe. A small number of companies are using AI to boost the productivity of business processes such as sales, customer service, and coding. While companies are seeking generative AI applications that produce faster growth, they are more concept than reality. If such a killer app does not emerge, companies will likely cut back on investing in generative AI \u2014 which could hurt Nvidia\u2019s growth.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\nReasons Nvidia Stock Could Keep Going Up\nMy guess is investors are baking all these negatives into their expectations. Indeed, despite Nvidia\u2019s slowing growth in 2024, the company\u2019s stock has continued to rise. This could be because the company did a good job of lowering investors\u2019 growth expectations to date.\n\nPositive surprises to growth would keep Nvidia stock rising. Huge orders for the company\u2019s latest chip line by the largest AI service providers \u2014 coupled with growing corporate interest in applying AI to make processes more efficient \u2014 could provide investors with unexpected good news. Here\u2019s how:\n\n\nBig Blackwell orders ahead: Blackwell chips are expected to generate $13 billion in Q4 2024 revenue for Nvidia. These chips are more energy efficient and faster than the company\u2019s previous high-end chips \u2014 \u201cabout 25 times as energy efficient,\u201d noted the Journal, with 30 times faster processing speed, Forbes reported.\nRise of Nvidia super clusters: The largest AI service providers are building multibillion-dollar super clusters of computer servers that \u201ccontain unprecedented numbers of Nvidia\u2019s most advanced chips,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. For example, in 2024 Elon Musk\u2019s xAI built Colossus \u2014 a supercomputer in Memphis \u2014 with 100,000 Nvidia Hopper AI chips. By next summer, xAI could host a super cluster with 300,000 Blackwell chips, according to the Journal. At $30,000 per chip, Musk\u2019s $9 billion worth of Blackwell chips could offer upside surprise for Nvidia investors.\nIncreased CEO talk about generative AI applications: In Q3 2024, CEOs discussed using AI and automation to streamline processes at a higher rate than quarters before, according to IOT Analytics. Some of the key AI-related use cases included process automation (up 59% since Q2), digital twin (up 35%); and conversational AI (up 28.6%). While it remains to be seen whether this talk will translate into faster growth, it could lead to a killer app for AI, which would benefit Nvidia.\n\nUntil Nvidia can unlock faster-than-expected growth, its stock could be stuck in a trading range.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

AI education must come at all levels, according to Stewart \u2014 however, higher education systems, in particular, need to be thinking about what\u2019s coming next, so graduating students can optimize their employability.\n\u201cGraduates need to understand AI, and need to have had touches in AI,\u201d he explained. Stewart emphasizes that this is broader than an engineering or a research challenge. \u201cThis is really a true workforce issue.\u201d\nStewart points to Gwinnett County in Georgia as an early education example, where the community has developed a full K-16 curriculum.\n\u201cIf young kids are already playing with AI on their phones, they should actually be thinking about it a little bit deeper,\u201d he said. The idea, he explained, is for kids to move beyond simply using the tech to start seeing themselves as future creators of new technology, and being part of the broader evolution.\nNobody Gets Left Out\u00a0\nBeyond the classroom, a comprehensive view of AI education would expose people in the broader community to AI learning opportunities, Stewart said. His experience in the public sector informs his decidedly inclusive view on the matter.\nBefore joining NVIDIA four years ago, Stewart spent more than a decade working for the state of California, and then its capital city of Sacramento. He points to his time as Sacramento\u2019s chief innovation officer to illustrate how important it is that all citizens be included in progress.\n\u201cSacramento was trying to move into a place to be an innovation leader in the state and nationally. I knew the city because I grew up here, and I knew that there were areas of the city that would never see innovation unless it was brought to them,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo if I was bringing autonomous cars to Sacramento, it was for the legislators, and it was for the CHP (California Highway Patrol), but it was also for the people.\u201d\nStewart elaborated that everyone coming in touch with self-driving vehicles needed to understand their impact. There was the technology itself \u2014 how autonomous vehicles work, how to use them as a passenger and so forth.\nBut there were also broader questions, such as how mechanics would need new training to understand the computer systems powering autonomous cars. And how parents would need to understand self-driving vehicles from the point of view of getting their kids to and from school without having to miss work to do the driving themselves.\nJust as individuals will have different needs and wants from AI systems, so too will different communities, businesses and states take different approaches when implementing AI, Stewart said.\nDiverse Approaches to AI Implementation\nPublic-private partnerships are critical to implementing AI across the U.S. and beyond. NVIDIA is partnering with states and higher education systems across the country for AI workforce development. And the programs being put in place are just as diverse as the states themselves.\n\u201cEvery state has their idea about what they want to do when it comes to AI,\u201d Stewart explained.\nStill, some common goals hold across state lines. When Stewart\u2019s team engages a governor\u2019s office with talk of AI to empower the workforce, create job opportunities, and improve collaboration, inclusivity and growth, he finds that state officials listen.\nStewart added that they often open up about what they\u2019ve been working on. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised at how far along some of the states are with their AI strategies,\u201d he said.\nIn August, NVIDIA announced it is working with the state of California to train 100,000 people on AI skills over the next three years. It\u2019s an undertaking that will involve all 116 of the state\u2019s community colleges and California\u2019s university system. NVIDIA will also collaborate with the California human resources system to help state employees understand how AI skills may be incorporated into current and future jobs.\nIn Mississippi, a robust AI strategy is already in place.\nThe Mississippi Artificial Intelligence Network (MAIN) is one of the first statewide initiatives focused on addressing the emergence of AI and its effects on various industries\u2019 workforces. MAIN works with educational partners that include community colleges and universities in Mississippi, all collaborating to facilitate AI education and training.\nEmbrace Technology, Embrace the Future\nStewart said it\u2019s important to encourage individuals, businesses and other organizations to actively engage with AI tools and develop an understanding of how they\u2019re benefiting the workforce landscape.\n\u201cNow is not the time to stay on the sidelines,\u201d said Stewart.\u201cThis is the time to jump in and start understanding.\u201d\nSmall businesses, for example, can start using applications like ChatGPT to see firsthand how they can transform operations. From there, Stewart suggests, a business could partner with the local school system to empower student interns to develop AI-powered tools and workflows for data analysis, marketing and other needs.\nIt\u2019s a win-win: The business can transform itself with AI while playing a crucial part in developing the workforce by giving students valuable real-world experience.\nIt\u2019s crucial that people get up to speed on the changes that AI is driving. And that we all participate in shaping our collective future, Stewart explained.\n\u201cWorkforce development is, I think, at the crux of this next part of the conversation because the innovation and the research and everything surrounding AI is driving change so rapidly,\u201d he said.\nHear more from NVIDIA\u2019s Louis Stewart on workforce development opportunities in the latest AI Podcast.\n\n\nCategories: The AI PodcastTags: Artificial Intelligence | Education | Trustworthy AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The series will also highlight the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries.\nWhether it\u2019s getting a complex service claim resolved or having a simple purchase inquiry answered, customers expect timely, accurate responses to their requests.\nAI agents can help organizations meet this need. And they can grow in scope and scale as businesses grow, helping keep customers from taking their business elsewhere.\nAI agents can be used as virtual assistants, which use artificial intelligence and natural language processing to handle high volumes of customer service requests. By automating routine tasks, AI agents ease the workload on human agents, allowing them to focus on tasks requiring a more personal touch.\nAI-powered customer service tools like chatbots have become table stakes across every industry looking to increase efficiency and keep buyers happy. According to a recent IDC study on conversational AI, 41% of organizations use AI-powered copilots for customer service and 60% have implemented them for IT help desks.\nNow, many of those same industries are looking to adopt agentic AI, semi-autonomous tools that have the ability to perceive, reason and act on more complex problems.\n\nHow AI Agents Enhance Customer Service\nA primary value of AI-powered systems is the time they free up by automating routine tasks. AI agents can perform specific tasks, or agentic operations, essentially becoming part of an organization\u2019s workforce \u2014 working alongside humans who can focus on more complex customer issues.\nAI agents can handle predictive tasks and problem-solve, can be trained to understand industry-specific terms and can pull relevant information from an organization\u2019s knowledge bases, wherever that data resides.\nWith AI agents, companies can:\n\nBoost efficiency: AI agents handle common questions and repetitive tasks, allowing support teams to prioritize more complicated cases. This is especially useful during high-demand periods.\nIncrease customer satisfaction: Faster, more personalized interactions result in happier and more loyal customers. Consistent and accurate support improves customer sentiment and experience.\nScale Easily: Equipped to handle high volumes of customer support requests, AI agents scale effortlessly with growing businesses, reducing customer wait times and resolving issues faster.\n\nAI Agents for Customer Service Across Industries\nAI agents are transforming customer service across sectors, helping companies enhance customer conversations, achieve high-resolution rates and improve human representative productivity.\nFor instance, ServiceNow recently introduced IT and customer service management AI agents to boost productivity by autonomously solving many employee and customer issues. Its agents can understand context, create step-by-step resolutions and get live agent approvals when needed.\nTo improve patient care and reduce preprocedure anxiety, The Ottawa Hospital is using AI agents that have consistent, accurate and continuous access to information. The agent has the potential to improve patient care and reduce administrative tasks for doctors and nurses.\nThe city of Amarillo, Texas, uses a multilingual digital assistant named Emma to provide its residents with 24/7 support. Emma brings more effective and efficient disbursement of important information to all residents, including the one-quarter who don\u2019t speak English.\nAI agents meet current customer service demands while preparing organizations for the future.\nKey Steps for Designing AI Virtual Assistants for Customer Support\nAI agents for customer service come in a wide range of designs, from simple text-based virtual assistants that resolve customer issues, to animated avatars that can provide a more human-like experience.\nDigital human interfaces can add warmth and personality to the customer experience. These agents respond with spoken language and even animated avatars, enhancing service interactions with a touch of real-world flair. A digital human interface lets companies customize the assistant\u2019s appearance and tone, aligning it with the brand\u2019s identity.\nThere are three key building blocks to creating an effective AI agent for customer service:\n\nCollect and organize customer data: AI agents need a solid base of customer data (such as profiles, past interactions, and transaction histories) to provide accurate, context-aware responses.\nUse memory functions for personalization: Advanced AI systems remember past interactions, allowing agents to deliver personalized support that feels human.\nBuild an operations pipeline: Customer service teams should regularly review feedback and update the AI agent\u2019s responses to ensure it\u2019s always improving and aligned with business goals.\n\nPowering AI Agents With NVIDIA NIM Microservices\nNVIDIA NIM microservices power AI agents by enabling natural language processing, contextual retrieval and multilingual communication. This allows AI agents to deliver fast, personalized and accurate support tailored to diverse customer needs.\nKey NVIDIA NIM microservices for customer service agents include:\nNVIDIA NIM for Large Language Models \u2014 Microservices that bring advanced language models to applications and enable complex reasoning, so AI agents can understand complicated customer queries.\nNVIDIA NeMo Retriever NIM \u2014 Embedding and reranking microservices that support retrieval-augmented generation pipelines allow virtual assistants to quickly access enterprise knowledge bases and boost retrieval performance by ranking relevant knowledge-base articles and improving context accuracy.\nNVIDIA NIM for Digital Humans \u2014 Microservices that enable intelligent, interactive avatars to understand speech and respond in a natural way. NVIDIA Riva NIM microservices for text-to-speech, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and translation services enable AI agents to communicate naturally across languages. The recently released Riva NIM microservices for ASR enable additional multilingual enhancements. To build realistic avatars, Audio2Face NIM converts streamed audio to facial movements for real-time lip syncing. 2D and 3D Audio2Face NIM microservices support varying use cases.\nGetting Started With AI Agents for Customer Service\nNVIDIA AI Blueprints make it easy to start building and setting up virtual assistants by offering ready-made workflows and tools to accelerate deployment. Whether for a simple AI-powered chatbot or a fully animated digital human interface, the blueprints offer resources to create AI assistants that are scalable, aligned with an organization\u2019s brand and deliver a responsive, efficient customer support experience.\nEditor\u2019s note: IDC figures are sourced to IDC, Market Analysis Perspective: Worldwide Conversational AI Tools and Technologies, 2024 US51619524, Sept 2024\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Conversational AI | NVIDIA Blueprints | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Riva \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The study looks at how organizations can achieve \u201cGreen AI\u201d in the coming decades and addresses AI\u2019s energy use.\nDeloitte analysis predicts that AI adoption will fuel data center power demand, likely reaching 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, and potentially climbing to 2,000 TWh by 2050. This will account for 3% of global electricity consumption, indicating faster growth than in other uses like electric cars and green hydrogen production.\nWhile data centers currently consume around 2% of total electricity, and AI is a small fraction of that, the discussion at COP29 emphasized the need to meet rising energy demands with clean energy sources to support global climate goals.\nEnergy Efficiency From the Ground Up\nNVIDIA is prioritizing energy-efficient data center operations with innovations like liquid-cooled GPUs. Direct-to-chip liquid cooling allows data centers to cool systems more effectively than traditional air conditioning, consuming less power and water.\n\u201cWe see a very rapid trend toward direct-to-chip liquid cooling, which means water demands in data centers are dropping dramatically right now,\u201d said Josh Parker, senior director of legal \u2013 corporate sustainability at NVIDIA.\nAs AI continues to scale, the future of data centers will hinge on designing for energy efficiency from the outset. By prioritizing energy efficiency from the ground up, data centers can meet the growing demands of AI while contributing to a more sustainable future.\nParker emphasized that existing data center infrastructure is becoming dated and less efficient. \u201cThe data shows that it\u2019s 10x more efficient to run workloads on accelerated computing platforms than on traditional data center platforms,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to reduce the energy consumed in existing infrastructures.\u201d\nThe Path to Green Computing\nAI has the potential to play a large role in moving toward climate-neutral economies, according to Deloitte\u2019s study. This approach, often called Green AI, involves reducing the environmental impact of AI throughout the value chain with practices like purchasing renewable energy and improving hardware design.\nUntil now, Green AI has mostly been led by industry leaders. Take accelerated computing, for instance, which is all about doing more with less. It uses special hardware \u2014 like GPUs \u2014 to perform tasks faster and with less energy than general-purpose servers that use CPUs, which handle a task at a time.\nThat\u2019s why accelerated computing is sustainable computing.\n\u201cAccelerated computing is actually the most energy-efficient platform that we\u2019ve seen for AI but also for a lot of other computing applications,\u201d said Parker.\n\u201cThe trend in energy efficiency for accelerated computing over the last several years shows a 100,000x reduction in energy consumption. And just in the past 2 years, we\u2019ve become 25x more efficient for AI inference. That\u2019s a 96% reduction in energy for the same computational workload,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00a0\nReducing Energy Consumption Across Sectors\nInnovations like the NVIDIA Blackwell and Hopper architectures significantly improve energy efficiency with each new generation. NVIDIA Blackwell is 25x more energy-efficient for large language models, and the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU is 20x more efficient than CPUs for complex workloads.\n\u201cAI has the potential to make other sectors much more energy efficient,\u201d said Parker. Murex, a financial services firm, achieved a 4x reduction in energy use and 7x faster performance with the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip.\n\u201cIn manufacturing, we\u2019re seeing around 30% reductions in energy requirements if you use AI to help optimize the manufacturing process through digital twins,\u201d he said.\nFor example, manufacturing company Wistron improved energy efficiency using digital twins and NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing OpenUSD applications for industrial digitalization and physical AI simulation. The company reduced its electricity consumption by 120,000 kWh and carbon emissions by 60,000 kg annually.\nA Tool for Energy Management\nDeloitte reports that AI can help optimize resource use and reduce emissions, playing a crucial role in energy management. This means it has the potential to lower the impact of industries beyond its own carbon footprint.\nCombined with digital twins, AI is transforming energy management systems by improving the reliability of renewable sources like solar and wind farms. It\u2019s also being used to optimize facility layouts, monitor equipment, stabilize power grids and predict climate patterns, aiding in global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nCOP29 discussions emphasized the importance of powering AI infrastructure with renewables and setting ethical guidelines. By innovating with the environment in mind, industries can use AI to build a more sustainable world.\nWatch a replay of the on-demand COP29 panel discussion.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate Sustainability | Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | Events | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhere AI and Graphics Converge: NVIDIA Blackwell Universal Data Center GPU Accelerates Demanding Enterprise Workloads\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many security organizations are already leveraging the power of GenAI through AI-powered security to help increase efficiency, accuracy, and upskill their teams. You can find examples of how you can leverage AI-powered security in your organization in this blog. Wiz utilizes generative AI as part of the Ask AI capabilities, including \u00a0AI-powered remediation, customization of Rego policies using AI, and AI graph query, providing natural language to graph query conversion. To further explore the power of GenAI, the Wiz Research Team experimented with a new AI-powered security use case for ML data classification, by leveraging NVIDIA AI. This blog explores how the Wiz Research Team explored using NVIDIA NIM for Meta Llama 3 models for data classification, with the goal of improving the accuracy and efficiency of sensitive database field identification.\u00a0NVIDIA NIM brings\u00a0 new levels of performance and efficiency to deploying open LLM, streamlining data-driven tasks, such as data classification. Our collaboration with\u00a0 Wiz demonstrates how AI through NIM can reshape data security\u2014enabling organizations to identify and secure their sensitive information with unprecedented precision and speed.Bartley Richardson, Director of Engineering at NVIDIAMachine Learning-based data classification\u00a0In today\u2019s data-centric world, securing sensitive information is crucial, especially for businesses that handle large volumes of personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, and other confidential assets. Wiz DSPM helps organizations protect their cloud data by discovering and classification sensitive data and assessing for data risks across their cloud footprint.\u00a0 \u00a0ML can have great benefits when it comes to data security as well. AI models can easily see the bigger picture to understand context and identify patterns of potential sensitive data easily. In our experiment, we leveraged LLM to try to understand if a database contains sensitive data based on the database name, table, and tables\u2019 schemas only. We then tried to identify what is the purpose of the database, for example, a database that is used to store application-related data or financial data, etc. Using LLM we were able to analyze all the information to classify if the database contains sensitive data. We also used LLM to describe what the database actually contains- for example, if it is specific application data (like WordPress), application logs, or CRM data.\u00a0Leveraging NVIDIA NIM for running Llama models\u00a0NVIDIA NIM, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, is a set of easy-to-use inference microservices for secure, reliable deployment of high-performance AI model inferencing. It allows organizations to innovate with AI faster by providing containers to self-host GPU-accelerated inferencing microservices for pretrained and customized AI models. In collaboration with NVIDIA, the Wiz Research Team explored using NVIDIA NIM for data classification. We used NIM microservices for Llama 3 models on AWS through the AWS Marketplace.\u00a0AI can have great benefits for data security use cases. By using NVIDIA NIM, we saw improved efficiency and accuracy of data classification and look forward further collaboration with NVIDIAErez Harus, AI Research Lead at Wiz\u00a0With easy setup and in less than one hour, we were able to deploy the Llama model using NVIDIA NIM with an OpenAI-compatible API in the most efficient way. According to our tests, the performance on NVIDIA NIM was 2x better than running the model as is, and 25% better than running on a popular open source framework on a single GPU. We were able to process more data faster on the same number of resources and easily scale by updating the NIM configuration to run multiple models on the same machine. For example, processing 1,000 samples of data took us on average 1.4 seconds with NIM, while it took 1.8 seconds with popular open source inferencing software, and almost 3 seconds with running the model as is. NIM was also easy to scale \u2013 we could run a few NIM instances on a stronger machine, allowing us to process data quickly.\u00a0We look forward to further exploring AI-powered security use cases and collaborating with NVIDIA.

Yaskawa\u2019s robots working alongside human coworkers in factories. To advance efforts like these virtually, Rikei Corporation develops digital twin tooling to assist planning.\nAnd if that weren\u2019t enough, diversified retail holdings company Seven & i Holdings is running digital twin simulations to enhance customer experiences.\nPhysical AI and industrial AI, powered by NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac and Metropolis, are propelling Japan\u2019s industrial giants into the future. Such pioneering moves in robotic manipulation, industrial inspection and digital twins for human assistance are on full display at NVIDIA AI Summit Japan this week.\nThe arrival of generative AI-driven robotics leaps couldn\u2019t come at a better time. With its population in decline, Japan has a critical need for advanced robotics. A report in the Japan Times said the nation is expected to face an 11 million shortage of workers by 2040.\nIndustrial and physical AI-based systems are today becoming accelerated by a three computer solution that enables robot AI model training, testing, and simulation and deployment.\nLooking Into the Future With Toyota Robotics\nToyota is tapping into NVIDIA Omniverse for physics simulation for robot motion and gripping to improve its metal forging capabilities. That\u2019s helping to reduce the time it takes to teach robots to transport forging materials.\nImage courtesy of Toyota.\nToyota is verifying to reproduce its robotic work handling and robot motion with the accuracy of NVIDIA PhysX with Omniverse. Omniverse enables modeling digital twins of factories and other environments that accurately duplicate the physical characteristics of objects and systems in the real world, which is foundational to building physical AI for driving next-generation autonomous systems.\nOmniverse enables Toyota to model things like mass properties, gravity and friction for comparing results with physical representations of tests. This can help work in manipulation and robot motion.\nIt also allows Toyota to replicate the expertise of its senior employees with robotics for issues requiring a high degree of skills. And it increases safety and throughput since factory personnel are not required to work in the high temperatures and harsh environments associated with metal-forging production lines.\nDriving Automation, Yaskawa Harnesses NVIDIA Isaac\u00a0\nYaskawa is a leading global robotics manufacturer that has shipped more than 600,000 robots and offers nearly 200 robot models, including industrial robots for the automotive industry, collaborative robots and dual-arm robots.\nImage courtesy of YASKAWA.\nThe Japanese robotics leader is expanding into new markets with its MOTOMAN NEXT adaptive robot, which is moving into task adaptation, versatility and flexibility. Driven by advanced robotics enabled by the NVIDIA Isaac and Omniverse platforms, Yaskawa\u2019s adaptive robots are focused on delivering automation for the food, logistics, medical and agriculture industries.\nUsing NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator, a reference workflow of NVIDIA-accelerated libraries and AI models, Yaskawa is integrating AI to its industrial arm robots, giving them the ability to complete a wide range of industrial automation tasks. \u00a0\nYaskawa is using FoundationPose for precise 6D pose estimation and tracking. These AI models enhance the adaptability and efficiency of Yaskawa\u2019s robotic arms, and the motion control enables sim-to-real transition, making them versatile and effective at performing complex tasks across a wide range of industries.\nAdditionally, Yaskawa is embracing digital twin and robotics simulations powered by NVIDIA Isaac Sim, built on Omniverse, to accelerate the development and deployment of Yaskawa\u2019s robotic solutions, saving time and resources.\nCreating Customer Experiences at Seven & i Holdings With Omniverse, Metropolis\nSeven & i Holdings is one of the largest Japanese\u00a0 diversified retail holdings companies.\u00a0The Japanese retail company runs a proof of concept to understand customer behaviors at its retail outlets with digital simulation.\nSeven & i Holdings is pushing its research activities by tapping into NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Metropolis to better understand operations across its retail stores. Using NVIDIA Metropolis, a set of developer tools for building vision AI applications, store operations are analyzed with computer vision models, helping improve efficiency and safety. A digital twin of this environment is developed in an Omniverse-based application, along with assets from Blender and animations from SideFX Houdini.\nImage courtesy of Seven & i Holdings Co.\nCombining digital twins with price recognition, object tracking and other AI-based computation enables it to generate useful behavioral insights about retail environments and customer interactions. Such information offers opportunities to dynamically generate and show personalized ads on digital signage displays targeted to customers.\nThe retailer plans to use Metropolis and the NVIDIA Merlin recommendation engine framework to create tailored suggestions to individual shoppers, responding to customer interests \u2014 based on data \u2014 like never before.\nVirtually Revolutionizing, Rikei Corporation Launches Asset Library for Digital Twins\nRikei Corporation, a systems solutions provider, specializes in spatial computing and extended reality technology for the manufacturing sector.\nThe technology company has developed JAPAN USD Factory, which is a digital twin asset library specifically for the Japanese manufacturing industry. Developed on NVIDIA Omniverse, JAPAN USD Factory reproduces materials and equipment commonly used in manufacturing sites across Japan in a digital form so that Japanese manufacturers can more easily build digital twins of their factories and warehouses.\nImage courtesy of Rikei\nRikei Corporation aims to streamline various stages of design, simulation and operations for the manufacturing process with these digital assets to enhance productivity with digital twins.\nDeveloped with OpenUSD, a universal 3D asset interchange, JAPAN USD Factory allows developers to access its asset libraries for things like palettes and racks, offering seamless integration across tools and workflows.\nTo learn more, watch the NVIDIA AI Summit Japan fireside chat with NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang.\n\n\nCategories: Corporate | RoboticsTags: Merlin | Metropolis | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA Isaac Sim | Omniverse Enterprise | Physical AI \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our open-source software and more than 750 NVIDIA-led open-source projects help democratize access to tools that accelerate AI development and innovation.\nEmpowering Cloud-Native Ecosystems\nNVIDIA has benefited from the many open-source projects under CNCF and has made contributions to dozens of them over the past decade. These actions help developers as they build applications and microservice architectures aligned with managing AI and machine learning workloads.\nKubernetes, the cornerstone of cloud-native computing, is undergoing a transformation to meet the challenges of AI and machine learning workloads. As organizations increasingly adopt large language models and other AI technologies, robust infrastructure becomes paramount.\nNVIDIA has been working closely with the Kubernetes community to address these challenges. This includes:\n\nWork on dynamic resource allocation (DRA) that allows for more flexible and nuanced resource management. This is crucial for AI workloads, which often require specialized hardware. NVIDIA engineers played a key role in designing and implementing this feature.\nLeading efforts in KubeVirt, an open-source project extending Kubernetes to manage virtual machines alongside containers. This provides a unified, cloud-native approach to managing hybrid infrastructure.\nDevelopment of NVIDIA GPU Operator, which automates the lifecycle management of NVIDIA GPUs in Kubernetes clusters. This software simplifies the deployment and configuration of GPU drivers, runtime and monitoring tools, allowing organizations to focus on building AI applications rather than managing infrastructure.\n\nThe company\u2019s open-source efforts extend beyond Kubernetes to other CNCF projects:\n\nNVIDIA is a key contributor to Kubeflow, a comprehensive toolkit that makes it easier for data scientists and engineers to build and manage ML systems on Kubernetes.
