Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $6.12, up 19% from the previous quarter and up 461% from a year ago.\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun \u2014 companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center \u2014 AI factories \u2014 to produce a new commodity: artificial intelligence,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cAI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue opportunities.\n\u201cOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\n\u201cWe are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere \u2014 from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs \u2014 through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.\u201d\nNVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of NVIDIA\u2019s issued common stock to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to NVIDIA\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024.\nNVIDIA is increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNVIDIA CORPORATION\n\n\n\u00a0CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

Is He Right?      Keith Speights, The Motley Fool   May 6, 2024 4 MINUTES_READ              IN_THIS_ARTICLE:  NVDA       MSFT       GOOG       AMZN       AMD            Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a Wall Street darling for quite a while now. And for good reason. The stock has roughly tripled over the past 12 months and is up more than sevenfold since September 2022. However, not everyone on Wall Street remains enthusiastic about Nvidia. One analyst thinks shares of the GPU maker will plunge close to 28% over the next 12 months. A prediction of trouble ahead D.A. Davidson's Gil Luria set a price target of $620 for Nvidia. That reflects expectations of a steep decline from the current share price of around $864. Why is Luria so bearish about the chip stock? He predicts potential trouble ahead due to a shift in spending by big technology companies. In particular, Luria thinks major Nvidia customers including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft will eventually have all the GPU capacity they need. He told BNN Bloomberg recently that these tech giants won't continue buying chips for generative AI indefinitely at the rate they've been buying.  All of these companies have developed their own AI chips. For example, Google announced its new Arm-based Axion chip in April. Meta rolled out the next generation of its custom-made MTIA chip last month as well. Amazon offers cloud customers the option of using its cost-effective Inferentia and Trainium2 chips to run AI apps. Microsoft has its Maia and Cobalt AI chips. Some big Nvidia customers have also turned to Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Meta and Microsoft are buying AMD's new Instinct MI300X chip. AMD claims the chip is better at AI inference than Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU. Others warning about Nvidia's risk Luria is in the minority on Wall Street. Of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG so far in May, 21 rate the stock as either a buy or a strong buy. However, he's not alone in sounding a warning about the risks for Nvidia. Richard Hunter, Interactive Investor's head of markets, has expressed concern that Nvidia could become a victim of inflated expectations. He also thinks tensions with China could hurt Nvidia's share price. Aswath Damodaran, the NYU finance professor known as the \"Dean of Valuation,\" likes Nvidia's business prospects but not its valuation. His model estimated a fair value for the stock of $436 -- close to half the current share price. Damodaran posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that he planned to sell half of his position in Nvidia. He said the stock \"was a bridge too far for me\" because of its premium price. Will Nvidia stock plunge? Could these negative predictions about Nvidia come true? Will the stock plunge 28% over the next 12 months? Maybe.   STORY_CONTINUES Nvidia is subject to the laws of supply and demand like any other business is. If the demand for AI chips slows as Luria expects, Nvidia stock will likely pull back. Luria told BNN Bloomberg, \"The higher we go this year, the more we're going to fall next year, and that's not in the stock.\" While he acknowledged that it could take longer than he predicted, Nvidia's current momentum won't last indefinitely.However, Nvidia has a strong first-mover advantage in the AI chip market. So far, demand remains strong. I wouldn't place a bet that Nvidia's shares will indeed fall 28% anytime soon. If it does happen, though, I think it will be a fantastic buying opportunity.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Here\u2019s Morningstar\u2019s take on what to look for in Nvidia\u2019s earnings and its outlook for Nvidia stock.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\n\u2022 Fair Value Estimate: $910.00\u2022 Morningstar Rating: 3 stars\u2022 Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide\u2022 Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High\nWith its 3-star rating, we believe Nvidia\u2019s stock is fairly valued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $910 per share, which implies an equity value of roughly $2.2 trillion. Our fair value estimate implies a fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025, or effectively calendar 2024) price/adjusted earnings multiple of 35 times and a fiscal 2026 forward price/adjusted earnings multiple of 26 times.\n\nWhat to Watch for In Nvidia\u2019s Q1 Earnings\n\u2022 Nvidia has been steadily beating its quarterly guidance while guiding for the upcoming quarter above FactSet consensus estimates. We anticipate more of the same in its May earnings report.\n\u2022 Nvidia\u2019s data centre business is still the focal point. Supply constraints still seem like the most significant cap on its artificial intelligence chip business. We continue to be interested in any commentary about whether (or how rapidly) Nvidia\u2019s manufacturing partners are expanding to satisfy demand for its AI graphical processing units.\n\u2022 The rapidly evolving AI market is crucial to the firm\u2019s long-term valuation, but we still have many questions about these markets. What is the pace of data center capital expenditure in 2024 and beyond? Cloud vendors have indicated that they will continue to spend above their prior expectations to invest in AI. We think that much of this spending will go into Nvidia\u2019s pockets. What does capital expenditure look like beyond the mega-cap cloud vendors? Enterprise spending at software vendors, financial services companies, healthcare firms, and the like also appears material.\n\u2022 What is the size of the AI accelerator market? Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0(AMD)\u00a0stunningly lifted its forecast for the 2027 industry total addressable market to $400 billion from $150 billion. This higher total addressable market includes other types of chips besides GPUs, but it still implies massive GPU growth, and Nvidia still dominates the AI GPU space.\n\u2022 How is Nvidia thinking about the chip development aspirations of these mega-cap technology customers? How will the firm combat these threats? When will its near-term supply constraints be resolved?\nWhat\u2019s Driving Nvidia\u2019s Stock Price?\nFor better or worse, both our fair value estimate and Nvidia\u2019s stock price will be driven by the company\u2019s prospects in the data centre, or DC, and AI GPU businesses. DC has already achieved exponential growth, going from $3 billion in fiscal 2020 to $15 billion in fiscal 2023 and then more than tripling to $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024. DC revenue appears to be constrained by supply, and we think Nvidia will continue to steadily boost revenue in each of the four quarters in fiscal 2025 as more supply comes online. Based on Nvidia\u2019s strong forecast start for fiscal 2025, we model DC revenue rising 113% to $101 billion over the year.\nWe model a 10% compound annual growth rate for the three years thereafter, as we think it is reasonable that the firm may face an inventory correction or a pause in AI demand at some point in the medium term. We model an average annual DC growth of 10% thereafter, and we consider this a reasonable long-term growth rate as AI matures.\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the full article\non Morningstar.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

Since the end of the last bear market in late 2022, Nvidia stock has surged 740%, valuing the company at a market cap of more than $2.3 trillion.\u00a0Those sizeable gains mean the semiconductor giant has returned roughly 20,000% to shareholders in the past decade. So, an investment of $500 in NVDA stock in May 2014 would be worth over $100,000 today.\u00a0Barchart However, despite Nvidia's monstrous gains, analysts remain bullish and expect the stock to move even higher. In this article, we look at a couple of reasons why analysts think Nvidia might be undervalued.Jefferies and HSBC Are Bullish on Nvidia StockAccording to a Seeking Alpha report, investment bank Jefferies just initiated coverage on Nvidia stock with a \u201cBuy\u201d rating. The analyst expects AI to account for 25% of semiconductor sales by 2027, up from 5% in 2022. Moreover, Jefferies explained that cloud-based capital expenditures are rising, acting as a tailwind for AI players such as Nvidia.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s latest AI processor iteration is a GPU (graphics processing units) called Blackwell, which was released recently. These processors are expected to perform AI tasks 2x faster while using less energy compared to Nvidia\u2019s current Hopper chips.\u00a0Separately, HSBC analyst Frank Lee reiterated his \u201cBuy\u201d rating on Nvidia and boosted the stock's price target from $1,050 to $1,350. The new target indicates an upside potential of over 46% from current levels.According to Lee, Nvidia enjoys strong pricing power across products such as server rack systems and processing platforms, which should allow the company to continue growing rapidly.\u00a0What's the Earnings Forecast for NVDA?Nvidia is forecast to release its fiscal Q1 of 2025 (ended in April) results on May 22. The consensus forecast calls for Nvidia to increase sales by 251% to $22.9 billion and earnings by 425% to $5.15 per share. By comparison, HSBC analyst Lee expects Nvidia to end Q1 with revenue of $28 billion.For the full fiscal year, analysts expect sales to rise by 71.3% to $104.37 billion and earnings to grow by 78% to $23.10 per share in fiscal 2025. If we zoom out further, Lee estimates earnings per share in fiscal 2026 to touch $45.16 per share, more than 50% higher than consensus estimates of $29.68 per share. The analyst's revenue forecast for fiscal 2026 is $196 billion, almost 50% higher than consensus estimates of $133 billion.\u00a0Investors continue to reset their forecasts, and given Nvidia\u2019s leadership position in the AI chip manufacturing space, it shouldn\u2019t surprise investors if the company beats these lofty estimates going forward.\u00a0Can Nvidia Stock Surge to $2,000?Out of the 40 analysts covering NVDA stock, 35 recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d two recommend \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and three recommend \u201chold.\u201d\u00a0The mean 12-month target price for NVDA stock is $986.01, indicating an upside potential of less than 7% from current prices. Investment bank Rosenblatt Securities has the highest 12-month price target of $1,400 for Nvidia stock.\u00a0Barchart According to consensus estimates, Nvidia might end fiscal 2029 with adjusted earnings of $60 per share. So, if NVDA is priced at 30x forward earnings, it might touch $1,800 by May 2028. If it trades at 35x, the stock should be trading at $2,100, indicating an upside potential of over 100% from current levels.\u00a0On the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Let's discuss whether NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most unstoppable AI stock. The company has been making headlines and popping up on the radars of analysts, hedge funds, and even retail investors on Wall Street Bets. To view the other unstoppable AI stocks, go to 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy. NVIDIA's Position in the AI Industry NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) produces the industry's leading GPUs for AI applications and has been at the forefront of the AI boom. The company's new Blackwell GPU, set to launch by the end of this year, is capable of producing trillion-parameter-scale AI models. The company also directs ample investment to the development of AI software products such as its Advanced AI platform for Enterprise that offers generative AI, data analytics, and inference.  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is signing deals with large tech players to push demand for its industry-leading GPUs. On May 21, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a collaboration with Microsoft to facilitate the development and deployment of AI applications. Microsoft Corporation has developed an AI model, the Phi-3 family of small language models, optimized to operate on NVIDIA GPUs. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also offers microservices such as the CuOpt route optimization AI that is added to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace and is part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise Platform. The two companies are also strictly involved in developing a range of optimizations and integrations for developers to create AI applications. These optimizations and integrations will be available in PCs powered by NVIDIA GeForce RTX and NVIDIA RTX GPUs. On May 22, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported strong earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The company reported earnings per share of $6.12, beating estimates by $0.54. The company reported a staggering $26.04 billion in quarterly revenue, up 262% year-over-year and ahead of market consensus by $1.45 billion. The company's data center revenue grew by 23% to reach $22.6 billion, primarily driven by the demand for its Hopper GPU computing platform. Large cloud providers who are customers of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI infrastructure, accounted for 40% to 50% of data center revenue. Here are some comments from the company's Q1 2025 earnings call: \"In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation\u2019s capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks.\"    Story Continues The comments also reinforced the role of its new Blackwell GPU:\"At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling.\"   Is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Most Unstoppable AI Stock to Buy Now?   Photo by Christian Wiediger on UnsplashWhat Does the Stock Split Mean for NVIDIA?NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also announced a 10-1 stock split and a dividend hike of 150% on May 22 along with its earnings release. On May 23, Lou Basenese, Public Ventures President and Chief Market Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance where he discussed the stock's performance after its awaited earnings release. The stock is up 90% year-to-date, as of May 23, and has reported strong earnings. The analyst, however, raised concerns about the slim margin by which NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) beat earnings. According to Basenese, the stock beat earnings expectations by 8%, the smallest it has ever been, relative to its 40% beat in the first blowout quarter preceding the AI hype. In response to NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision for the stock split, Basenese hinted that the move was great if looked through a psychological lens. He suggests that 40% of trading volume comes from retail investors, and the stock split will eventually push more in retail. He concludes the discussion by highlighting that NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0 products are the backbone of AI applications produced by mega-tech companies, meaning the earnings results were quite predictable.On May 23, Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and raised their price target from $1,000 to $1,160. Rosenblatt, on the other hand, maintained a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a price target of $1,400. Over the past three months, 36 Wall Street analysts have held buy-equivalent ratings on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and have an average price target of $1,104. The stock's high forecast of $1,400 represents an upside of 35% from its current price of $1,041.19, as of May 23. According to analysts polled by Yahoo Finance, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings per share is expected to expand by 94% in 2025, compared to 2024. Despite NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong earnings report and a stellar year-to-date performance, the company ranks second on our list of the most unstoppable stocks to buy.

Shares of Nasdaq-100 component Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), for instance, have shot up 221% in the past year. The chipmaker's terrific rally is justified by its outstanding growth. Nvidia's monopoly-like position in the market for AI chips -- where it holds 95%-plus market share according to some estimates -- has supercharged the company's top and bottom lines, which is evident from the chart below.   NVDA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.   What's more, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to increase at a healthy annual rate of 38% over the next five years. Based on Nvidia's earnings of $12.96 per share in the recently concluded fiscal 2024, its bottom line could jump to almost $65 per share after five years, according to analyst estimates.  Even if Nvidia trades at 30 times earnings after five years, in line with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple, its stock price could jump to $1,950. That would be a 112% jump from current levels. However, Nvidia isn't the only stock that's winning big from the rapid adoption of AI. There are two other Nasdaq stocks that are making the most of the AI opportunity and they could deliver more upside than Nvidia over the next five years. 1. Super Micro Computer Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has outperformed Nvidia in the past year with stunning gains of 505%. Supermicro, which is known for manufacturing AI server solutions, can continue to outperform Nvidia over the next five years, thanks to the fast-growing market it operates in. Supermicro's servers are deployed by data center operators to mount chips from the likes of Nvidia and other chipmakers, which keeps their operating costs in check. Supermicro's modular server solutions aim to lower electricity and cooling costs in data centers.  For instance, Supermicro launched liquid-cooled server solutions for deploying Nvidia's massively popular H100 chips in May last year, claiming that they can reduce electricity costs in data centers by 40%. Additionally, Supermicro claims that its liquid-cooled H100 servers could reduce cooling costs by 86% when compared to existing data centers. Considering the significant amount of electricity that AI data centers consume, the demand for Supermicro's servers is booming. This explains why the company's revenue and earnings grew remarkably in the previous quarter. Super Micro's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended March 31) tripled year over year to $3.85 billion. Its earnings jumped fourfold to $6.65 per share.   Story Continues Supermicro's full-year guidance now calls for revenue to increase 110% year over year to $14.9 billion at the midpoint. Earnings are expected to jump to $23.69 per share from $11.81 per share in the same period last year. Even better, analysts are expecting its earnings to increase at an annual rate of 62% for the next five years.That won't be surprising as the market for AI servers is expected to clock annual growth of 30% over the next decade. Supermicro is growing faster than the market it serves, which explains why analysts are expecting its earnings growth to remain robust. Assuming the company's bottom line does grow at 60% a year for the next five years, its earnings could hit $124 per share after five years.Multiplying the projected earnings with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $3,720 after five years, a 348% jump from current levels. Even if growth rates taper off, Supermicro still has a better growth probability than Nvidia. So, Supermicro looks like a solid alternative to Nvidia for investors looking to buy an AI stock right now, given that it seems capable of outperforming the latter over the next five years.2. Meta PlatformsMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is another tech giant that's capitalizing on the adoption of AI. The social media bellwether has been integrating AI tools into its different platforms and is also leveraging the technology to help advertisers increase returns on their spending.CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's AI initiatives in detail on the company's first-quarter earnings conference call last month. He claimed that the company's generative AI assistant, Meta AI, has been tried by \"tens of millions of people,\" and it will be rolled out in more countries and languages in the future.Meta AI is being integrated into WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. From allowing creators to generate high-quality images to enabling businesses to suggest products for customers, Meta Platforms is setting itself up to monetize its AI offerings in the long run. According to Zuckerberg:On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions, and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement which naturally leads to seeing more ads, and improving ads directly to deliver more value. The good news for investors is that Meta's AI offerings are giving the company's growth a nice boost. Its revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $36.4 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, shot up an impressive 114% year over year to $4.71 per share. Meta should be able to sustain a healthy earnings growth rate in the long run as it starts monetizing more of its AI offerings.Analysts are currently expecting the company's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 28% over the next five years, which would be a nice jump over the 11% annual earnings growth it has clocked in the past five years. Using its 2023 earnings of $14.87 per share as the base, Meta's bottom line could jump to $51 per share in five years based on the potential earnings growth that analysts expect it to deliver.Multiplying that with the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 30 points toward a stock price of $1,530 after five years, a 229% jump from current levels. Given that the stock is trading at 27 times earnings right now, investors are getting a good deal on this Nasdaq stock that seems capable of outperforming Nvidia in the long run.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia's first quarter results, released after the bell on Wednesday, showed adjusted earnings per share (EPS) tallied $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a jump of 461% and 262%, respectively, from a year ago.  The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend, following some of its Big Tech peers in doling out heftier quarterly payments to shareholders. Analysts were expecting adjusted EPS of $5.65 on revenue of $24.69 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.09 on revenue of $7.19 billion in the same quarter last year. In the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. That\u2019s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    116.91 -2.62 (-2.19%)  As of 2:59:06 PM EDT. Market Open.     Advanced Chart    \u201cOur data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \"Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\" Wall Street analysts have previously raised concerns about the share of Nvidia's Data Center revenue that comes from hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other Big Tech names. That's especially true as those companies roll out their own AI accelerator chips.  In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's earnings report on Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips. \"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\" Nvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. CFO Colette Kress said in a statement on Wednesday that large cloud providers accounted for around 45% of the company's Data Center revenue. In a note to clients published Thursday, JPMorgan analysts led by Harlan Sur wrote Nvidia, \"continues to maintain a 1-2 step lead ahead of competitors.\" JPMorgan raised its price target on Nvidia stock to $1,150 from $850 and reiterated an Overweight rating on shares.   Story Continues  On the company's earnings call, Kress pointed out that revenue out of China was down significantly in the quarter, as the company was forced to halt shipments of its most powerful chips to the country. The company also expects the market in the region to remain very competitive going forward.The company's stock split \u2014 in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own \u2014 will be effective June 7, and its new dividend will be paid June 28 to shareholders as of June 11.The stock split will likely fuel speculation Nvidia could be added to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), joining Big Tech peers like Apple (AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft.Nvidia's beefed-up dividend also follows similar moves announced so far this year from the likes of Meta (META) and Alphabet, which both initiated quarterly dividends for the first time, and Apple, which raised its dividend earlier this month.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating? When Is Debt Dangerous? Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA  What Is NVIDIA's Net Debt? You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in January 2024, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$26.0b in cash, so it actually has US$16.3b net cash.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Debt to Equity History May 2nd 2024   How Healthy Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet? The latest balance sheet data shows that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$10.6b due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.1b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$26.0b in cash and US$10.00b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$13.2b more liquid assets than total liabilities.  This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$2.04t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load! Better yet, NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 489% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.   Story Continues Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 80% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Summing UpWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that NVIDIA has net cash of US$16.3b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$27b. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

NVDA posted revenue of $15 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 5.98\u2014a massive increase from just a year ago and above estimates.The stock rose above $1,000 for the first time after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and delivering a rosy outlook fueled by the artificial intelligence boom.Analysts were quick to move up their price targets in the following days, encouraged by the company\u2019s revenue forecast of $28 billion for the current quarterWhat the split means for investorsThe stellar numbers weren\u2019t the only thing investors cheered about; Nvidia also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 7.On that day, the stock\u2019s price will be split, or divided, by 10. That means the price will convert to a tenth, or 10%, of the current value, and existing shareholders will receive ten shares for every one share owned.This increases the liquidity of the stock, allowing more investors, especially those with smaller accounts, to participate in purchasing shares, effectively increasing the investor base.What it means for options tradersFor options traders who are holding a trade through a split, the number of Nvidia options contracts will increase by a factor of ten, while the strike price will shrink by a factor of ten\u2014maintaining the mechanics of the trade pre-split. For example, if you are holding a $1,200 call option and continue to hold it through the split, it will automatically convert to a $120 call option (strike price) but you will have ten of those contracts.Traders should keep the theta and gamma of those options in mind.Theta: The lower price of the stock means that the strike prices will be lower. That said, short premium strategies will collect less premium in absolute terms. However, this won\u2019t change in percentage terms, and the risk-reward on traders will remain relatively constant on trades if the split were doesn\u2019t occur.Gamma: Because the stock will have a lower price, the dollar value for the gamma\u2014the rate at which delta changes\u2014will be reduced. That would resulting in smaller changes relative to the delta because the equivalent percentage change in the stock represents a smaller dollar move on an absolute basis.The table outlines the hypothetical changes that will occur post-split based on today\u2019s Nvidia price of 1,053.Greeks/Trade MechanicsPre-Split ($1,053)Post-Split ($105.30)Delta0.5 (50%) per contractRemains 0.5 (50%) per contract\n\nGamma0.02 per $1 stock move- Smaller absolute impact per $1 moveTheta-0.05 per daySmaller absolute decay due to lower option pricesStock Price$1,053$105.30Delta Change (per $1 stock move)Delta changes by 0.02 per $1 move (0.5 to 0.52)Delta changes by 0.02 per $1 move (0.5 to 0.52) but with a smaller absolute impactAccessibility for TradersHigher contract value limits some tradersLower contract value makes options more accessiblePremiumHigher due to higher stock priceLower due to reduced stock price\nThomas Westwater, a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience. @fxwestwaterFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit\u00a0tastylive\u00a0or the YouTube channels\u00a0tastylive\u00a0(for options traders), and\u00a0tastyliveTrending\u00a0for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\u00a0Trade with a better broker,\u00a0open a tastytrade account\u00a0today. tastylive, Inc. and tastytrade, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.\u00a0Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices. The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Nvidia is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price. Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.  For Nvidia, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher. Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.   Story Continues Earnings Estimate Revisions for NvidiaFor the fiscal year ending January 2025, this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to earn $25.10 per share, which is a change of 93.7% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Nvidia. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>The upgrade of Nvidia to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Catherine Brock covers personal finance and investing. for\u00a0Investor HubFollow AuthorMay 14, 2024, 01:36pm EDTUpdated May 14, 2024, 01:36pm EDTShareSaveComment(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Getty Images\nNvidia (NVDA), the darling of AI and technology investors, will report results from its first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on May 22. The details of that release will either support or undercut Nvidia's massive $2.2 trillion valuation and the investment community's obsession with AI stocks.\n\n\nLet's establish the context for this much-anticipated earnings release. We'll cover why investors are excited about NVDA's first quarter, key metrics to watch, challenges and opportunities for the chip designer and analyst expectations for the near and long-term.\n\nAnticipation For Nvidia's Earnings Report\nNvidia has been working on AI solutions since 2012. In that year, the company launched an AI application that could classify images. Called AlexNet, the application was trained in days and ran on two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs. The realization that GPUs could accelerate machine learning versus regular processors shaped a new strategic direction for Nvidia. That's essentially when the company began its quest to become a leader in AI solutions.\n\nEleven years later in 2023, ChatGPT sparked a race to launch generative AI solutions. From the big tech companies to niche software providers, seemingly everyone started working to get their generative AI tools into the hands of eager customers.\n\nNvidia, now the dominant leader in AI hardware and software, has benefited directly from the AI application race. The company's fiscal year 2024 earnings releases show an increasing demand for its AI products. By year-end, Nvidia's AI division, called Data Center, had grown its annual revenue 217% from the prior year. Company-wide revenue grew 126%.\nThe growth fueled a tripling of the NVDA stock price between May 2023 and May 2024. That value spike prompted rumors of an upcoming Nvidia stock split and divided many investors into two camps. Some say Nvidia is fairly valued. Others argue the stock is overpriced and the opportunity for investors to benefit from Nvidia's AI success has passed.\n\nThis first quarter earnings release could quiet the overvaluation argument or turn it up. More specifically, Nvidia's recent performance will speak to the company's ongoing growth potential and the runway for value creation in AI generally.\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download Forbes' most popular report, 12 Stocks To Buy Now.\nNVDA's Key Metrics To Watch\nThe metrics to watch in NVDA's first quarter earnings report include:\n\n\nTopline revenue growth. Nvidia expects revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. That would equate to a 233% increase versus the first quarter revenue in the prior year of $7.19 billion. Sequential revenue growth would be 8.5%.\nData Center revenue growth. Data Center revenue was $4.3 billion in last year's first quarter and $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter. \nGaming revenue growth. Gaming revenue was $2.2 billion in last year's first quarter and $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter. \nGross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin was 66.8% in last year's first quarter and 76.7% in the fourth quarter. For this first quarter, Nvidia has guided to a non-GAAP gross margin of 77%, plus or minus 50 basis points. \nOperating expenses. The company's non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion in last year's first quarter and $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The non-GAAP operating expenses guidance is $2.5 billion.\nAdjusted diluted EPS. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.1 in last year's first quarter and $5.2 in the fourth quarter. \n\n\nUpcoming Challenges And Opportunities For Nvidia\nNvidia will face these challenges going forward:\n\n\nGrowing competition from other chip makers, including Advanced Micro Devices\nAMD\n and Intel\nINTC\n.\nSteep investor expectations for AI stocks may inhibit further price appreciation going forward. A slightly positive result in the upcoming quarter could be met with indifference from investors who expected more.\nA supply imbalance recently announced by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) could limit Nvidia's growth potential over the next several months.\nA restriction on AI chip sales to China was imposed on Nvidia by the U.S. government last September. The restriction hasn't tempered Nvidia's growth story so far, but it is a factor to watch.\n\n\nNvidia's largest opportunity lies in product development. The company can leverage and extend its dominant position by continuing to roll out faster and more powerful solutions.\nFortunately for shareholders, Nvidia has a knack for self-improvement. In March, the company announced its upcoming, next-generation AI offering, Blackwell GPUs. The new GPUs are said to be twice as powerful for training AI models versus Nvidia's prior-generation chip.\nAnalyst Expectations\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to report an adjusted, diluted EPS of $5.57 for the quarter ending on April 28, 2024. That expectation has increased by $0.05 in the last 30 days and by $0.70 in the last 90 days. A $5.57 EPS number would translate to 411% quarter-over-quarter growth and 8% sequential growth.\nNotably, two key Nvidia suppliers, Taiwan Semiconductor and SK Hynix, both recently reported surprisingly strong numbers\u2013prompting a small rally on NVDA stock. TSM announced 60% revenue growth in April, while SK Hynix posted 144% quarter-over-quarter sales growth.\nIt's also worth pointing out that Nvidia has delivered positive revenue and earnings surprises in seven of the most recent eight quarters. So it is likely that the official revenue guidance of $24 billion was a conservative view when Nvidia published it in February.\nNVDA Stock's Long-Term Outlook\nThe consensus price target for NVDA stock is $999, representing 12.5% upside. That target already assumes Nvidia will have a positive earnings result for the first quarter.\nLonger term, analysts believe Nvidia's fiscal year 2025 EPS will come in around $24.84\u2014roughly double the fiscal year 2024 result. Like the expectation for the first quarter, that estimate has been trending up over the last three months.\nThe EPS expectation for the following year is $29.44. That's a more tempered growth expectation relative to the current fiscal year, but still a significant prediction. The implications are that AI demand has a runway and Nvidia will continue to dominate in this space.\nBottom Line\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia's first quarter results to gauge the stock's valuation and the growth potential in AI investing going forward. The likely outcome is a positive earnings surprise, but whether it's enough to fuel another NVDA rally remains to be seen.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)What key factors may drive Nvidia's earnings?\u00a0Ongoing demand for AI chips and related solutions will be a key driver for Nvidia's first quarter earnings.\u00a0What are analyst expectations for Nvidia's earnings?\u00a0Analysts expect Nvidia to exceed its earnings guidance with an adjusted, diluted EPS of roughly $5.57 per share.\u00a0How may Nvidia's earnings impact the stock market?\u00a0Nvidia is the third largest company in the S&P 500, comprising over 5% of the index.

That compares to the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 11% gain over the same time. Indeed, the overall chip sector has outperformed\u2014rising about 34% for the year to date\u2014but Nvidia\u2019s performance is undeniable. Will the stellar returns continue after it announces earnings?What do investors expect?Analysts expect NVDA to post earnings per share (EPS) of $5.48 and revenue of $24.7 billion, according to Yahoo Finance. That would be up from EPS of $0.98 and revenue of $6.5 billion a year ago, and up from last quarter\u2019s $5.16 EPS and $22.1 billion revenue.Over the past 30 days, those estimates have come down just a bit, falling from an expected EPS of $5.53. However, the current expected figure is up from $4.87 per share 90 days ago.Nvidia has exceeded expectations in four of the last four earnings reports, which sets investors up to expect that trend to continue. While competitors like AMD and Intel have made progress, Nvidia holds a commendable lead in the graphic processing unit (GPU) market, commanding about 80% of global market share for the chips\u2014which are preferred for artificial intelligence applications.Nvidia\u2019s guidance will be key to the stock price reaction on Wednesday and where it opens the following trading day. Data center operators have put out optimistic growth plans that will require a lot of processing power. They will likely have to source much of that from Nvidia. Will this translate into a strong outlook for its chips?Supply problems will likely need to be addressed in some fashion, as they have been a challenge for the chip sector since the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether Nvidia will be able to keep up with any lofty demand goals is another important question investors want answered.Trading Nvidia earningsNvidia trades with an implied volatility rank (IVR) of 68.8 and the stock is near its all-time highs traded back in March.The implied move based on the May 24 options expiration strike shows an implied move of +/- 89 points. A hypothetical trade with a neutral to positive outlook would be a short put vertical with the short strike at the implied move, which would be at 860 based on the May 16 price of 948.With the long strike at the 855 put, it would give a probability of profit of 78% and a max profit of $110 and a max loss of $390.Thomas Westwater,\u00a0a tastylive financial writer and analyst, has eight years of markets and trading experience.\u00a0@fxwestwaterFor live daily programming, market news and commentary, visit\u00a0tastylive\u00a0or the YouTube channels\u00a0tastylive\u00a0(for options traders), and\u00a0tastyliveTrending\u00a0for stocks, futures, forex & macro.\u00a0Trade with a better broker,\u00a0open a tastytrade account\u00a0today. tastylive, Inc. and tastytrade, Inc. are separate but affiliated companies.\u00a0Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.

Power companies have also dominated, Bank of America says. The firm notes that Vertiv, which makes power and cooling equipment for data centers, has beaten Nvidia by 315% over the past year. The performance represents a broadening-out of the AI trade to include utility, industrial, and commodity companies.   Nvidia remains a kingpin trade amid the artificial intelligence frenzy, but investors too narrowly focused on GPU chips have missed out on an even more lucrative opportunity. In a new note, Bank of America notes that stock gains for Vertiv \u2014 which makes power and cooling equipment for data center \u2014 have outpaced Nvidia returns by a whopping 315 percentage points over the past year. They're starting the comparison on May 24, 2023, right after Nvidia's first blowout quarter, which set off the entire AI boom in stocks. To be exact, Vertiv has climbed 516% since the date, handily outpacing Nvidia's 211% gain. The benchmark S&P 500 has risen a comparatively paltry 29% over the same period. \"Vertiv is the real AI darling,\" BofA wrote in a client note.   Bank of America  BofA says Vertiv's stellar performance is representative of the AI rally broadening out to include an increasing range of sectors. Much of that stems from the advanced chips that power AI on \u2014 such as the ones Nvidia produces \u2014\u00a0 requiring significantly more electricity to operate. That offers upside to industrials, utilities, and commodities, according to the firm. \"GPUs need 2-2.5x more power than CPUs, and expected power usage for US data centers under construction is equivalent to more than 50% of the power currently used by US data centers,\" Bank of America wrote on Monday. \"Power used by AI applications is expected to grow at a 25-33% CAGR over the next few years.\"   Bank of America  Others, such as \"Big Short\" investor Steve Eisman, have pointed out that the boost to power usage also makes these GPUs considerably hotter, putting pressure on firms such as Vertiv to improve cooling systems in data centers. Eisman has long been a bull on US infrastructure. Aside from AI, he's betting that green policy will boost these sectors as well. As Nvidia gears up for its earnings season on Wednesday, expectations remain strong, Bank of America said. The company has also set its own bar high, judging from its last twelve months: it's added $1.5 trillion in market cap and trailing earnings per share have rocketed 617%. \"But it's not just about NVDA anymore,\" the note said, adding: \"Fundamentals are broadening out and so should the market: NVDA drove 37% of S&P earnings growth over the LTM (and 11% of return), but is expected to drive just 9% over the next 12 months.\"   Story Continues Previously, Goldman Sachs had similarly outlined broadening AI investment, characterizing Nvidia as the first of four phases. Eventually, utility investments will take over, at which point firms that can best integrate AI software start winning out.Read the original article on Business Insider  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

With 67% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.  And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$2.3t in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 173% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NVIDIA, beginning with the chart below.  See our latest analysis for NVIDIA    NasdaqGS:NVDA Ownership Breakdown May 24th 2024   What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.   NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth May 24th 2024   Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NVIDIA. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO has 3.5% of the shares allocated to their name.  On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.   Story Continues Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in NVIDIA Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$93b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 29% stake in NVIDIA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

But since then, the leading maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) has found new markets for its chip technology, namely around artificial intelligence (AI), fueling incredible growth for the business. This AI hype has led investors to bid up Nvidia's share price to about $925 to account for the company's surging revenue and growth prospects.\n\nUltimately, what determines whether a share price goes up or down long term is the growth, or lack thereof, of a company's revenue and profits.\nAnd if Nvidia continues to see this unprecedented demand for its GPUs, the stock could climb even higher.\nHere's why Nvidia can keep growing\nFor a long time, Nvidia primarily sold its GPUs for professional graphics artists and video gamers. But these powerful processors, originally intended to render graphically demanding applications, are also suited to training AI models like OpenAI's famous ChatGPT.\nNvidia's annual revenue has increased nearly 500% over the last five years, mostly driven by its data center business.\n\n\n\n\n\nData center revenue, which now makes up 83% of the top line, grew an astounding 409% year over year in the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. Management expects total revenue to increase another 234% year over year in its fiscal 2025 first quarter.\nIt's unheard of for a company reporting over $60 billion in annual revenue to put up growth rates like this, but enterprise spending on data centers is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Cloud service providers are investing heavily in the infrastructure needed to provide AI-related services to their customers, and CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this year that the existing $1 trillion of data centers will likely double to $2 trillion before 2030.\nBecause Nvidia dominates the market for GPUs, in addition to supplying many other components necessary to build these data centers, it's not hard to see the company maintaining its current momentum going forward. That would mean even more upside for shareholders.\n\n\n\nJohn Ballard has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

On April 29, 2014, Disney's Captain America: The Winter Soldier\u00a0was the U.S. monthly box-office champ, Tesla had just begun delivering its Model S cars to China, and Activision Blizzard (now owned by Microsoft) was two days away from revealing its videogame Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.\nThe above paragraph was meant not only to take you back in time but also to give you an idea of the diversity of artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) customers. All the companies mentioned use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for various applications.\nWith the stage set, let's answer the question: How much money would your Nvidia stock investment be worth now had you invested $5,000 in the stock a decade ago?\nFrom $5,000 to nearly $1 million in a decade\nHad you invested $5,000 in Nvidia stock on April 29, 2014, your investment would be worth about $990,485, as of April 29, 2024. This amount assumes you reinvested the modest dividends Nvidia pays. For context, the S&P 500 index (widely considered the best proxy for the broad U.S. stock market) would have turned your 5 grand into $16,410 over the same period.\nNow, let's dive into what drove Nvidia stock to its fantastic return over the last 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot of Nvidia's stock and business a decade ago\nNvidia was founded in 1993 and went public in 1999. So, a decade ago, it had been in business for 21 years and publicly traded for 15 years. On April 29, 2014, Nvidia stock closed at a split-adjusted price of $4.67 per share. Its closing price was $4.43 when adjusted for both stock splits (Nvidia has had five stock splits) and dividends.\nBelow is what Nvidia's business looked like in the quarter reported about a decade ago and in its most recently reported quarter.\n\n\n\nMetric/Topic\n\nQ4 Fiscal 2014 (Ended Late Jan. 2014)\n\nQ4 Fiscal 2024 (Ended Late Jan. 2024)\nGrowth\n\n\nRevenue\n$1.14 billion\n$22.10 billion\n1,839%\n\n\nAdjusted net income\n$187 million\n$12.84 billion\n6,766%\n\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$0.08*\n$5.16\n6,350%\n\n\nBusiness snapshot\nBulk of revenue came from gaming and professional visualization (pro viz) markets**\nRevenue breakdown by platform: 83% data center, 13% gaming, 2% pro viz, 1% auto\nN/A\n\n\n\nData source: Nvidia. *Reported result was $0.32. This number is adjusted for the 4-for-1 stock split in 2021. **Nvidia didn't break out its revenue at this time in the same way it does now.\nNvidia's revenue has grown tremendously. Its 1,839% revenue growth over the decade equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 35%. Even better, its profits have soared at a much faster pace. Its 10-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6,350% equates to a nearly 52% CAGR.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's AI-driven data center platform is driving its overall growth\nNvidia's data center platform has been the company's biggest growth driver over the last 10 years. It's more profitable than the company's overall business, which is why Nvidia's earnings have been rising significantly faster than its revenue over the last decade.\nThe data center platform's growth is being fueled by the rapid adoption of AI by companies and other entities. Nvidia is a huge beneficiary of this trend because it's the dominant supplier of AI chips for data centers. In the company's most recently reported quarter (fiscal Q4 2024), its total revenue surged 265% year over year, while its data center revenue skyrocketed 409%.\nNvidia's data center business had been growing at a fast clip for some time, but its growth exploded starting in calendar year 2023, thanks to generative AI. This new technology burst onto the scene in late 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot. Demand for this tech is so robust because it expands the potential applications of AI.\nAI is still in its relatively early innings. It's not too late to consider buying Nvidia stock.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Walt Disney. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2026 $395 calls on Microsoft and short January 2026 $405 calls on Microsoft.

Notably, Stephen F. Lynch, who represents Massachusetts\u2019 8th congressional district, acquired NVDA stock for his retirement account. The move underscores the fact that the tech juggernaut \u2014 whose products drive artificial intelligence (AI) related functions is more than just a vehicle for speculation.\nAccording to financial disclosure documents, the transaction occurred on May 22 and was reported the following day. The value of the acquisition ranges between $1,001 to $15,000. The transaction date is significant because Nvidia released its first-quarter earnings result on that day. To recap, it was a blockbuster print, with the company posting earnings of $6.12 per share on record quarterly revenue of $26 billion.\nAnother noteworthy fact was that Lynch acquired this stake in NVDA stock for his individual retirement account (IRA). Since the doldrums of 2022, speculators have piled into Nvidia shares for the underlying dominance in the AI arena. However, Lynch\u2019s acquisition confirms that NVDA can also be a vehicle for retirement.\nPros and Cons of NVDA Stock for Retirement Savings\nWhile NVDA stock isn\u2019t the typical idea that pops into mind for retirement ideas, it offers powerful catalysts that can bolster portfolios. First and foremost, Nvidia is the dominant force behind AI-focused hardware. According to information compiled by Bloomberg, the generative AI ecosystem could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032.\nFurther, Nvidia sells the necessary picks and shovels of the AI industry. It\u2019s difficult in any circumstance to decipher which specific AI-focused enterprise or brand will win out its individual sector. However, all digital-intelligence-based protocols require advanced processors to function. With Nvidia commanding a dominant presence, acquiring NVDA stock over the long run makes sense.\nOn the other hand, there are also cons to consider. First, Nvidia offers only a minuscule dividend. It\u2019s investing in its growth, which is arguably the smart thing to do. However, retirement stocks typically involve passive income.\nSecond, NVDA stock isn\u2019t the only name in town for processing hardware. For example, while many enterprises acquire Nvidia chips for datacenter-related needs, tech juggernauts such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have been developing their own advanced processors to reduce their dependency on Nvidia.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This exclusive club includes six of the \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. Nvidia is the only pure-play semiconductor and data center services business with a trillion-dollar valuation right now. But as Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Qualcomm, and more vie with it to meet the world's demand for cutting-edge processors, I wouldn't be surprised to see more chip stocks gain entrance into the trillion-dollar club. But I don't expect any of those three will become the next chip stock to reach a market cap of $1 trillion. I predict instead that it will be Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), currently the ninth most valuable business in the world, worth $806 billion. The hidden gem of the chip industry Nvidia and AMD each develop sophisticated chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs provide the computing power to myriad generative AI applications including machine learning, training large language models, accelerated computing, and more. While that puts Nvidia and its rivals front and center in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, investors might be surprised to learn that they \u2014 and many other chip companies \u2014 rely heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor.  While Nvidia, AMD, and many others design GPUs and other chips, they actually outsource most of their manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor \u2014 the world's most productive third-party chip fabricator \u2014 brings their chips to life. It also boasts Amazon, Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm, and Sony as major customers.   Image Source: Getty Images   Remember to think long term In the first quarter, the company's revenue rose 13% year over year to $18.7 billion, a result that came in at the high end of management's guidance range. One thing that you might notice from the chart above is that Taiwan Semiconductor's revenues and operating profits have fluctuated in recent quarters. That's natural. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Taiwan Semiconductor is not immune to the business conditions that impact its clients. During the first-quarter earnings call, management pointed to seasonality in the smartphone business in particular as being responsible for some of the fluctuations in revenue and profit margins. Nevertheless, its long-term outlook remains strong. Analysts' consensus estimate for Taiwan Semiconductor's 2024 revenue is approximately $84 billion \u2014 representing 21% growth year over year.   Story Continues It's clear that demand for GPUs will change in the short term. This is because many companies that have been buying up the most powerful chips are still figuring out exactly how AI will play into their long-term roadmaps. For this reason, while I expect corporations to allocate more capital toward those chips over time, the growth of the market isn't going to be linear.Although fluctuations in demand will impact Taiwan Semiconductor's business, the long-term secular trends fueling AI should continue benefiting the company. The key theme here is that investors will need to remain patient as Taiwan Semiconductor's newest growth story is very much in its early chapters.Is now a good time to buy Taiwan Semiconductor stock?The chart below benchmarks Taiwan Semiconductor against a large set of players operating in various aspects of the semiconductor landscape.Trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.3, Taiwan Semiconductor stock has a valuation right in the middle of that pack. I find the steep premium Nvidia stock now carries to be fascinating. While the company is surely experiencing record growth thanks to its leading GPUs and data center services, its relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor might be underappreciated.Indeed, considering how many chip designers rely on Taiwan Semiconductor in some form or fashion, it could be argued that the company's role within the chip realm is being discounted.I am bullish on AI in the long run, and see Taiwan Semiconductor continuing to play a critical role in its progression. I think as companies such as Nvidia and AMD continue to innovate and release new products, it will increasingly land on more investors' radar.Given these dynamics, I see Taiwan Semiconductor following Nvidia to a trillion-dollar valuation sooner rather than later.Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

The browser\u2019s latest release taps local NVIDIA RTX GPUs to make streaming and video better than ever.\nPixel Perfect\nFirst announced at CES in January 2023, RTX Video is a collection of AI video enhancements that improve the quality of videos played on browsers through platforms like YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+. The technology makes videos streamed on NVIDIA GeForce RTX-powered PCs and RTX-powered workstations appear sharper and more detailed without requiring a higher-resolution source.\n\nRTX Video is made up of two parts. RTX Video Super Resolution upscales low-resolution video for cleaner, crisper imagery. It works by analyzing the lower-resolution video and using deep learning to predict what the higher-resolution version should look like. The algorithm then combines this predicted image with a traditionally upscaled version to reduce or eliminate compression artifacts and sharpen the final output.\nRTX Video HDR goes one step further: when enabled, it analyzes standard dynamic range (SDR) video content through AI neural networks to add high-dynamic range (HDR) information, improving visibility, details and vibrancy.\nSince 90% of video online is 1080p or lower and SDR, enabling RTX Video is like pushing the \u201cremaster\u201d button on most of the content users watch everyday.\nPretty Foxy\nMozilla Firefox now supports RTX Video Super Resolution and HDR in its latest stable version (v126). It\u2019s never been easier for users to access AI-enhanced upscaling, de-artifacting and HDR effects for online videos.\n\u201cVideo is a core pillar of the modern web, and we are committed to delivering a great experience for our users,\u201d said Bobby Holley, chief technology officer of Firefox at Mozilla. \u201cMozilla is integrating RTX Video into Firefox to improve video quality for our users with compatible GPUs.\u201d\nFirefox joins other Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, in supporting RTX Video. RTX Video Super Resolution is also supported in popular video players like VLC.\nEnabling RTX Video is easy:\n\nUpdate to the latest GeForce RTX Game Ready Driver, NVIDIA Studio or NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Driver.\nEnsure Windows HDR features are enabled by navigating to System > Display > HDR.\nOpen the NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to Adjust Video Image Settings > RTX Video Enhancement.\nTurn on \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d and \u201cHigh Dynamic Range.\u201d\n\nNote that RTX Video HDR requires an NVIDIA GeForce RTX or RTX professional GPU connected to an HDR10-compatible monitor or TV.\nFor more information, check out the RTX Video FAQ.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

But what does historical data say about this? For traders keen on efficiently managing portfolio risks in times of market distress, understanding this behavior is crucial. Let's delve into historical data to test the validity of this hypothesis.A key tool in deciphering these connections is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly known as the market's \u201cfear index.\u201d For example, during high VIX periods, signaling considerable fear or uncertainty, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and broader market indices such as the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), tend to align more closely.Typically, NVDA and SPY have a moderate positive correlation of 0.56.NVDA/SPY correlation during turmoilHowever, this correlation climbs notably during market turmoil compared to calmer periods.This pattern of stocks moving together isn\u2019t just seen in individual stocks but across different sectors of the economy.Technology companies like Apple (AAPL), energy entities represented by the Energy ETF (XLE) and retail behemoths such as Costco Wholesale (COST), all exhibit this pattern. Normally, their correlations are modest, yet during volatile market phases, they intensify remarkably.The correlation among these diverse sectors or their representatives sharpens to an average of 0.84, transforming from moderate to strongly positive.Corrections negate diversificationThe increasing similarity in movements among different stocks and sectors during high volatility challenges the conventional strategy of investment diversification\u2014the practice of spreading investments to manage risk. In essence, when everything declines simultaneously, the benefits of diversification are negated.In such scenarios, ironically, reducing overall market exposure may prove to be more effective than employing complex trading strategies like hedging with additional positions, which could introduce further risks due to these synchronized market movements.Recognizing how stocks are interconnected during varying market conditions is essential, not only for traders but for anyone interested in making well-informed investment decisions amid uncertainties. By examining these relationships, investors can devise more effective strategies to manage and navigate through these turbulent times.Kai Zeng, director of the research team and head of Chinese content at tastylive, has 20 years of experience in markets and derivatives trading.

Isaac Manipulator is a collection of foundation models and modular GPU-accelerated libraries that help industrial automation companies build scalable and repeatable workflows for dynamic manipulation tasks by accelerating AI model training and task reprogramming.\nFoundation models are based on a transformer deep learning architecture that allows a neural network to learn by tracking relationships in data. They\u2019re generally trained on huge datasets and can be used to process and understand sensor and robot information as magically as ChatGPT for text. This enables robot perception and decision-making like never before and provides zero-shot learning \u2014 the ability to perform tasks without prior examples.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Intrinsic, a leading robotics software and AI company,\u00a0 demonstrates the potential for a universally applicable robotic-grasping skill to work across grippers, environments and objects.\n\u201cFor the broader industry, our work with NVIDIA shows how foundation models can have a profound impact, including making today\u2019s processing challenges easier to manage at scale, creating previously infeasible applications, reducing development costs, and increasing flexibility for end users,\u201d said Wendy Tan White, CEO at Intrinsic, in a blog post announcing the collaboration with NVIDIA.\u00a0 (White will deliver a keynote address at Automate about what the rise of AI means for innovation and growth, on Thursday, May 9, at 7 a.m. PT.)\nDeveloping Better Robot Grip With Isaac Manipulator\nGrasping has been a long sought after robotics skill. So far it\u2019s been time-consuming, expensive to program and difficult to scale. As a result, many repetitive pick-and-place conditions haven\u2019t been seamlessly handled to date by robots.\nSimulation is changing that. Enlisting NVIDIA Isaac Sim on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform, Intrinsic generated synthetic data for vacuum grasping using computer-aided design models of sheet metal and suction grippers. This allowed Intrinsic to create a prototype for its customer Trumpf Machine Tools, a leading maker of industrial machine tools.\n\nThe prototype uses Intrinsic Flowstate, a developer environment for AI-based robotics solutions, for visualizing processes, associated perception and motion planning. With a workflow that includes Isaac Manipulator, one can generate grasp poses and CUDA-accelerated robot motions, which can first be evaluated in simulation with Isaac Sim \u2014 a cost-saving step \u2014 before deployment in the real world with the Intrinsic platform.\nUnder the collaboration, NVIDIA and Intrinsic plan to bring state-of-the-art dexterity and modular AI capabilities for robotic arms, with a robust collection of foundation models and GPU-accelerated libraries to accelerate a greater number of new robotics and automation tasks.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 7, at 11 a.m. CT, NVIDIA Senior Research Scientist Adithya Murali and Intrinsic Chief Science Officer Torsten Kroeger will demonstrate the companies\u2019 work in the session \u201cAutomating Smart Pick-and-Place With Intrinsic Flowstate and NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator \u201d in the Intrinsic booth 2808 at Automate.

The positive moves come as investors await heavily anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA), set for release after the bell on Wednesday. The Nasdaq recovered from earlier session lows to rise about 0.2%, capping off Tuesday's trading day with another consecutive record close. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), which also reached a record, rose about 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed roughly 0.2%.  Nvidia's upcoming report is expected to spur a big move in its share price and jumpstart stocks more broadly. In the meantime, a wave of quarterly reports from retailers offered some insights into the state of the consumer and the health of the economy. Lowe's (LOW) sales dropped less than expected as cash-strapped Americans continued to spend on small repairs, while Macy's (M) shares gained after the department store chain's earnings beat a low bar. Investors have also listened closely to speeches from Federal Reserve officials as a dearth of economic releases starves the rate-cut debate of fuel. Fed governor Chris Waller said Tuesday he needs to see several more months of favorable inflation data before lowering rates, echoing the higher-for-longer policy stance of other central bank leaders in recent weeks.

Given the chip giant's role in the AI rally over the past year, and its large weighting in the S&P 500, the release is expected to have wide implications for the broader market. This had led many to speculate on where the stock could land come the end of trading on Thursday. As of last Friday's close, options were pricing in about an 8.5% move in shares in either direction. Reuters noted that this would translate to a \"market cap swing of $200 billion \u2014 larger than the market capitalization for about 90% of S&P 500 companies.\"A notable move by any account, for sure. But perhaps more interesting when considering options-implied earnings reactions for Nvidia is just how wrong they've been as of late.As our chart of the day from the equity research team at Bank of America shows, the options-implied moves for Nvidia on the Friday before earnings have been a poor indicator of whether the stock will move more or less than expected.In the second and third quarters, options pricing projected a large move and it didn't come. Leading into the most recent report, pricing fell short of the actual move.And so, like most highly anticipated releases, no matter how much we talk up the event before it happens, it's simply hard to know how the market will react until it does.

As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:The company confirmed its Tesla Semi remains on track for production-spec deliveries to customers by 2026 while offering more details on range and payload capacity for the EV truck.Speaking at the Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) Expo in Las Vegas, Tesla exec Dan Priestley said, \"We're building a factory in Nevada that is being ramped in 2026 for customer deliveries, and ramping to eventual target capacity to 50,000 units a year.\"Currently, the Tesla Semi is in pilot testing with PepsiCo\u2019s FritoLay division. Priestley said PepsiCo would be receiving an additional 50 trucks in its fleet for the pilot program. The company is currently testing approximately 35 trucks.In his presentation, Priestley said the company's long-range Semi would have a range of up to 500 miles with a 23,000-lb vehicle weight.Its standard-range truck would be capable of 300-mile trips with an unladen 20,000-lb vehicle weight.In real-world testing with PepsiCo, Tesla Semis performed long-range runs of 250 and 520 miles with a gross vehicle weight including cargo of up to 82,000 lbs, the maximum allowed by law.NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  Tesla, Inc.

Half of that loss, according to DJT, was due to one-time payments related to the closing of the company's SPAC merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. in March.\u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in the earnings release.Trump maintains a roughly 60% stake in Truth Social. At current levels of around $44 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $6 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $3.6 billion.

That followed a first quarter where the readings were consistently hotter than expected. The Fed's goal is to get inflation down to 2%.  Fed governor Christopher Waller. (Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)  \u00b7 Sarah Silbiger via Getty ImagesWaller became the latest central bank official to stress a higher-for-longer stance. On Monday, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr both called for holding rates where they are, allowing more time for restrictive policy to work.Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear last week that he thinks the Fed will need more than a quarter's worth of data to really make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling toward 2%. Waller appears to want more, noting he would like to see \u201cseveral\u201d months of data.That implies it will take more than three inflation reports for the Fed to feel confident about lowering rates from a 23-year high, putting the odds on a first rate cut in September at the earliest if the data supports such a move.

It reiterated its full-year targets. Shares dipped around 3%.Meanwhile, Macy's beat muted first quarter expectations.

One of them being that sales are declining at hundreds of other Macy's stores that will likely be closed over the next few years. You have to evaluate the entire company, not just 50 stores, as the company's earnings release language would like for one to do.Further, the company's commentary on the consumer wasn't exactly confidence-inspiring as to how the back-to-school shopping period will shake out.Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the earnings breakdown here.

Signs of an inflation cooldown prompted markets to grow more optimistic about the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and stocks rallied as a result, with all three major averages hitting record highs on Wednesday.  For the week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 1%, closing above 40,000 for the first time ever on Friday.  In the week ahead, highly anticipated earnings results from Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to be the key catalyst for markets. Results from Target (TGT), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), and Lowe's (LOW) will also be closely tracked by investors. The week is expected to be quieter on the economic front, with updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors as well as the final reading of consumer sentiment for May on tap. Minutes from the Fed's May meeting are also expected on Wednesday afternoon. SNP - Free Realtime Quote \u2022 USD  S&P 500 (^GSPC)   Follow    View Quote Details    5,621.67 -53.45 (-0.94%)  As of 2:59:30 PM EDT. Market Open.   ^GSPC ^IXIC ^DJI   Advanced Chart    Minute by minute April's reading of the Consumer Price Index showed core prices, which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas, rose 3.6% over last year \u2014 the lowest annual rise in three years. This prompted investors to price in two full interest rate cuts this year for the first time since early April. The move brings the market closer in line with the Fed's projections of two or three interest rate cuts at some point this year. BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski listed investors' alignment with the Fed on interest rate cuts as a reason supporting his call for the S&P 500 to end 2024 at 5,600, an increase of less than 7% from Friday's close.  For investors, the key question will be whether this bullish narrative is sustainable or if the market will once again jump ahead of the Fed as it did in early 2024 when investors priced in nearly seven interest rate cuts on the back of positive economic data. The first test will come on Wednesday with the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's May meeting, which will provide a deeper look at the discussion among officials. \"The minutes from the May FOMC meeting should sound more hawkish on the margin than Chair Powell's press conference,\" Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. \"Though Powell signaled the bar for hikes is high and that standing pat is the proper response to disinflation stalling out, others on the committee were more concerned about whether policy was doing enough.\"   Story Continues   Fed Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference at the end of Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 2024. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)  \u00b7 SAUL LOEB via Getty ImagesThe bulls are on the runBelski's year-end target bump was followed by another forecast raise on Friday. Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha boosted his year-end target for the benchmark to 5,500 from 5,100. Chadha cited robust earnings growth and an improving macroeconomic outlook as reasons stocks could keep moving higher.\"We see the earnings cycle having plenty of legs,\" Chadha said. \"While all the growth may not materialize this year, we see market confidence in a continued recovery rising by year end, supporting equity multiples.\" Nvidia's big reportAI leader Nvidia is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, capping off the reports from America's tech giants. Expectations are once again sky-high for the chipmaker. Analysts expect Nvidia grew earnings by more than 400% in the prior quarter while revenue increased 242%, per Bloomberg consensus data.For the second quarter, analysts project earnings growth of more than 120% and nearly 100% revenue growth.\"We see enough room for NVDA to post FQ1E (April) revenue potentially as high as $26B (data center ~$22-23B) and potentially guide to ~$27-28B in total revenue (data center ~$25-26B) \u2014 both good enough to keep the stock biased higher, in our view,\" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a note to clients previewing the earnings release.

(REUTERS/Robert Galbraith)  \u00b7 REUTERS / ReutersThe stock is up more than 86% in 2024 and more than 200% over the past year since Nvidia kicked off the AI hype train with its blowout earnings report in May 2023. Given how Nvidia's stock has impacted other potential AI plays, and the broader market as a whole, all eyes will be on whether the company can once again live up to the hype.\"If [Nvidia] can continue their enviable, remarkable string of beating estimates, raising guidance, then beating the raised guidance next quarter, that means that the AI trade can and will proceed apace,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a research note on Thursday. \"If there is even the slightest sign of weakness, however, much more than that stock alone will suffer.\"NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price \u2022 USD  NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)   Follow    View Quote Details    117.08 -2.44 (-2.05%)  As of 2:59:35 PM EDT. Market Open.   NVDA ^GSPC   Advanced Chart   The expansion of the AI tradeNvida's updates on its emerging technology demand come at a crucial time for the overall AI story. Increasingly, new companies in sectors are being tabbed AI trades.Just this past week, Dell shares rose about 10% as analysts from Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI revealed bullish research on the company's AI prospects.The AI trade has already been expanding beyond the popular names like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META). Energy and Utilities are two of the best performing sectors in the S&P 500 this year, both adding more than 13%. While strategists have pointed to a catch-up trade in Utilities (XLU), AI has also been a driver of enthusiasm. The same could be said for Energy (XLE).Research from Goldman Sachs' equity strategy team led by David Kostin shows mentions of AI soared in the first quarter amid a \"broadening of the AI trade.\" More than 66% of companies in the energy sector mentioned AI during their earnings calls this quarter, up from 19.1% last quarter.JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jack Manley said whether the AI story has legs \"might be one of the more important questions that we have to ask.\"\"Is this AI stuff the real deal or is it a flash in the plan?\" Manley told Yahoo Finance. \"And I mean, frankly, the jury is still out on whether or not it will fundamentally transform the world.\"He added, \"If markets wake up to say 'Hey, maybe we got a little bit too excited about this and maybe we pulled forward some of these earnings just a little bit, and that's reflected in those valuations.' That's where I think you have the potential for a bit of a shaky road.\" \u00a0Weekly calendarMondayEarnings: Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Trip.com (TRIP), Zoom (ZM)Economic news: No notable economic news.

Advancements also include the ability to simplify AI application development for faster time to value with the integration of NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, deployment automation and more.\nHuang discussed the concept of an AI factory, likening it to the factories of the last industrial revolution that used water to produce electricity. In the current industrial revolution, data centers act as AI factories, transforming data and electricity into valuable data tokens distributed globally.\n\u201cWhat has happened is instead of just producing software, we\u2019re now producing intelligence \u2014 that intelligence is formulated in the form of tokens that can then be expressed in any information modality that we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d Huang explained.\nHuang underscored the importance of full-stack accelerated computing to enable this, noting NVIDIA\u2019s advancements.\nTogether, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world\u2019s industries with a full-stack offering \u2014 including computing, networking, storage, services and software \u2014 that drives copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins.\nMichael Dell introduced the latest innovations for the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, emphasizing their ability to simplify and accelerate customers\u2019 AI journeys.\n\u201cWe are unleashing this super genius power. Everyone is going to have access to this technology \u2014 and it\u2019s gonna get smarter,\u201d Dell said.\nThe Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, announced earlier this year, offers a full stack of AI solutions from data center to edge, enabling organizations to quickly adopt and deploy AI at scale.\nThis platform integrates Dell\u2019s AI capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge technologies, providing customers with an expansive AI portfolio and an open ecosystem of technology partners.\nThe Dell AI Factory, based on the NVIDIA partnership, will help establish AI sovereignty for countries by enabling strong data security and customized AI service development.\nTogether, Dell and NVIDIA will bring these capabilities to companies, help stand it up, and help develop new applications that enterprises can deploy, Huang said.\n\u201cOur partnership between us is really about that, literally from the ground up building AI factories and delivering it to the world\u2019s enterprises as a solution,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Nvidia has traded more dollar volume versus any of those names in all but two days this year, both of which were following the release of earnings reports by Meta. For reference, in 2022, Apple topped this leaderboard on about 80% of occasions. Year to date, through May 29, $4.1 trillion has changed hands in Nvidia stock. Its peers aren\u2019t even close.But Nvidia isn\u2019t just trading more than other tech titans individually \u2014 increasingly, it\u2019s trading more than all of them as a group.40 times so far this year, Nvidia\u2019s stock traded more dollar volume than Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook combined. For context, Amazon has done that once since the end of 2019, and Apple has accomplished the same feat twice over that span. That\u2019s it.Marc Andreessen proclaimed that software is eating the world back in 2011. Well, right now, Nvidia\u2019s H100 semiconductors are swallowing the US stock market.More MarketsSee all MarketsJ.

Luke Kawa3hThe Magnificent 7 are finally acting as a group \u2014 besides Apple, they\u2019re all tumbling togetherWell, perhaps there\u2019s one reason to continue to refer to the Magnificent 7 as an amorphous collective after all. And it\u2019s a bad news story: with the exception of Apple, the group of stocks is trading like a cohesive unit. By falling, a lot.2024 was a year defined by the ability of these megacap tech companies to trade largely independently of one another, even as most were getting more and more levered to the AI theme, either through sales or capex.The correlation disinflation between these trillion-dollar companies was one of the most critical factors in keeping overall stock market volatility compressed. That\u2019s gone out the window.We\u2019ve seen that turn on a dime from the S&P 500\u2019s record highs until now. At the time of the benchmark US stock index\u2019s closing peak, the average correlation between members of the Magnificent 7 over the trailing month was its lowest since 2021. That has since exploded during a market rout that\u2019s been principally characterized by a breakdown in high-flying momentum stocks, especially those tied to AI.In a crisis, as they say, correlations go to one.Apple, with just a 34% correlation to the other members of the cohort over the past 21 sessions, is playing the biggest role as a volatility dampener at the moment. But the world\u2019s biggest publicly traded company is just a sandbag in the face of a tsunami at the moment.Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon all hit fresh 2025 lows this morning.Luke Kawa4hThree of the Magnificent 7 are hitting fresh 2025 lowsThe pain in megacap US tech leaders hit fresh 2025 highs today as some members of the Magnificent 7 sank to their lowest levels of the year.Alphabet is now trading where it was in September, Amazon is at its lowest level since November, and Meta is at prices not seen since December. The Mark Zuckerberg-led company is now negative on the year for the first time.To put it mildly, the so-called Magnificent 7 are not living up to that name as investors ditch US stocks and lower their exposure to the tech sector.Latest StoriesSherwood Media, LLC produces fresh and unique perspectives on topical financial news and is a fully owned subsidiary of Robinhood Markets, Inc., and any views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of any other Robinhood affiliate, including Robinhood Markets, Inc., Robinhood Financial LLC, Robinhood Securities, LLC, Robinhood Crypto, LLC, or Robinhood Money, LLC.Privacy NoticeDisclosuresTerms and ConditionsEditorial StandardsMastheadYour Privacy ChoicesAdvertising Disclaimers\u00a92025 Sherwood Media, LLC"

As vehicles transition into smart, connected entities, the demand for intuitive human-machine interfaces and advanced driver assistance systems has surged.\nIn this journey toward automotive intelligence, Cerence, a global leader in AI-powered mobility solutions, is tapping NVIDIA\u2019s core expertise in cloud and edge technologies to redefine the in-car user experience.\nIn a recent video, Iqbal Arshad, chief technology officer of Cerence, emphasized the point, stating: \u201cGenerative AI is the single biggest change that\u2019s happening in the tech industry overall.\u201d\n\nThe cornerstone of Cerence\u2019s vision lies in the development of its automotive-specific Cerence Automotive Large Language Model, or CaLLM. It serves as the foundation for the company\u2019s next-gen in-car computing platform, running on NVIDIA DRIVE.\nThe platform, unveiled in December, showcases the future of in-car interaction, with an automotive- and mobility-specific assistant that provides an integrated in-cabin experience.\n\u201cWe have datasets from the last 20 years of experience working in the automotive space,\u201d Iqbal said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re able to take that data and make that an automotive-ready LLM.\u201d\nGenerative AI a Game-Changer for the Automotive Industry\nGenerative AI enables vehicles to comprehend and respond to human language with remarkable accuracy, revolutionizing the way drivers interact with their cars.\nWhether it\u2019s initiating voice commands for navigation, controlling infotainment systems or even engaging in natural language conversations, generative AI opens a realm of possibilities for creating more convenient and enjoyable driving experiences.\nCerence is striving to empower vehicles with the cognitive capabilities necessary to seamlessly assist drivers in navigating their daily routines.\nThe company leverages NVIDIA DGX Cloud on Microsoft Azure, providing dedicated, scalable access to the latest NVIDIA architecture, co-engineered at every layer with Microsoft Azure, optimized for peak performance in AI workload training. NVIDIA\u2019s inferencing technology helps Cerence deliver real-time performance, facilitating seamless user experiences.\nAs Cerence sees it, the future is one of intelligent driving, where vehicles aren\u2019t just modes of transportation, but trusted companions on the road ahead.\n\u201cGenerative computing is going to change your in-car experience,\u201d said Iqbal.\nWith generative AI at its core, driving will evolve into a personalized, connected and, ultimately, safer experience for all.\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Generative AITags: DGX Cloud | NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here's What Investors Need to Know.\n\n\n  \n      By Danny Vena\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      May 22, 2024 at 6:48PM\n    \n  \n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's long track record of performance has fueled a surge in its stock price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which will take place in June. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a stock split alone isn't a reason to buy Nvidia shares, there are still plenty of reasons to buy the semiconductor specialist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.11%)\u00a0-$2.52\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.01\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:58 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis marks the largest stock split to date for the chipmaker.\n\nRecent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have captured the public imagination over the past year or so. One of the byproducts of this trend has been the surging stock prices of companies at the forefront of this paradigm shift in technology. Nowhere is this more apparent than with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA -2.11%), whose graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for AI.\nThe company's consistent execution and unrivaled business performance have fueled its meteoric ascent. Nvidia stock has gained 540% since early last year, driven by triple-digit revenue and profit growth resulting from surging demand for AI. Yet that's just the beginning. Since Nvidia's IPO in early 1999, the stock has soared from a split-adjusted price of $0.25 to more than $939, representing eye-popping gains of 375,500%.\nOn Wednesday, in conjunction with the release of the company's quarterly results, Nvidia announced plans to split its stock for the first time since July 2020. The stock has gained more than 800% in the nearly four years since, which is likely the catalyst for the split. This revelation is sparking a fresh wave of interest in an already well-followed stock. Let's review the mechanics of a stock split and what it means for investors.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe stock-split details\nNvidia announced that its board of directors had approved a 10-for-1 forward stock split. This will result from an amendment to the company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which Nvidia says \"will result in a proportionate increase of the number of shares of authorized common stock.\"\nAs a result of this split, shareholders of record as of June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of stock for each share they own after the market close on Friday, June 7. The stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia investors won't need to take any steps in order to receive the additional shares of stock. Brokerage firms and investment banks handle the particulars, with the adjustments being handled behind the scenes. The stock-split shares will simply appear in investor accounts with no further action necessary. The timing can vary from brokerage to brokerage, so investors shouldn't worry if the newly issued shares aren't there immediately on June 7, as it can take hours, or in some cases days, for the additional shares to make an appearance.\nAdding numbers can provide context regarding how the stock-split process plays out. For each share of Nvidia stock a shareholder owns -- it's currently trading for roughly $950 per share (as of this writing) -- post-split, investors will hold 10 shares worth $95 each.\nIs a stock split a good thing?\nAs the above example shows, the total value of ownership won't change based on the split alone; it's merely a different way of viewing the whole. Put another way, if you buy a pizza, it doesn't matter if you cut it into eight slices or 16 slices -- the total amount of pizza remains the same. By the same token, Nvidia stockholders will simply have a greater number of lower-priced shares.\nThere are those who believe that investor psychology will ultimately play a part, with excitement about the upcoming stock split driving up the share price. It's also been suggested that the lower share price can increase demand for those shares among retail investors. Indeed, management notes in the announcement that the purpose of the split is to \"make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" While that's frequently the case, that kind of temporary euphoria historically subsides, leaving investors to focus on what matters -- the company's operational and financial performance -- which will ultimately drive the stock price higher or lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nWhile the stock split alone isn't reason enough to buy Nvidia, there are plenty of reasons the semiconductor specialist is a buy. Investors need to look no further than the company's financial report for evidence to support that contention.\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia reported revenue that soared 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, marking an 18% quarter-over-quarter increase. This drove adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 461% to $6.12.\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $24.65 billion and EPS of $5.59, so Nvidia sailed past expectations with ease.\nIf there was any doubt, robust demand for generative AI fueled record data center revenue of $22.6 billion, up 427% year over year and representing 87% of Nvidia's total sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother important announcement for shareholders is that Nvidia increased its quarterly dividend by 150%, from $0.04 to $0.10 per share, or $0.01 on a post-split basis. The first increased dividend payment will be made on June 28. Even at the new, higher level, the yield will still be paltry, amounting to just four-tenths of 1%.\nIt's still very early in the AI revolution, which is even more reason to be optimistic. The worldwide AI market clocked in at $2.4 trillion in 2023 and is expected to rise to $30.1 trillion -- a compound annual growth rate of 32% -- by 2032, according to Expert Market Research. As the gold standard for GPUs used in AI, Nvidia is well positioned for future success.\nInvestors shouldn't buy shares for the pending stock split. However, Nvidia's long track record of consistently strong operating and financial results -- and blistering stock price gains -- show why it continues to be such a winning investment.\nSome investors will balk at Nvidia's valuation, but you get what you pay for. Despite four consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue and EPS growth, Nvidia stock is selling for 37 times forward earnings. That's a small price to pay for such robust growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\n\n\nDanny Vena has positions in Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Nvidia.

Thanks to a well received quarterly earnings release, Nvidia stock cracked the $1000 per share mark for the first time. The AI chip winner\u2019s four-digit prices may not last. Luckily, there is no impending correction: Nvidia will split the stock 10-for-1 next month.Pretty soon NVDA will be back at around the $100 per share mark. Better yet, although splits do nothing to make a stock\u2019s fundamentals better or worse, there are unrelated catalysts in play that could drive an additional move higher for shares between now and year\u2019s end.Nvidia Stock, its Recent Earnings Release, and an Upcoming Stock SplitOn May 22, Nvidia released its fiscal results for the fiscal quarter ending April 30,\u00a02024. For the quarter, year-over-year revenue growth for the AI chip designer came in at a staggering 262%. On a sequential, or quarter-over-over, basis, revenue moved up a steady 18%.GAAP earnings per share came in at $5.98, an increase of 629% compared to the prior year\u2019s quarter, and up 21% on a sequential basis. Alongside yet another quarter of consensus-beating results, management made some other promising announcements.For instance, revisions to revenue guidance for the current quarter ($28 billion) came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, which prior to earnings were calling for $26.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Nvidia also announced that it was raising its quarterly dividend by 150%. With this plethora of promising news, it\u2019s no surprise that, much as we anticipated, the skeptics were proven wrong.Results failed to fall short of perfection, sending Nvidia stock zooming well past the $1,000 per share mark after earnings. Again though, NVDA is above $1000 per share, but only temporarily. Nvidia announced the aforementioned 10-for-1 stock split alongside results and guidance, with the effective split scheduled for June 7.Two Reasons Why This Latest Rally has RunwayAs we mentioned above, stock splits have zero impact on fundamentals. However, while a split alone will not make Nvidia more or less valuable, there are two strong reasons the latest NVDA rally could carry on post-split.First, stock splits help to improve liquidity. While the impact of this on highly liquid mega cap Nvidia stock will be marginal, a share price in the low $100s will make it more accessible to retail investors and could provide somewhat of a boost.Second, and more importantly, there are substantive catalysts in motion that could justify additional moves higher for NVDA shares. Currently, the dominant name in AI chips, the company is poised to maintain its dominance. During this quarter and next quarter, high demand for Nvidia\u2019s existing product offerings points to further earnings beats. This could help drive a continued steady climb for NVDA, even if growth begins to slow down on a year-over-year basis.Two quarters from now, however, sales of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell series of AI accelerators will launch. Sales of these latest, greatest chip products will at point begin to have an impact on revenue and earnings. Blackwell\u2019s debut could even lead to growth reacceleration.The Verdict: With Another 50% Jump Within Reach, Stay Long and Strong With NVDASell-side consensus calls for Nvidia\u2019s earnings to more than double this fiscal year, rising by another 29.5% during the fiscal year ending January 2026.However, depending on the success of the Blackwell chips, and the extent in which Nvidia\u2019s sales to non-AI end user markets improve, analysts could soon make upward revisions to these forecasts.Consensus could even rise to where the top end of forecasts are today: $30.35 per share in FY 2025, $47.53 per share in FY 2026 earnings.Slap a low-30s multiple to the FY 2026 forecast, and the prospect of NVDA hitting a pre-split price of $1500, aka a post-split price of $150 per share, is not so far-fetched.With this high level of potential upside within reach, there\u2019s a clear verdict: stay long, and stay strong, with Nvidia stock.Nvidia stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.

Analysts are bullish, with a consensus price target of $949.36 a share. They maintain a consensus rating of \u201cBuy\u201d for Nvidia, with the most recent ratings citing a potential upside of 31.50% from the current price.However, observers of the stock on Reddit predict a drop to $800. They cite market trends and supply chain issues faced by other semiconductor companies as reasons for the bearish take.BenzingaChart: Benzinga ProPositive analyst sentiment is supported by Nvidia\u2019s strong technical indicators, including trading above its key moving averages (see chart above) and experiencing buying pressure, which are considered bullish signs.BenzingaChart: Benzinga ProThe oscillators are signalling bullishness. Nvidia stock\u2019s price has moved to upper (bullish) Bollinger Band from the lower (bearish) one.The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line, though a negative currently (-1.74), can be seen to have crossed over the signal line (viz. -3.65) \u2013 signalling potential change in market momentum towards being bullish.The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 51.77, has been resting in the Neutral territory (<30 and <70) for some time now- shying away from giving out any solid market signal.Also Read: Nvidia\u2019s Cloud Gaming Evolution: Streamline GeForce Now and Anticipate Xbox Support on Steam DeckReddit Users\u2019 Contrarian View Of NvidiaRedditors, such as user rayrayrex on r/wallstreetbets, are bearish on Nvidia\u2019s short-term prospects. \u201cNVDA will drop to 800,\u201d the Reddit user said.The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results.

This could lead to a bearish trend for Nvidia.The contrasting viewpoints on Nvidia highlight the complexity of stock market analysis. While analysts base their recommendations on fundamental and technical analysis, Reddit discussions reflect market sentiment and short-term speculation.

Markets eye bumper earnings.  Forward guidance will be key.  BoliviaInteligente / UnsplashRecent AI plays didn\u2019t do so well with Arm posting underwhelming guidance this week. Nvidia faces a high bar. Nvidia stock NVDA dropped nearly 2% on Thursday as investors reshuffled their AI plays, anticipating the chip maker\u2019s April-quarter earnings report coming May 22. Not a great performance so far from the AI-related stocks. Chip designer Arm ARM tanked 9% in pre-market Thursday but made up for it and wrapped up regular trading down 2.3%. Earlier this month, AI server maker Super Micro SMCI sank 14% on disappointing earnings.  Stakes are high for the AI heavyweight \u2014 Nvidia is up against Wall Street\u2019s lofty expectations for profit growth of 38% year-over-year. Revenue is expected to hit $22.1 billion, up 207% from last year\u2019s $7.19 billion. More importantly, perhaps, will be the chip giant\u2019s forward guidance. Investors are gearing up for a huge leap in revenue and earnings projections for the year ahead. Expected sales figures will provide clues into how big Big Tech is going to spend on building out the AI infrastructure, powered by Nvidia\u2019s monster chips.  Shares of Nvidia have staged a nice recovery from a short-lived dive near $750 a piece. Early on Friday, the stock is poised to open for trading at $888 per share, or about $60 away from the record high around $950 a pop. Nvidia has knocked it out of the park this year with roughly 85% share-price growth. Nvidia is the only one of the mighty Magnificent Seven club to report quarterly earnings this season.

But what if you already own enough Nvidia, or are simply looking for other opportunities? A good place to start is by looking at the companies that Nvidia partners with that indirectly benefit from its success. Three that stick out are Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), Vertiv Holdings (NYSE: VRT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Here's what makes each stock a great buy now.   Image source: Getty Images.   Micron is providing a key ingredient in Nvidia's new GPU Scott Levine (Micron Technology): Of the many Nvidia partners that have the potential to prosper from a relationship with the AI juggernaut, Micron is a company that should certainly be on growth investors' radars. A leader in memory and storage solutions, Micron benefited from the AI industry's rapid growth in 2023. Its new partnership with Nvidia suggests that the company is extremely well positioned for future growth as the AI market continues to soar.  In February, Micron announced that it had commenced large-scale production of its high capacity memory solution, the High Bandwidth Memory 3E (HBM3E), and it began deliveries of the product in the second quarter. Micron asserts that the HBM3E will help enable \"lightning-fast data access for AI accelerators, supercomputers, and data centers.\" Nvidia will use the HBM3E in its graphics processing card (GPU), the H200 Tensor Core GPU. It's not only an increase in performance that makes the HBM3E attractive -- it's also appealing from an economics perspective. Micron lauds the HBM3E as a more cost-effective option, as it uses 30% less power than similar products. According to Nvidia, the H200 Tensor Core GPU doubles the memory capacity of its previous product, the H100 Tensor Core GPU, and has 1.4 times the bandwidth. With this upgrade in performance, Nvidia is confident that the H200 Tensor Core GPU will further facilitate the development of generative AI and large language models. The relationship between Micron and Nvidia transcends the recently announced collaboration. In fiscal 2019, for example, Nvidia launched the GeForce RTX graphics card for the gaming market, which relied on Micron's memory chips. Vertiv stock still has upside potential Lee Samaha (Vertiv Holdings): The data center equipment provider's stock is on an incredible run. Up 549% over the last year and 103% in 2024 alone, investors must be wondering just how much longer the stock has to run, not least because it trades at 41 times estimated 2024 earnings.   Story Continues Yes, the valuation looks heady, but not if we are only in the very early innings of a multi-year investment cycle in data centers driven by AI-related investment. Vertiv's digital infrastructure technology (power management, thermal management, rack systems, etc.) is critical to the functioning of data centers, and it's a solution advisor or consultant partner in the Nvidia partner network.As such, it's a vital beneficiary of the boom in spending on AI, and the company's recent first-quarter earnings demonstrated the strength of the momentum in the trend. Its orders growth was up 60% from the first quarter of 2023, and its book-to-bill ratio was 1.5 times, implying significant revenue growth to come as the company executes on its $6.3 billion backlog.Wall Street has Vertiv's free cash flow growing at 22% and 25% in the years after 2024, and if AI spending trends continue, Vertiv should be able to grow into its valuation. If you are bullish on Nvidia, it makes sense to look at Vertiv, too.The linchpin of chip manufacturingDaniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor):  Taiwan Semi is a bet on sustained demand for chips for consumer electronics, the automotive industry, AI accelerators, and more. In 2023, the chip-making company commanded 61% of global chip-foundry activity.Nvidia, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and others rely on Taiwan Semi to take their proprietary designs and manufacture to extremely precise specifications. Not to put down construction or engineering contractors, but what Taiwan Semi is doing is some of the most complicated manufacturing in the world. Taiwan Semi's ability to fulfill complex orders is why companies around the world outsource their chip manufacturing to Taiwan.Investors may want to consider Taiwan Semi as a catch-all way to bet on the rising tides of AI, electrification, data centers, and the general need for more computing power. Taiwan Semi should benefit as long as overall demand is growing. It doesn't particularly care if AMD is taking market share from Nvidia or vice versa.Despite its advantages, Taiwan Semi does have some risks -- namely competition and the need to simplify supply chains and localize chip manufacturing to reduce geopolitical risk. The CHIPS Act in the U.S., for example, is keen on allocating billions to increase domestic chip production. Taiwan Semi has fabs in the U.S., but it is still primarily manufacturing chips in Asia.The tailwinds of AI are strong, but that doesn't mean that growth in the semiconductor industry is a straight line up. Apple, for example, is undergoing a slowdown driven by weak iPhone demand. Taiwan Semi's sales and earnings have flatlined recently as some of its core markets fall under pressure.  TSM Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts The good news is that analysts expect earnings to recover, with consensus estimates calling for $6.26 in 2024 earnings per share (EPS) and 2025 consensus estimates of $7.86. As a result, Taiwan Semi's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 22.7 compared to its current P/E of 27.2.Despite being down just 10% from its all-time high, Taiwan Semi is a great value and a balanced buy for investors with the patience to endure the industry's cyclicality. It also sports a 1.4% dividend yield as a cherry on top of the strong underlying investment thesis.Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Santa Clara, Calif., chip giant has pretty much become synonymous with the artificial intelligence revolution. Nvidia makes graphics-processing units, or GPUs, which play a crucial role in AI. The company's shares have tripled over the past year, giving it a market capitalization of $2.27 trillion.  Chief Executive Jensen Huang, who co-founded the company at a Denny's restaurant in San Jose in 1993, was named\u00a0to Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of 2024. Nvidia's next-generation AI chip, the R-series/R100, will reportedly enter into mass production in fourth-quarter 2025, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and will focus on improving power consumption and enhancing AI computing power.

Mitre, a federally funded not-for-profit research organization that has supplied U.S. soldiers and spies with exotic technical products since the 1950s, said the project could improve everything from Medicare to taxes. \u201cThere\u2019s huge opportunities for AI to make government more efficient,\u201d said Charles Clancy, senior vice president of Mitre. \u201cGovernment is inefficient, it\u2019s bureaucratic, it takes forever to get stuff done. \u2026 That\u2019s the grand vision, is how do we do everything from making Medicare sustainable to filing your taxes easier?\u201d he said.   Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive of Nvidia.I-HWA CHENG/Getty Images  Billionaire cuts his stake in Nvidia Nvidia shares took a hit earlier this week when the billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said that he'd slashed his big bet in the chipmaker earlier this year. He said the swift AI boom could be overdone in the short run. Related: Nvidia shares get boost from key supplier ahead of earnings \u201cWe did cut that and a lot of other positions in late March. I just need a break. We\u2019ve had a hell of a run. A lot of what we recognized has become recognized by the marketplace now,\u201d Druckenmiller said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d Druckenmiller said he reduced the bet after \u201cthe stock went from $150 to $900.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not Warren Buffett \u2014 I don\u2019t own things for 10 or 20 years. I wish I was Warren Buffett,\u201d he added.   Stanley Druckenmiller, chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office, during the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York on Wednesday, June 7, 2023. Photographer: Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg/Getty Images  The financier, who now runs Duquesne Family Office, said he was introduced to Nvidia in the fall of 2022 by his young partner, who believed that the excitement about blockchain was going to be far outweighed by AI.   Story Continues \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how to spell it,\u201d Druckenmiller said. \u201cI bought it. Then a month later, ChatGPT happened. Even an old guy like me could figure out, okay, what that meant, so I increased the position substantially.\u201dHe added that AI \"might be a little overhyped now but underhyped long term.\u201d\u201cAI could rhyme with the internet,\" he said. \"As we go through all this capital spending, we need to do the payoff while it\u2019s incrementally coming in by the day. The big payoff might be four to five years from now.\u201dAnalyst affirms Nvidia on Conviction ListTheStreet Pro's Stephen Guilfoyle has similar feelings about Nvidia, noting that the company \"has rallied into its upcoming quarterly earnings release, and the stock price climbs closer to those levels seen a couple of months ago.\"He said that \"it was reaffirming for me as a trader/investor that someone I think of as possibly the industry GOAT was thinking along the same lines ... protecting profits near highs going into what seemed like a rough patch. ... I remain long the name, and the name remains for me a top 10 holding.\"Nvidia is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on May 22. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the company to report a profit of $5.60 a share on revenue of $24.75 billion.More AI Stocks:Analyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle deal Veteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stock Analysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reports A year earlier Nvidia posted earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $7.19 billion.On Feb. 21, Nvidia beat Wall Street's fiscal fourth-quarter targets, delivering its third quarter of triple-digit percentage growth in sales and earnings.Analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the firm's price target on Nvidia to $1,100 from $1,000 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares, which remain on the firm's Conviction List.The firm increased its 2025-2027 non-GAAP earnings-per-share estimates by an average of 8% to reflect intra-quarter industry data points indicating continued robust AI server demand and improving supply.Related: Analysts adjust Amazon stock price target after earningsNvidia stock still trades at a relatively attractive valuation compared with its peers, given how quickly it is growing and how durable those growth trends look in the coming years, Goldman Sachs said. (The current price-to-earnings multiple on NVDA is 75.)Despite the stock's year-to-date outperformance, Goldman said that it saw positive earnings-per-share revisions driving another leg up in the stock, the analyst tells investors.The investment firm said it was specifically encouraged by recent comments from the megacap tech giants, which suggested on their earnings calls that they would be spending even more money on AI infrastructure in 2025, following elevated investment in 2024.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

[+] bell right before trading halted on the New York Stock Exchange on March 9, 2020 in New York. - T (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images\nIt was another topsy-turvy week in the stock market as stronger-than-expected early economic reports again made investors fear that the Fed would not be able to cut rates. Traders were apprehensive as they waited for Wednesday's after the close earnings from NVIDIA\nNVIDIA\n\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust\n Corp. (NVDA) but they had nothing to fear as once again they beat on earnings and revenues.\n\n\nThe stock climbed well above the $1000 level to gain over 15% for the week as they also announced a 10-1 stock split that is scheduled for June 10th. This set the stage for a wild open on Thursday as buy orders flooded the market.\n\nAs I mentioned before Thursday\u2019s open \u201cIt will be interesting to see how the markets react to the NVDA news as I would be on the lookout for a possible negative reversal\u201d. As it turned out the S&P 500 opened higher at 5340.26 (line b) which was above the prior day\u2019s high, reached 5341.88 before closing at 5267.84 which was well below the prior day\u2019s low.\n\nS&P 500 Key ReversalTom Aspray - ViperReport.com\nI have discussed prior the key reversals on July 27, 2023, as well as on April 4th, 2024, line a. They are also referred to as bearish engulfing patterns but when I first learned about them candle charting was not widely used. Thursday\u2019s trading met all the psychological criteria. A strong market trend, a very bullish opening that was preceded by sharp overnight gains in the futures and then investor FOMO after NVDA\u2019s earnings.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nI frequently stress that one should carefully analyze the entry price of any new positions. One strategy I teach is to buy close to a rising 20-day EMA where a tighter stop can allow one to better limit the risk.\n\nOn Thursday, May 23rd NVDA opened at $1020.28 which was 12.2% above its 20-day EMA and also well above the daily starc+ band at $999.70. NVDA was clearly in a high-risk buy area. Though NVDA finished the week even higher it closed over $130 points above good support and a logical stop. This would be a potential risk of well over 12%.\n\n\nSo does the key reversal in the Spyder Trust (SPY\nPrincipal Shareholder Yield Index ETF\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n) mean we have to see a correction of 4% like what occurred after the April 4th reversal? Or should we be prepared for the double-digit decline that took place after the key reversal on July 27th, 2023? That correction lasted until the end of October 2023.Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)Tom Aspray - ViperReport.com\nOverall the technical warnings in July were stronger than the current situation as the A/D lines eventually generated stronger sell signals. For example, the Invesco QQQ\nInvesco QQQ Trust\n Trust (QQQ) did not close below Wednesday\u2019s low so it did not trigger a key reversal last week.\nThe 20-day EMA and initial chart support is now in the $443.33 area with the QPivot at $429.56. The recent breakout to new highs is bullish for the intermediate term. The weekly starc+ band is at $466.73 with QPivot resistance in the $473 area.\nThe daily Nasdq 100 Advance/Decline line had a new high last Monday overcoming the negative divergence at line b. The A/D line dropped back to its WMA on Thursday but then rose on Friday. A move above last week\u2019s high would be very positive.\nThe relative performance (RS)  has gotten stronger as it has moved further above the downtrend, line c, and its rising WMA. The weekly RS is positive as it is also above its WMA signalling that QQQ is again a market leader.Growth/ValueTom Aspray - ViperReport.com\nThis analysis is consistent with the readings from the IWF\niShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF\n/IWD ratio analysis. The downtrend from the February high, line b, was broken two weeks ago. This means that growth is now leading as the prior high at 1.936 has been overcome. The 20-week EMA has turned higher which also favors growth over value. It would now take a decline below the April low to change the outlook. The MACDS are rising and improving but are still negative.\nIt was a rough week for the markets as the Nasdaq 100 Index was the only one that was higher, up 1.4%. The S&P 500 was essentially flat. The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD\nSPDR Gold Shares\n) dropped 3.5% last week leading on the downside followed by 2.7% declines in both the Dow Jones Transportation and Dow Jones Utility Average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also lower, losing 2.3%.\nGiven the lower weekly closes a further pullback early this week would not be surprising, As long as there are not stronger sell signals from the A/D lines even a correction like April is not expected. The growth of ETFs and stocks will be favored as they are likely to be leaders this summer. Be sure to watch both your entry levels and risk.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Here\u2019s what our analyst thought of the results, which sent shares rising in pre-market trading.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Nvidia\n\nFair Value Estimate: $1,050\nMorningstar Rating: 3 stars\nEconomic Moat: Wide\nMorningstar Uncertainty Rating: Very High\n\n\u00a0\nNvidia expects the next quarter's revenue to be $28.0 billion, up 8% sequentially and 107% year on year, and ahead of FactSet consensus estimates of $26.6 billion. We anticipate Nvidia will once again beat these estimates.\u00a0We raise our fair value estimate to $1,050 from $910 as we model stronger data centre revenue growth over the next several quarters.\n\nWhat We Thought of Nvidia's Earnings\nWide-moat Nvidia (NVDA) once again reported stellar quarterly results and provided investors with even rosier expectations for the upcoming quarter, as the company remains the clear winner in the race to build out generative artificial intelligence capabilities. We\u2019re encouraged by management\u2019s commentary that demand for its upcoming Blackwell products should exceed supply into calendar 2025, and we see no signs of AI demand slowing either.\nWe raise our fair value estimate to $1,050 from $910 as we model stronger data centre revenue growth over the next several quarters while maintaining our longer-term growth rates from a higher installed base of AI equipment. Shares were up about 6% on the earnings report, and we think the reaction is justified and view shares as fairly valued.\nRevenue in the April quarter was $26.0 billion, up 18% sequentially as more supply for Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units came online. Revenue was up 262% year over year and ahead of guidance of $24.0 billion. Data centre revenue remains the focus, coming in at $22.6 billion (87% of total revenue), up 23% sequentially and 427% year on year. Demand continues from cloud computing leaders as they support their customers in building AI models, as well as from enterprises, consumer internet leaders like Meta Platforms META, and sovereign governments building AI into telecom and other services. Nvidia still wields exceptional pricing power, with an adjusted gross margin of up 220 basis points sequentially to 78.9%, ahead of guidance of 77%.\nNvidia expects July-quarter revenue to be $28.0 billion, up 8% sequentially and 107% year on year, and ahead of FactSet consensus estimates of $26.6 billion. We anticipate Nvidia will once again beat these estimates, and we model $29.7 billion of revenue. The firm has earned at least $3 billion of incremental data centre revenue in each of the past three quarters, driven by AI demand, and we anticipate that a fourth similar quarter is on the near-term horizon.\nNvidia\u2019s Stock Split Starts in June\nFor the July quarter, the adjusted gross margin is expected to fall to 75.5%, likely due to higher costs associated with the rollout of Blackwell products. Still, we think guidance for July implies a 62% adjusted operating margin, which is spectacular by any measure. On the financial and capital allocation front, Nvidia raised its dividend by 150% but still sits at a relatively immaterial $0.40 per share annually. The company will also conduct a 10-for-1 stock split at the start of trading on Monday, June 10.\nGiven Nvidia\u2019s astronomical growth, we continue to assess the risk of companies buying too many AI GPUs too soon, leading to an air pocket and excess inventory at some point in the future. We see no such signs today. Leading cloud companies have all boosted their capital expenditure plans in 2024 to support AI investments, and it still appears that this spending is being funneled to Nvidia. Beyond the mega-cap cloud leaders, enterprises also seem to be boosting capex for similar reasons. Even as new Blackwell products are rolling out, management is confident that it will still sell its generation of Hopper H100 and H200 products in the meantime.\nFor fiscal 2025 (which ends January 2025 and effectively pertains to calendar 2024), we raise our forecast for data centre revenue to nearly $111 billion, up from $101 billion previously, and up from $47 billion generated last year and only $15 billion two years ago. We anticipate that Nvidia will grow revenue in this segment by an incremental $3 billion or so per quarter through the fiscal year as its supply chain partners build out additional capacity to support Nvidia\u2019s roadmap. We previously assumed another strong year of growth in fiscal 2026. Still, management\u2019s insight into the Blackwell rollout gives us greater confidence that Nvidia will keep growing quarter by quarter in fiscal 2026 as well. We now model 41% revenue growth in data centre in fiscal 2026 to $156 billion.\nFor the most part, we model low-teens revenue growth in data centre each year after that, albeit off a higher base, as these initial AI buildouts are greater than we previously anticipated. Given Nvidia\u2019s stellar operating profits, any increase in revenue leads to an outsize boost to free cash flow (and, thus, our fair value estimate) in our valuation model. Along these lines, we maintain our Very High Uncertainty Rating for Nvidia, given the nascent and fast-moving nature of the AI market, plus the high operating margins associated with each incremental dollar of revenue, for better or worse.\n\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJiEUd EkiQp kDoEjAD RvOMyO uPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHClvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL W bpcDf V IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA Xdtc d DnfD Q YHY Ps SNqSa h hY TO vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDcA Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez uNJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj gpvAr l Z GJk Gi a wg ccspz sySm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nTo view this article, become a Morningstar Basic member.\nRegister For Free\n\nAlready a member?Log In.\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAGS\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information contained within is for educational and informational purposes ONLY.

It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst\u2019s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm\u2019s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock\u2019s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar\u2019s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company\u2019s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit hereThe Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar\u2019s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar\u2019s conviction in those products\u2019 investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they\u2019re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst\u2019s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

Many on Wall Street will have their eyes set on the chip-making giant since it was the leader of previous rallies seen in the market and may be a signal of what's to come going forward.  Moor Insights & Strategy Founder and CEO Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to give insight into the upcoming earnings and what investors should expect from its potential impacts on the market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC).   Moorhead believes Nvidia will outperform expectations: \"The company is going to clearly beat expectations on top line and EPS and will likely see a very positive guide. And I base a lot of this analysis on 2 or 3 core things, which is look at demand. Demand is off the rails. What's development risk? Somewhat low because Blackwell is very similar to the previous chip they had. And then there's manufacturing. There could be some risk in manufacturing from TSMC (TSM) and that would be the place to look.\" Related Videos      02:18  Chinese stocks in focus amid shift away from US exceptionalism   Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 hours ago       04:39  Tech drags market lower, but this isn't a dot-com bubble rerun   Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 hours ago       01:00  Mag 7 declines, Reddit, PepsiCo: Market Minute   Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 hours ago       03:04  Netflix is the clear winner of the streaming war: MoffettNathanson   Yahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago    For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

The tech giant posted adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 versus the Street's $5.65 estimate. Revenue of $26.04 billion was better than the Bloomberg consensus of $24.69 billion and up 262% from a year ago. Data center revenue rose 427% from a year ago to $22.6 billion, topping expectations of $21.13 billion.   Nvidia also announced a 10-for-1 stock split that will occur after the market close on June 7. The company is also raising its dividend from $0.04 to $0.10, which the company says is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. For the second quarter, Nvidia expects to report revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%, compared to the $26.6 billion estimate.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Equity investing content Specialistfor\u00a0Investor HubFollow AuthorMay 29, 2024, 10:00am EDTUpdated Dec 3, 2024, 01:07pm ESTShareSaveCommentFuture Publishing via Getty Images\nNvidia\u2019s (NVDA) stock is holding its ground above $1,000, after the artificial intelligence (AI) bellwether reported yet another blowout quarter, set the stage for record future performance with a solid second-quarter outlook and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Nvidia\u2019s blockbuster earnings report clearly signals that the AI spending boom shows no signs of abatement. Even as Nvidia continues its meteoric rise pushing the boundaries, the stock is not the sole beneficiary of the AI growth narrative. The entire AI stock universe is firing on all cylinders, outperforming the U.S. and global indexes by more than 30% since the start of 2023. Although the outsized rally reminds investors of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s (which burst in March 2000), the current valuations of AI leaders are far more reasonable and based on solid earnings growth expectations, unlike the stretched valuations and speculation-led investing frenzy that characterized the tech bubble era. On the other hand, is this truly the beginning of an AI-inspired \u201cnext industrial revolution\u201d as extolled by CEO Jensen Huang? The article examines for clues in Nvidia\u2019s first quarter earnings report.\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s Role In The AI Industry \nWith a $2.77 trillion valuation, Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the U.S. trailing Microsoft and Apple. Originally popular for its chips used in video games, NVDA exploded to prominence after a pivot to the data center business in the last few years and the emergence of ChatGPT, which highlighted the huge potential of generative AI.\n\nNvidia designs high-performance chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) or accelerators to run large computers that process data and power generative AI. While Nvidia has a near monopoly on AI chips with a market share exceeding 90%, its true competitive advantage stems from the proprietary CUDA software stack that has been optimized for wide ranging AP applications and workloads.\n\nCUDA\u2019s centrality to Nvidia cannot be overstated. For reference, AMD\u2019s flagship AI accelerators\u2013the Instinct MI300 lineup to accelerate AI in the data center market is pitted directly against Nvidia\u2019s H100 and H200 GPUs. Reportedly, an Instinct MI300X GPU sells for approximately $15,000, while Nvidia\u2019s H100 AI GPUs cost between $30,000 and $40,000. However, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are still in overwhelming demand because of CUDA. AMD is taking aim at NVDA\u2019s dominance, by leveraging its open-source ROCm framework that competes directly with the de-facto CUDA standard. But NVIDIA\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust\n is fighting back with its relentless innovation that makes it difficult for developers to migrate away from CUDA.\n\nIntel is playing catchup with its new Gaudi 3 chip, which will compete with Nvidia's prior generation H100 processor. Intel claims that the new Gaudi 3 accelerator delivers \"50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency\" vs. Nvidia\u2019s H100 at \"a fraction of the cost.\u201d The company\u2019s large customers Meta, Microsoft and Google also have their own in-house AI chips.\nEven as the battle for AI chip supremacy heats up, dethroning Nvidia will be a herculean challenge for competition, which at best can position itself as a viable alternative and collectively claim 10% to 12% of market share.\n\nBearing testimony to this, Nvidia reported record first-quarter data center revenue of $22.6 billion (representing about 87% of total revenues), up 23% sequentially and up 427% year over year, thanks to continued strong demand for the Nvidia Hopper GPU computing platform, with large cloud providers (including Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Oracle) contributing mid-40s percentage of data center revenue. Other than large cloud providers, data center startups like CoreWeave, buy Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and rent these to customers on an hourly basis.\nProbably in a bid to neutralize the cost advantage touted by competition, Nvidia signaled solid returns on investment (ROI) of 5x to 7x for customers spending on Nvidia infrastructure. For every $1 spent on Nvidia AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years, the company said in its earnings conference call. The returns get even better with the company\u2019s recent H200 hardware\u2013an investment of $1 by an API provider in NVIDIA\u2019s HDX H200 powering Meta Platforms\u2019 Llama 3 AI Large Language model (LLM) can return $7 in revenues over the next four years.\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download Forbes' most popular report, 12 Stocks To Buy Now.\nNvidia\u2019s Recent Earnings Report \nProfit: Net income for the quarter was $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share, vs. year-ago $2.04 billion, or 82 cents. Adjusted earnings of $6.12 per share topped the $5.59 per share consensus. Nvidia beat EPS estimates in the last four quarters.\nRevenue: Nvidia posted record first-quarter revenue of $26 billion, up 18% sequentially and up 262% year over year, and well above its guidance of $24 billion and ahead of the consensus estimate of $24.65 billion. Nvidia has topped revenue estimates in the last four quarters. For the second quarter, Nvidia targets a new all-time high revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts expect $26.6 billion in sales.\nKey Takeaways From Nvidia\u2019s Earnings Call\nNo demand slowdown on Blackwell transition\nNvidia deflated concerns of any demand slowdown as it transitions from its current Hopper AI platform to the more advanced next generation Blackwell system. Blackwell has an inference capability that is 30x of Hopper\u2019s, while consuming 25x less cost and energy. So, the analysts were worried if customers would hold off on Hopper orders because of the upcoming Blackwell launch. However, Nvidia said it witnessed increasing demand for Hopper through the quarter (which is after it announced Blackwell) and expects demand to outstrip supply for some time as the transition happens. Besides, Blackwell systems are designed to be backward-compatible, making the transition easy for customers. The demand for both Hopper and Blackwell platforms is well ahead of supply and expected to continue well into the next year.\nBlackwell To Bring In More Growth\nThe Blackwell platform is in full production with shipments slated to begin in the second quarter, and ramp in the third quarter with data centers standing up for customers in the fourth quarter. Nvidia expects to see a lot of Blackwell revenues this year.\nCustomers Should \u201cPerformance Average\u201d As Nvidia Accelerates To A New \u201cOne-Year Rhythm\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that there is another chip in the cards after Blackwell and Nvidia is on a new \u201cone-year rhythm\u201d to release new chip architecture, which marks a significant acceleration from its two-year cycle.\nHuang signaled that staying ahead in the AI race was a strategic imperative rather than aiming for merely incremental improvements. He stated, \u201cdo you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important.\u201d\nIn a question to how customers who have spent billions of dollars on existing products would respond to the evolving landscape of newer offerings that quickly surpass the capabilities of existing ones and outpace the rate at which the value of the existing products depreciates, Huang suggested that performance-averaging will be the smart way for businesses to deal with \u201ca whole bunch of chips coming at them\u201d when making and saving money are immediate priorities and time is of essence.\nIs Nvidia\u2019s Stock A Buy Ahead Of Its 10-For-1 Stock Split?\nNvidia\u2019s 10-for-1 stock split would render its shares more accessible to a broader investor community, including the company\u2019s employees. Shareholders of Nvidia\u2019s common stock as of the close of market on June 6, will receive nine additional shares for each share owned. The additional shares will be distributed after the close of market on June 7 and trading will commence on a split-adjusted basis at market open on June 10.\nWith the stock split, NVDA may be targeting an inclusion in the prestigious Dow 30 index, following Amazon\u2019s lead. The Dow 30 index is price-weighted, meaning stocks with higher prices have a greater influence on the index. So, the Dow 30 does not typically include very high-priced stocks, as price changes in these stocks could skew the index and render it a less reliable gauge of overall market performance.\nThe AI leader also raised its dividend by 150% to 10 cents from 4 cents. The new dividend of $0.01 on a post-split basis will be paid on June 28 to all shareholders of record on June 11. Nvidia stock goes ex-dividend on June 10 when it commences its split-adjusted trading. So, the possibility of a stock rally until the ex-dividend date is likely. A stock split only changes the stock price and the share count, but does not affect the total value of the investor\u2019s holdings. So, for investors interested in the dividend and the Nvidia growth story, NVDA offers a buying opportunity ahead of the stock split.\nAnalysts And Market Reaction To Earnings\nOverall, the median price target for Nvidia on Wall Street rose around $150 to $1,250, after Nvidia posted stellar first-quarter earnings.\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse, who rates the Nvidia stock at \u201coverweight,\u201d raised his price target on the stock by $200 to $1,400, based on Blackwell being on track for revenues in the second half and the clear line of sight for sequential revenue growth through the October/January quarters.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, affirmed his buy rating on Nvidia and raised the price target from $1,000 to $1,160, citing the company\u2019s strong growth even through product transition. He noted that Nvidia was the clearest way to get exposure to the AI sector.\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya, who has a Buy rating on Nvidia, raised the price target from $1,100 to $1,320. He noted that Nvidia generates more than 50 cents in free cash flow for every dollar in sales, allowing for potentially higher shareholder returns.\nStop chasing shadows in the market.

Generative AI will expand well beyond cloud service platforms to multiple multibillion-dollar verticals, including consumer Internet companies, and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers.\nWith the rise in global data flows, Sovereign AI is becoming a critical consideration for nations. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks to navigate the complex landscape of data privacy and security. Nations procure and operate Sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities\u2013or rely on local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use.\nNvidia expects its Sovereign AI revenue to approach the high single-digit billions this year, from nothing last year, by helping jumpstart the AI ambitions of nations across the world.\nThe company expects automotive to be its largest enterprise vertical within the data center segment this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. For the first quarter, Nvidia\u2019s automotive revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year over year. The sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in self-driving platforms.\nTesla\u2019s latest autonomous driving software FSD (full self-driving) system version 12 is powered by Nvidia\u2019s chips. As the FSD-12 technology uses video learning and generative AI to predict the path and drive the car, it needs to process huge amounts of video data. As part of this initiative, Nvidia supported Tesla's expansion of its FSD training AI cluster to 35,000 Hopper H100 GPUs.\nXiaomi\u2019s first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan is built on the Nvidia Drive Orin, which is the company\u2019s AI car computer for software-defined autonomous vehicle fleets. Nvidia Drive Thor, the successor to Orin, has already procured design wins with EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper and Neuro. Thor is slated for production in vehicles in 2025.\nStrong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference should propel data center growth. Training should continue to scale as AI models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Nvidia\u2019s Hopper platform continues to drive exemplary data center growth for the company. The incredible complexity of growing inference workloads, powered about 40% of Nvidia\u2019s data center revenues in the trailing four quarters.\nThe next generation Blackwell platform, which enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models, is in full production.\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia started shipping its new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution that enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, and should ramp to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\nNvidia Inference Microservices (NIM) is the new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs.\nWith all the advantages mentioned above, Nvidia seems poised for the next wave of AI growth.\nInvestor Sentiment Towards AI\nInvestor sentiment appears positive towards Nvidia, AI and AI-related stocks. In the past month, NVDA shares have gained about 32% and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (exchange traded fund) that tracks the performance of the Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Index, by using full replication technique, is up slightly more than 6%. It should be noted that the Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Index, which holds 85 AI-related stocks, outperformed both the S&P 500 and the MSCI World indexes (designed to track broad global equity-market performance) by more than 30% since the beginning of 2023.\nBeyond Nvidia, What's Next In AI Investing?\nGoldman Sachs says that investors are already looking beyond Nvidia, at IT services and software stocks that build generative AI advancements into their product offerings. The next phase of growth should come from AI infrastructure companies, positioned to benefit from the buildout of AI-related infrastructure. This includes semiconductor companies, cloud providers, computer/network equipment makers, data center real estate investment trusts (REITs), utilities, and cyber security providers.\nOverall AI Challenges Ahead\nLess availability or lack of high-quality data to train an AI model, and the high cost of developing and implementing AI solutions appear to be major roadblocks for AI. For Nvidia particularly, its major clients turning into competitors poses the biggest challenge besides the high price of its GPUs vs. competition.\nBottom Line\nNvidia appears well poised to ride the next wave of AI growth with relentless product innovation and new business verticals. Investors interested in Nvidia\u2019s dividend can consider buying shares before the stock splits. As to what\u2019s next in AI investing, a good watch point would be AI infrastructure companies, positioned to benefit from the buildout of AI-related infrastructure. This includes semiconductor companies, cloud providers, computer/network equipment makers, data center real estate investment trusts (REITs), utilities, and cyber security providers. Any slowdown in demand for its AI chips or a drop in AI spending by the big tech will be red flags to watch out for in NVIDIA\u2019s future earnings reports.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)How does Nvidia\u2019s performance impact the AI industry?\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s performance is widely interpreted as the barometer of the nascent AI economy,\u00a0as the computing paradigm shifts from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding AI models.What key factors should investors consider regarding Nvidia\u2019s earnings reports?Investors should look for clues of any slowdown in AI spending by the large-cap technology sector that drives more than 40% of\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s data center revenues.

Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\n\n\nKey Background\nHigh volatility for Nvidia\u2019s stock was expected, as options trading priced in a roughly 8% move in either direction after earnings. Nvidia, which designs a majority of the semiconductor chips powering generative AI technology, has arguably been the biggest winner of the AI boom over the last two years, with the likes of Amazon and Microsoft among its top customers. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of about $2.3 trillion, a far cry from its sub-$400 billion market value at the end of 2022. Though a slowdown from the fairly unprecedented financial growth Nvidia experienced in recent quarters, analysts expect Nvidia to continue to grow at a strong pace, with consensus estimates projecting Nvidia\u2019s revenues to expand by about 90% in its fiscal year ending in Jan. 2025, with the $112 billion in forecasted sales more than four times higher than the 2022-23 fiscal year\u2019s $27 billion.\nTangent\nNvidia has almost single-handedly lifted the American stock market from its 2022 doldrums to today\u2019s record levels. Its 490% total return over the last 18 months is far better than the average S&P 500 stock\u2019s 13% return over the period, with the S&P up over 36% during that stretch. Even after Nvidia\u2019s valuation exploded, there aren\u2019t many on Wall Street who find Nvidia overvalued, as not one analyst tracked by FactSet has a sell rating on the stock, with the average price target of $1,039 per share pricing in about 10% upside from Wednesday\u2019s closing price.\n\nSurprising Fact\nNvidia\u2019s rise to become a $2 trillion company came as its once bread-and-butter video game business fell into a rut. Sales for Nvidia\u2019s gaming unit are about 25% lower than they were two years ago, accounting for just a tenth of overall revenues last quarter, a far cry from the over 40% gaming revenue mix Nvidia had for each of 2020 to 2022\u2019s first calendar quarters. In short, Nvidia has largely shifted its focus away from cheaper direct-to-consumer graphics processing units (GPUs) often coveted by gamers and instead redirected attention toward supplying AI-focused GPUs to big-ticket corporate clients.\n\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

Meet the startups vying for its crown A new generation of AI chips is on the wayIllustration: Harry Haysom May 19th 2024Share\u201cHE WHO controls the GPUs, controls the universe.\u201d This spin on a famous line from \u201cDune\u201d, a science-fiction classic, is commonly heard these days. Access to GPUs, and in particular those made by Nvidia, the leading supplier, is vital for any company that wants to be taken seriously in artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts talk of companies being \u201cGPU-rich\u201d or \u201cGPU-poor\u201d, depending on how many of the chips they have. Tech bosses boast of their giant stockpiles. Nvidia\u2019s dominance has pushed its market value above $2trn. On May 22nd it reported that its sales for the quarter ending in April grew by 262%, year on year (see chart).Explore moreArtificial intelligenceOpenAIThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline \u201cThink different\u201dBusinessMay 25th 2024\u2192Can Nvidia be dethroned?

Collaborates with NVIDIA to Redefine Cybersecurity for the Generative AI Era\n\nMay 14, 2024\n|\n\n                Daniel Bernard\n|\nExecutive Viewpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour business is in a race against modern adversaries \u2014 and legacy approaches to security simply do not work in blocking their evolving attacks. Fragmented point products are too slow and complex to deliver the threat detection and prevention capabilities required to stop today\u2019s adversaries \u2014 whose breakout time is now measured in minutes \u2014 with precision and speed.\nAs technologies change, threat actors are constantly refining their techniques to exploit them. CrowdStrike is committed to driving innovation for our customers, with a relentless focus on building and delivering advanced technologies to help organizations defend against faster and more sophisticated threats.\nCrowdStrike is collaborating with NVIDIA in this mission to accelerate the use of state-of-the-art analytics and AI in cybersecurity to help security teams combat modern cyberattacks, including AI-powered threats. The combined power of the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae XDR platform and NVIDIA\u2019s cutting-edge computing and generative AI software, including NVIDIA NIM, delivers the future of cybersecurity with community-wide, AI-assisted protection with the organizational speed and automation required to stop breaches.\n\u201cCybersecurity is a data problem; and AI is a data solution,\u201d said Bartley Richardson, NVIDIA\u2019s Director of Cybersecurity Engineering and AI Infrastructure. \u201cTogether, NVIDIA and CrowdStrike are helping enterprises deliver security for the generative AI era.\u201d\nAI: The Great Equalizer\nAdvancements in generative AI present a double-edged sword in the realm of cybersecurity. AI-powered technologies create an opportunity for adversaries to develop and streamline their attacks, and become faster and stealthier in doing so.\nHaving said that, AI is the great equalizer for security teams. This collaboration between AI leaders empowers organizations to stay one step ahead of adversaries with advanced threat detection and response capabilities. By coupling the power of CrowdStrike\u2019s petabyte-scale security data with NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing infrastructure and software, including new NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, organizations are empowered with custom and secure generative AI model creation to protect today\u2019s businesses.\n\nFigure 1. Use Case: Detect anomalous IPs with Falcon data in Morpheus\nDriving Security with AI: Combating the Data Problem\nCrowdStrike creates the richest and highest fidelity security telemetry, on the order of petabytes daily, from the AI-native Falcon platform. Embedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where cybersecurity\u2019s very best threat intelligence data is collected at the source, preventative and generative models are built and trained, and CrowdStrike customers are protected with community immunity. This collaboration helps Falcon users take advantage of AI-powered solutions to stop the breach, faster than ever.\n\nFigure 2. Training with Morpheus with easy-to-use Falcon Fusion workflow automation\nFigure 3. Query Falcon data logs for context-based decisions on potential ML solutions\n\u00a0\nJoint customers can meet and exceed necessary security requirements \u2014 all while increasing their adoption of AI technologies for business acceleration and value creation. With our integration, CrowdStrike can leverage NVIDIA accelerated computing, including the NVIDIA Morpheus cybersecurity AI framework and NVIDIA NIM, to bring custom LLM-powered applications to the enterprise for advanced threat detection. These AI-powered applications can process petabytes of logs to help meet customer needs such as:\nImproving threat hunting: Quickly and accurately detect anomalous behavior indicating potential threats, and search petabytes of logs within the Falcon platform to find and defend against threats.Identifying supply chain attacks: Detect supply chain attack patterns with AI models using high-fidelity security telemetry across cloud, identities and endpoints.Protecting against vulnerabilities: Identify high-risk CVEs in seconds to determine whether a software package includes vulnerable or exploitable components.\n\n\nFigure 4.

New AI foundation models and features drive technology news cycles. However, attention doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to cash or financial returns in those sectors just yet. OpenAI is raking in subscription fees from ChatGPT, and Microsoft is capturing revenue and new customers through its Azure OpenAI Service. However, when it comes to revenue and profit, no one is in the same league as NVIDIA. NVIDIA announced this week that its Q1 2025 revenue rose to $26.0 billion, up 18% from the previous quarter and 262% from Q1 2024. Data center revenue, which is predominantly driven by GPU sales for AI workloads, accounted for 89% of total revenue and was up 427% from the same quarter in 2024. Its net income was nearly $15 billion for the quarter. The quarterly revenue was only $974 million less than the full-year 2023 revenue. It\u2019s Not All Training AnymoreThe company estimates that about 40% of its data center revenue was driven by inference. This rise occurred despite the 3x improvement in inference speed, which translated into a comparable price reduction. Inference is scaling in terms of applications, model complexity, users, and queries per user. However, the data also means that three-fifths of data center revenue is still driven by training AI models. In Q1, NVIDIA worked with over 100 companies to build AI factories, including more than one that exceeded 100,000 GPUs. Automotive is expected to be the largest data center customer segment this year due largely to the rise in training for self-driving and other vision systems. Tesla expanded its NVIDIA cluster to 35,000 H100s in the quarter.Consumer internet is a strong growth driver, according to NVIDIA CFO Colette Kress. Llama 3 was trained on 24,000 H100s. Sovereign AI is also growing and is expected to reach the \u201chigh single-digit billions\u201d in revenue this year. Rising Developer AdoptionNVIDIA\u2019s secret strength goes beyond the hardware to developer adoption of its CUDA software. Total CUDA developers more than doubled over the past three years, rising from 2.5 to 5.1 million. Startups and GPU-based applications also more than doubled during the period. The Engine Behind Model AdvancesIt is hard to overstate NVIDIA\u2019s importance in the generative AI innovation curve. Accelerated computing and the voracious drive to reduce costs have made it possible for new and larger models to arrive in the market faster. This opens up access to new use cases for businesses and consumers and drives both technology trial and adoption. Since GPUs are a precursor material for generative AI model training, you can look at NVIDIA sales as a leading indicator of industry growth. That will continue to be the case until capacity exceeds demand. When you see NVIDIA sales begin to decline, it will be a sign that the capacity shortage is coming to an end, and AI model training and inference costs are likely to start falling.

Omniverse is a platform of application programming interfaces, software development kits and services that enable developers to easily integrate OpenUSD and NVIDIA RTX rendering technologies into existing software tools and simulation workflows.\nRealizing the Benefits of OpenUSD\nSoftServe and Continental\u2019s Industrial Co-Pilot brings together generative AI and immersive 3D visualization to help factory teams increase productivity during equipment and production line maintenance. With the copilot, engineers can oversee production lines and monitor the performance of individual stations or the shop floor.\nThey can also interact with the copilot to conduct root cause analysis and receive step-by-step work instructions and recommendations, leading to reduced documentation processes and improved maintenance procedures. It\u2019s expected that these advancements will contribute to increased productivity and a10% reduction in maintenance effort and downtime.\n\nIn a recent Omniverse community livestream, Benjamin Huber, who leads advanced automation and digitalization in the user experience business area at Continental, highlighted the significance of the company\u2019s collaboration with SoftServe and its adoption of Omniverse.\nThe Omniverse platform equips Continental and SoftServe developers with the tools needed to build a new era of AI-enabled industrial applications and services. And by breaking down data silos and fostering multi-platform cooperation with OpenUSD, SoftServe and Continental developers enable engineers to work seamlessly across disciplines and systems, driving efficiency and innovation throughout their processes.\n\u201cAny engineer, no matter what tool they\u2019re working with, can transform their data into OpenUSD and then interchange data from one discipline to another, and from one tool to another,\u201d said Huber.\nThis sentiment was echoed by Vasyl Boliuk, senior lead and test automation engineer at SoftServe, who shared how OpenUSD and Omniverse \u2014 along with other NVIDIA technologies like NVIDIA Riva, NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA NIM microservices \u2014 enabled SoftServe and Continental teams to develop custom large language models and connect them to new 3D workflows.\n\u201cOpenUSD allows us to add any attribute or any piece of metadata we want to our applications,\u201d he said.\nBoliuk, Huber and other SoftServe and Continental representatives joined the livestream to share more about the potential unlocked from these OpenUSD-powered solutions. Watch the replay:\n\nBy embracing cutting-edge technologies and fostering collaboration, SoftServe and Continental are helping reshape automotive manufacturing.\nGet Plugged Into the World of OpenUSD\nWatch SoftServe and Continental\u2019s on-demand NVIDIA GTC talks to learn more about their virtual factory solutions and experience developing on NVIDIA Omniverse with OpenUSD:\n\nTransforming Factory Planning and Manufacturing Operations Within Digital Mega Plants\nGetting Started With Generative AI and OpenUSD for Industrial Metaverse Applications\n\nLearn about the latest technologies driving the next industrial revolution by watching NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s COMPUTEX keynote on Sunday, June 2, at 7 p.m. Taiwan time.\nCheck out a new video series about how OpenUSD can improve 3D workflows.

These new features \u2014 along with all its other AI-powered effects \u2014 get a big boost from optimization for NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations.\nEditors use Blackmagic Design\u2019s DaVinci Resolve \u2014 one of the leading nonlinear video editing platforms \u2014 to bring their creative vision to life, incorporating visual effects (VFX), color correction, motion graphics and more to their high-resolution footage and audio clips.\nDaVinci Resolve\u2019s new AI tools accelerated by RTX unlock endless possibilities.\nResolve includes a large variety of built-in tools. Some are corrective in nature, letting editors match colors from two sets of footage, reframe footage after the fact or remove objects that weren\u2019t meant to be in a shot. Others give editors the power to manipulate footage and audio in new ways, including smooth slow-motion effects and footage upscaling.\nIn the past, many of these tools required significant time and effort from users to implement. Resolve now uses AI acceleration to speed up many of these workflows, leaving more time for users to focus on creativity rather than batch processing.\nEven better, the entire app is optimized for NVIDIA TensorRT deep learning inference software to get the best performance from GPU-reliant effects and other features, boosting performance by 2x.\nNew in Resolve 19\nThe newest release, DaVinci Resolve 19, adds two new AI features that make video editing more efficient: the IntelliTrack AI point tracker for object tracking, stabilization and audio panning, and UltraNR, which uses AI for spatial noise reduction.\nIntelliTrack AI makes it easy to stabilize footage during the editing process. It can also be used in Resolve\u2019s Fairlight tool to track on-screen subjects, and automatically generate audio panning within a scene by tracking people or objects as they move across 2D and 3D spaces. With AI audio panning to video, editors can quickly pan, or move audio across the stereo field, multiple actors in a scene, controlling their voice positions in the mix environment. All of this can be done by hand, but IntelliTrack\u2019s AI acceleration speeds up the entire process.\n\nUltraNR is an AI-accelerated denoise mode in Resolve\u2019s spatial noise reduction palette. Editors can use it to dramatically reduce digital noise \u2014 undesired fluctuations of color or luminance that obscure detail \u2014 from a frame while maintaining image clarity. They can also combine the tool with temporal noise reduction for even more effective denoising in images with motion, where fluctuations can be more noticeable.\n\nBoth IntelliTrack and UltraNR get a big boost when running on NVIDIA RTX PCs and workstations. TensorRT lets them run up to 3x faster on a GeForce GTX 4090 laptop vs. the Macbook Pro M3 Max.\nIn fact, all DaVinci Resolve AI effects are accelerated on RTX GPUs by NVIDIA TensorRT. The new Resolve update also includes GPU acceleration for Beauty, Edge Detect and Watercolor effects, doubling their performance on NVIDIA GPUs.\nFind out more about DaVinci Resolve 19, and try it yourself for free, at Blackmagic Design.\nLearn how AI is supercharging creativity, and how to get the most from your own creative process, with NVIDIA Studio.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

The company\u2019s value has surged by more than 450% since the AI race kicked off in late 2022. Nvidia, which controls some 80% of the global market for the computer chips needed to build powerful AI tools, is now the world\u2019s third-most-valuable company. CEO Jensen Huang, who steered Nvidia through its early days developing gaming hardware, has become an AI evangelist. Governments and companies alike, he argues, must invest in the chips required to build the new technology, or risk being left behind. As companies scrambled last year to obtain Nvidia\u2019s chips, Huang played kingmaker. He says he selected his customers \u201cfairly,\u201d to ensure no single entity could hoard the scarce resource. Despite competition, demand for Nvidia\u2019s products still outstrips supply, and it\u2019s showing no signs of slowing.More FromTIME100 Most Influential Companies 2024Inside Anthropic, the AI Company Betting That Safety Can Be a Winning StrategyBy Billy PerrigoBaiduBy Charlie CampbellSelena Gomez Talks Rare BeautyBy Lucy FeldmanHow the WNBA Set New Records with Caitlin Clark and Rookies Leading the ChargeBy Sean GregorySerum Institute of India's Plans for Its Game-Changing Malaria VaccineBy Astha RajvanshiMore Must-Reads from TIMEInside Elon Musk\u2019s War on WashingtonMeet the 2025 Women of the YearThe Harsh Truth About Disability InclusionWhy Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\u00a0Colman Domingo Leads With Radical LoveHow to Get Better at Doing Things AloneCecily Strong on Goober the ClownColumn: The Rise of America\u2019s BroligarchyWrite to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us\u00a9 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

As Wayve\u2019s core AI model advances, these products will enable manufacturers to efficiently upgrade cars to higher levels of driving automation, from L2+ assisted driving to L4 automated driving.\nAs part of its embodied AI development, Wayve launched GAIA-1, a generative AI model for autonomy that creates realistic driving videos using video, text and action inputs. It also launched LINGO-2, a driving model that links vision, language and action inputs to explain and determine driving behavior.\n\u201cOne of the neat things about generative AI is that it allows you to combine different modes of data seamlessly,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cYou can bring in the knowledge of all the texts, the general purpose reasoning and capabilities that we get from LLMs and apply that reasoning to driving \u2014 this is one of the more promising approaches that we know of to be able to get to true generalized autonomy and eventually L5 capabilities on the road.\u201d\n\n\nCategories: Driving | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Inception | NVIDIA DRIVE \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The researchers trained reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms on NVIDIA GPUs and used NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing and deploying advanced 3D applications and pipelines based on Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD), to enable photorealistic rendering.\nUsing the community-supported da Vinci Research Kit, provided by the Intuitive Foundation, a nonprofit supported by robotic surgery leader Intuitive Surgical, the ORBIT-Surgical research team demonstrated how training a digital twin in simulation transfers to a physical robot in a lab environment in the video below.\n\nORBIT-Surgical will be presented Thursday at ICRA, the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, taking place this week in Yokohama, Japan. The open-source code package is now available on GitHub.\nA Stitch in AI Saves Nine\nORBIT-Surgical is based on Isaac Lab, a modular framework for robot learning built on Isaac Sim. Isaac Lab includes support for various libraries for reinforcement learning and imitation learning, where AI agents are trained to mimic ground-truth expert examples.\nThe surgical framework enables developers to train robots like the da Vinci Research Kit robot, or dVRK, to manipulate both rigid and soft objects using reinforcement learning and imitation learning frameworks running on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.\nORBIT-Surgical introduces more than a dozen benchmark tasks for surgical training, including one-handed tasks such as picking up a piece of gauze, inserting a shunt into a blood vessel or lifting a suture needle to a specific position. It also includes two-handed tasks, like handing a needle from one arm to another, passing a threaded needle through a ring pole and reaching two arms to specific positions while avoiding obstacles.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Shunt-Insertion_Real-Sim.mp4\nOne of ORBIT-Surgical\u2019s benchmark tests is inserting a shunt \u2014 shown on left with a real-world robot and on right in simulation. \nBy developing a surgical simulator that takes advantage of GPU acceleration and parallelization, the team is able to boost robot learning speed by an order of magnitude compared to existing surgical frameworks. They found that the robot digital twin could be trained to complete tasks like inserting a shunt and lifting a suture needle in under two hours on a single NVIDIA RTX GPU.\nWith the visual realism enabled by rendering in Omniverse, ORBIT-Surgical also allows researchers to generate high-fidelity synthetic data, which could help train AI models for perception tasks such as segmenting surgical tools in real-world videos captured in the operating room.\nA proof of concept by the team showed that combining simulation and real data significantly improved the accuracy of an AI model to segment surgical needles from images \u2014 helping reduce the need for large, expensive real-world datasets for training such models.\nRead the paper behind ORBIT-Surgical, and learn more about NVIDIA-authored papers at ICRA.\n\n\nCategories: Deep Learning | Research | RoboticsTags: 3D | Artificial Intelligence | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Isaac | NVIDIA Research | Omniverse | Scientific Visualization | Simulation and Design | Social Impact | Synthetic Data Generation \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It\u2019s powering unscripted, dynamic NPCs, it\u2019s enabling creators to generate novel works of art, and it\u2019s helping gamers boost frame rates by up to 4x. But this is just the beginning.\nAs the capabilities and use cases for generative AI continue to grow, so does the demand for compute to support it.\nHybrid AI combines the onboard AI acceleration of NVIDIA RTX with scalable, cloud-based GPUs to effectively and efficiently meet the demands of AI workloads.\nHybrid AI, a Love Story\nWith growing AI adoption, app developers are looking for deployment options: AI running locally on RTX GPUs delivers high performance and low latency, and is always available \u2014 even when not connected to the internet. On the other hand, AI running in the cloud can run larger models and scale across many GPUs, serving multiple clients simultaneously. In many cases, a single application will use both.\nHybrid AI is a kind of matchmaker that harmonizes local PC and workstation compute with cloud scalability. It provides the flexibility to optimize AI workloads based on specific use cases, cost and performance. It helps developers ensure that AI tasks run where it makes the most sense for their specific applications.\nWhether the AI is running locally or in the cloud it gets accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA\u2019s AI stack, including TensorRT and TensorRT-LLM. That means less time staring at pinwheels of death and more opportunity to deliver cutting-edge, AI powered features to users.\nA range of NVIDIA tools and technologies support hybrid AI workflows for creators, gamers, and developers.\nDream in the Cloud, Bring to Life on RTX\nGenerative AI has demonstrated its ability to help artists ideate, prototype and brainstorm new creations. One such solution, the cloud-based Generative AI by iStock \u2014 powered by NVIDIA Edify \u2014 is a generative photography service that was built for and with artists, training only on licensed content and with compensation for artist contributors.\nGenerative AI by iStock goes beyond image generation, providing artists with extensive tools to explore styles, variations, modify parts of an image or expand the canvas. With all these tools, artists can ideate numerous times and still bring ideas to life quickly.\nOnce the creative concept is ready, artists can bring it back to their local systems. RTX-powered PCs and workstations offer artists AI acceleration in more than 125 of the top creative apps to realize the full vision \u2014 whether it\u2019s creating an amazing piece of artwork in Photoshop with local AI tools, animating the image with a parallax effect in DaVinci Resolve, or building a 3D scene with the reference image in Blender with ray tracing acceleration, and AI denoising in Optix.\nHybrid ACE Brings NPCs to Life\nHybrid AI is also enabling a new realm of interactive PC gaming with NVIDIA ACE, allowing game developers and digital creators to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars on RTX AI PCs.\n\nPowered by AI neural networks, NVIDIA ACE lets developers and designers create non-playable characters (NPCs) that can understand and respond to human player text and speech. It leverages AI models, including speech-to-text models to handle natural language spoken aloud,\u00a0to generate NPCs\u2019 responses in real time.\nA Hybrid Developer Tool That Runs Anywhere\nHybrid also helps developers build and tune new AI models. NVIDIA AI Workbench helps developers quickly create, test and customize pretrained generative AI models and LLMs on RTX GPUs. It offers streamlined access to popular repositories like Hugging Face, GitHub and NVIDIA NGC, along with a simplified user interface that enables data scientists and developers to easily reproduce, collaborate on and migrate projects.\n\nProjects can be easily scaled up when additional performance is needed \u2014 whether to the data center, a public cloud or NVIDIA DGX Cloud \u2014 and then brought back to local RTX systems on a PC or workstation for inference and light customization. Data scientists and developers can leverage pre-built Workbench projects to chat with documents using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), customize LLMs using fine-tuning, accelerate data science workloads with seamless CPU-to-GPU transitions and more.\nThe Hybrid RAG Workbench project provides a customizable RAG application that developers can run and adapt themselves. They can embed their documents locally and run inference either on a local RTX system, a cloud endpoint hosted on NVIDIA\u2019s API catalog or using NVIDIA NIM microservices. The project can be adapted to use various models, endpoints and containers, and provides the ability for developers to quantize models to run on their GPU of choice.\nNVIDIA GPUs power remarkable AI solutions locally on NVIDIA GeForce RTX PCs and RTX workstations and in the cloud. Creators, gamers and developers can get the best of both worlds with growing hybrid AI workflows.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

summary\n\nDell PowerEdge XE9680L server offers direct liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs for fast processing in a compact form factor\nDell delivers industry's densest and energy efficient turnkey rack-scale solutions to accelerate large Blackwell GPU deployments\nDell NativeEdge is the first edge orchestration platform that automates the delivery of NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, including NVIDIA NIM\nDell solutions and services with NVIDIA technology speed AI application deployment and digital assistant implementation\n\nFull story\nDell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) expands the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA to include new server, edge, workstation, solutions and services advancements that speed AI adoption and innovation.\n\"Organizations are moving quickly to capture the AI opportunity, which is why our collaboration with NVIDIA is so important,\" said Michael Dell, founder and CEO, Dell Technologies. \"Our expansion of the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA continues our joint mission \u2013 we're making it easy for organizations to implement AI so they can move boldly into this next technological revolution.\"\n\"Generative AI requires a new type of computing infrastructure \u2013 an AI factory that produces intelligence,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO, NVIDIA. \"Together, NVIDIA and Dell are providing the world's industries with a full-stack offering \u2013 including computing, networking and software \u2013 that drives the copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents and industrial digital twins of the digital enterprise.\"\nDell AI Factory with NVIDIA transforms data into insights and outcomes\nThe Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA integrates Dell's leading AI portfolio with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, underpinned by NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs, NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet networking fabric and NVIDIA Bluefield DPUs. Customers can purchase integrated capabilities tailored to their needs or pre-validated, full stack solutions to get them started on AI use cases that require accelerated performance like RAG, model training and inferencing. Advancements to the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA allow organizations to:\nUse advanced compute power to handle large scale AI deployments \n\nThe new\u00a0Dell PowerEdge XE9680L delivers high performance with support for eight NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs in a smaller 4U form factor. The server provides the highest possible rack-scale density for NVIDIA GPUs in an industry standard x86 rack, offering 33% more GPU density per node.1 The platform offers 20% more PCIe Gen. 5 slots and double the North/South network expansion capacity.2Direct liquid cooling (DLC) improves overall efficiency with greater cooling capacity for CPUs and GPUs. The PowerEdge XE9680L is designed for easy serviceability and will be available fully configured with advanced factory integration for rack-scale deployments and onsite installation.Dell is also announcing industry leading density and highly energy efficient turnkey rack-scale solutions that speed time to value for large GPU-accelerated deployments. Multiple variants will be available including an air-cooled design supporting 64 GPUs in a single rack, or a liquid cooled format featuring 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs in a single rack.\u00a0\n\nAccelerate edge AI application deployment with Dell NativeEdge and NVIDIA \n\nDell\u00a0NativeEdge is the first edge orchestration platform that automates the delivery of NVIDIA AI Enterprise software,3 helping developers and IT operators easily deploy AI applications and solutions at the edge. Businesses from manufacturers to retailers can quickly and accurately analyze their edge data with new Dell NativeEdge deployment blueprints which include NVIDIA Metropolis video analytics, NVIDIA Riva speech and translation capabilities and NVIDIA NIM inference microservices.\n\nSimplify\u00a0AI application development and deployment for faster time to value\n\nThe new Dell Generative AI Solution for Digital Assistants helps speed deployment of digital assistants that deliver a personalized self-service experience for end users on a full-stack Dell and NVIDIA solution. Implementation Services for Digital Assistants help organizations design, plan, implement, test and scale the solution.\nDell AI Factory with NVIDIA solutions help organizations quickly stand-up AI environments for a variety of use cases with full stack deployment automation engineered in collaboration with NVIDIA. Full stack automation reduces the time to value by up to 86% compared to doing it yourself.4 When combined with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, the overall time from delivery to running inferencing jobs is even further reduced. NIM microservices provide enterprise developers production-ready, optimized inference engines for popular AI models available from NVIDIA and its partner ecosystem.\nNew Dell Accelerator Services for RAG on Precision AI Workstations help shorten the AI development cycle and quickly yield better performing AI applications through a tailored large language model using RAG on a Dell Precision workstation with NVIDIA AI Workbench, a development platform to experiment, test, and prototype AI and ML projects in a more secure environment.\n\n\"Our research shows that organizations seek IT simplification, but are challenged to achieve it. AI, while promising simplification, brings its own set of complexities including choice, data quality, consistency and security. Having a proven, one-stop shop to help stand up the infrastructure, software and services needed to realize value from AI can reduce risk and lower costs,\" said Dave Vellante, chief analyst, theCUBE Research. \"Dell's end-to-end capabilities are a core differentiator that we believe will translate to AI. The Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA is a leading example of an AI solution designed to simplify adoption for emerging AI workloads.\"\nAvailability\n\nDell PowerEdge XE9680L servers will be available in the second half of 2024.\nDell NativeEdge deployment blueprints for NVIDIA will be available globally starting in the second half of 2024.\nDell Generative AI Solution for Digital Assistants and Implementation Services for Digital Assistants are available now in North America.\nDell AI Factory with NVIDIA automated deployment capabilities enabled through Dell professional services will be available in the second half of 2024.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n        \n\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNvidia is planning a new generation of AI-optimized chip technologies just two months after unveiling its Blackwell GPU family, the company said Wednesday during its Q1 2025 earnings call, for the three-month period ending April 28.\n\u201cI can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip, and we are on a one-year rhythm,\u201d Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang said. \u201cYou're going to see\u2026 new CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches [and] a mound of chips that are coming.\u201d\nThe chipmaker\u2019s revenues skyrocketed to $26 billion in the first quarter of its fiscal year, up 262% year over year. Hyperscaler demand helped drive data center revenue, Nvidia\u2019s largest reported segment, to $22.6 billion on the quarter, up 427% compared to a year ago. \u201cLarge cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp Nvidia AI infrastructure at scale,\u201d EVP and CFO Colette Kress said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nNvidia\u2019s fortunes rose steeply in the past year, buoyed by surging demand for AI processing power. As a key supplier of graphics processing units, the company occupies a pivotal position in the generative AI supply chain.\n\u201cThe demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible \u2014 we're racing every single day,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThe CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there.\u201d\nAs the company ramps up Blackwell production, Huang said there will be short-term supply constraints on the previous generation of chips.\n\u201cWe expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200,\u201d Huang said.\nMost enterprises aren\u2019t directly impacted by manufacturing shortfalls. But GPU consumption patterns tie back to enterprise customers along several major routes, through model builders, cloud service providers and device manufacturers. Nvidia hardware is embedded in every leg of that journey.\nConstructing large language models from the ground up devours massive amounts of compute resources for training and data. Kress reported that the first H200 Blackwell system was hand delivered to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by Huang to power the GPT-4o demos\u00a0earlier this month.\n\u201cOur production shipments will start in Q2, ramp in Q3 and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4,\u201d Kress said.\nWhile the three largest cloud providers \u2014 AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud \u2014 have each developed their own proprietary AI chip technologies, they are also jostling for access to the latest Nvidia products.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in every cloud,\u201d Huang said.\nHyperscaler business represents roughly 40% of Nvidia\u2019s data center revenue, according to Kress.\nGPU deployment is gaining additional momentum as enterprises cycle into device refresh mode.\nNvidia expanded its partnership with Microsoft\u00a0around AI PCs Tuesday. A new line of Copilot+ PCs optimized for LLM tools will be outfitted with Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, Microsoft said in an announcement.\nDell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung have also entered the race to embed GPU capabilities\u00a0in workstations.\n\u201cThe PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized,\u201d Huang said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nCloud, \nAI & Future Tech, \nHardware & Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

The library includes foundation models for drug discovery, medical imaging and genomics, backed by enterprise-grade security and support.\nNIM is now available via Amazon SageMaker \u2014 a fully managed service to prepare data and build, train and deploy machine learning models \u2014 and AWS ParallelCluster, an open-source tool to deploy and manage high performance computing clusters on AWS. NIMs can also be orchestrated using AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service for biological data analysis.\nEasy access to NIM will enable the thousands of healthcare and life sciences companies already using AWS to deploy generative AI more quickly, without the complexities of model development and packaging for production. It\u2019ll also help developers build workflows that combine AI models across different modalities, such as amino acid sequences, MRI images and plain-text patient health records.\nPresented today at the AWS Life Sciences Leader Symposium in Boston, this initiative extends the availability of NVIDIA Clara accelerated healthcare software and services on AWS \u2014 which include fast and easy-to-deploy NIMs from NVIDIA BioNeMo for drug discovery, NVIDIA MONAI for medical imaging workflows and NVIDIA Parabricks for accelerated genomics.\nPharma and Biotech Companies Adopt NVIDIA AI on AWS\nBioNeMo is a generative AI platform of foundation models, training frameworks, domain-specific data loaders and optimized training recipes\u200b that support the training and fine-tuning of biology and chemistry models on proprietary data.\u200b It\u2019s used by more than 100 organizations globally.\nAmgen, one of the world\u2019s leading biotechnology companies, has used the BioNeMo framework to train generative models for protein design, and is exploring the potential use of BioNeMo with AWS.\n\u200bBioNeMo models for protein structure prediction, generative chemistry and molecular docking prediction are available as NIM microservices, pretrained and optimized to run on any NVIDIA GPU or cluster of GPUs. These models can be combined to support a holistic, AI-accelerated drug discovery workflow.\nBiotechnology company A-Alpha Bio harnesses synthetic biology and AI to measure, predict and engineer protein-to-protein interactions. When its researchers moved from a generic version of the ESM-2 protein language model to a version optimized by NVIDIA running on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs on AWS, they immediately saw a speedup of more than 10x. This lets the team sample a much more extensive field of protein candidates than they would have otherwise.\nFor organizations that want to augment these models with their own experimental data, NIM enables developers to enhance a model with retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG \u2014 known as a lab-in-the-loop design.\nParabricks Enables Accelerated Genomics Pipelines\nNVIDIA NIM includes genomics models from NVIDIA Parabricks, which are also available on AWS HealthOmics as Ready2Run workflows that enable customers to deploy pre-built pipelines.\nLife sciences company Agilent used Parabricks genomics analysis tools running on NVIDIA GPU-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to significantly improve processing speeds for variant calling workflows on the company\u2019s cloud-native Alissa Reporter software. Integrating Parabricks with Alissa secondary analysis pipelines enables researchers to access rapid data analysis in a secure cloud environment.\u200b\nConversational AI Technology Supports Digital Health\nIn addition to models that can decode proteins and genomic sequences, NIM microservices offer optimized large language models for conversational AI and visual generative AI models for avatars and digital humans.\nAI-powered digital assistants can enhance healthcare by answering patient questions and supporting clinicians with logistics. Trained on healthcare organization-specific data using RAG, they could connect to relevant internal data sources to synthesize research, surface insights and improve productivity.\nGenerative AI startup Hippocratic AI is in the final stages of testing AI-powered healthcare agents that focus on a wide range of tasks including wellness coaching, preoperative outreach and post-discharge follow-up.\nThe company, which uses NVIDIA GPUs through AWS, is adopting NVIDIA NIM and NVIDIA ACE microservices to power a generative AI agent for digital health.\n\nThe team used NVIDIA Audio2Face facial animation technology, NVIDIA Riva automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, and more to power a healthcare assistant avatar\u2019s conversation.\nExperiment with NVIDIA NIMs for healthcare and get started with NVIDIA Clara on AWS.\nSubscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news. \n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Deep Learning | Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Genomics | Healthcare and Life Sciences | Inference | NVIDIA Clara | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | Science | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This intersection of security and AI is coming into focus with collaborations that companies like NVIDIA and its partners will describe at the event.\nData Science for a Data Problem\nMachine learning is a great tool for cybersecurity because data is exploding.\n\u201cWith more devices and users expanding the landscape to defend, cybersecurity has become a data problem; and AI is a data solution,\u201d said David Reber, NVIDIA\u2019s chief security officer.\nToday, security analysts can be overwhelmed by a data tsunami. Generative AI can provide security copilots that act like filters, extracting from the firehose flow of information the context and anomalies that need a human expert\u2019s attention.\nGenerative AI also lets security managers interrogate their data directly instead of setting rules, chasing alerts and tracking dashboards. In the age of AI, security experts will move from a command line to a conversational interface.\nAI Puts Security Context on Steroids\nThis shift takes context-based security to a new level, according to a talk Reber delivered at GTC.\nThe potential is huge, but it requires work to unearth it. At GTC, Reber encouraged cybersecurity experts to begin working with AI, starting with low-risk use cases to identify and secure gaps.\nHe also provided suggestions for how to go about securing machine learning processes, saying security experts need to:\n\nsecure data supply chains,\ndevelop tests for securing AI models and datasets across the development lifecycle,\nuse model cards, data cards and software bills of materials to provide AI transparency and reliability,\nparticipate in community testing events such as security hackathons, and\nupdate policies on how to respond to AI security events.\n\nFoundations for AI Cybersecurity\nTo give users a leg up, NVIDIA provides NVIDIA Morpheus, a cybersecurity AI framework that filters and classifies large volumes of real-time data. Morpheus, part of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, lets developers build applications that can detect spear phishing, insider threats and more.\nUsers can employ Morpheus with NVIDIA NIM and NeMo Retriever, microservices from the NVIDIA API Catalog for rapidly deploying AI. The combination can unlock new use cases, such as reducing from days to seconds the time to find and resolve common software vulnerabilities and exposures, one of many NVIDIA AI workflows.\nA new release of NVIDIA DOCA \u2014 the software framework for programming NVIDIA BlueField DPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX NICs \u2014 provides another foundation for AI security. It now sports updated encryption features for network and storage data.\nAn Expanding AI Security Ecosystem\nAt RSA, many companies will show products built on NVIDIA technologies that extend security for the generative AI era, including:\n\nAIC will demonstrate Qrypt\u2019s key generation for quantum secure encryption running on a BlueField DPU in an AIC-designed server.\nAnjuna will discuss how the U.S. Navy is evaluating confidential computing on the Anjuna Seaglass platform with proprietary LLMs running on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\nBloombase will show an updated version of its StoreSafe Storage Firewall powered by Morpheus and BlueField DPUs and will demonstrate new use cases for threat detection and fast, quantum-safe encryption of AI model and generative AI data.\nCheck Point Software will show its AI Cloud Protect security solution on BlueField DPUs, Quantum Force security gateways on ConnectX NICs, and Quantum Maestro software on NVIDIA Spectrum switches.\nCisco will feature Cisco Hypershield, an AI-native security architecture, to protect against both known and unknown attacks. It will also discuss its expanding partnership with NVIDIA to help customers harness the power of AI.\nCrowdStrike will show its CrowdStrike Falcon Foundry and CrowdStrike Falcon platform that employs NVIDIA\u2019s GPU-optimized AI software, including NIM microservices.\nDeloitte will showcase CyberSphere, a cyber operations platform that uses Morpheus to speed detection of cyber threats.\nPalo Alto Networks will describe its collaboration with NVIDIA on two use cases, a next-generation reference architecture for securing generative AI deployments with NIM and its VM-Series Virtual Next-Generation Firewall, with expanded intelligent traffic offload (ITO), supporting BlueField-3 DPUs.\nQrypt will demonstrate its quantum-secure key generation for securing AI workloads running on BlueField-3 DPUs using DOCA.\nSygnia will announce the use of BlueField DPUs and Morpheus in Velocity Edge, its new hardware-accelerated MXDR service for the energy and industrial sectors.\n\nThey are part of the NVIDIA ecosystem building a new layer of security for generative AI. That community includes more than 20 companies at RSA this week from NVIDIA Inception, a program for cutting-edge startups.\nAt RSA, Daniel Rohrer, vice president of software product security at NVIDIA, will be part of the keynote panel on AI safety.\nIn addition, Kevin Deierling, senior vice president of networking at NVIDIA, will share insights on security at the Cloudflare Executive Supper Club. And NVIDIA will participate in an event about women in cybersecurity.\nTo get started with AI-powered cybersecurity, try a workflow in NVIDIA LaunchPad.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Cybersecurity | Events | Inception | Machine Learning | NVIDIA BlueField | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

About 100 contestants vied for prizes from NVIDIA and Sparkfun by creating open-source projects to advance the use of AI in edge computing, robotics and IoT.\nNiewinski won first place in the generative AI applications category for his innovative robot based on the GLaDOS guide from game series Portal, the first-person puzzle platform from video game developer Valve.\nOther top winners included contestants Andrei Ciobanu and Allen Tao, who took first prize in the generative AI models for the edge and AI at the edge applications categories, respectively. Ciobanu used generative AI to help virtually try on clothes, while Tao developed a ROS-based robot to map the inside of a home to help find things.\nHarnessing LLMs for Robots\nNiewinski builds custom applications for robotics at his Armoury Labs business in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where he uses the NVIDIA Jetson platform for edge AI and robotics, creating open-source tutorials and YouTube videos following his experiences.\nHe built his interactive GLaDOS robot to create a personal assistant for himself in the lab. It handles queries using Transformer-based speech recognition, text-to-speech, and large language models (LLMs) running onboard an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, which interfaces with a robot arm and camera for interactions.\nGLaDOS can track his whereabouts in the lab, move in different directions to face him and respond quickly to queries.\n\u201cI like doing things with robots that people will look at and say it\u2019s not what they had immediately expected,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wanted the assistant to sound like the original GLaDOS from Portal and respond quickly. Fortunately, the gaming company Valve has put all of the voice lines from Portal and Portal 2 on its website, allowing Niewinski to download the audio to help train a model.\n\u201cUsing Jetson, your average question-and-answer stuff runs pretty quick for speech,\u201d he said.\nNiewinski used NVIDIA\u2019s open-source NeMo toolkit to fine-tune a voice for GLaDOS, training a spectrogram generator network called FastPitch and HiFiGAN vocoder network to refine the audio quality.\nBoth networks are deployed on Orin with NVIDIA Riva to enable speech recognition and synthesis that\u2019s been optimized to run at many times the real-time rate of speech, so that it can run alongside the LLM while maintaining a smooth, interactive delivery.\nFor generating realistic responses from GLaDOS, Niewinski uses a locally hosted LLM called OpenChat that he runs in Docker from jetson-containers, saying that it was a drop-in replacement for OpenAI\u2019s API. All of this AI is running on the Jetson module, using the latest open-source ML software stack built with CUDA and JetPack.\nTo enable GLaDOS to move, Niewinski developed the interactions for a Unitree Z1 robotic arm. It has a stereo camera and models for seeing and tracking a human speaking and a 3D-printed GLaDOS head and body shell around the arm.\nTrying on Generative AI for Fashion Fit\nWinner Ciobanu, based in Romania, aimed to improve the virtual clothing try-on experience with the help of generative AI, taking a top prize for his EdgeStyle: Fashion Preview at the Edge.\nHe used AI models such as YOLOv5, SAM and OpenPose to extract and refine data from images and videos. Then he used Stable Diffusion to generate the images, which he said was key to achieving accurate virtual try-ons.\nThis system taught the model how clothes fit different poses on people, which he said enhanced the realism of the try-ons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite handy as it allows users to see how clothes would look on them without actually trying them on,\u201d said Ciobanu.\n\nThe NVIDIA JetPack SDK provided all the tools needed to run AI models smoothly on the Jetson Orin, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super-helpful to have a stable set of tools, especially when you\u2019re dealing with AI tech that keeps changing,\u201d said Ciobanu. \u201cIt really cut down on the time and hassle for us developers, letting us focus more on the cool stuff we\u2019re building instead of getting stuck on tech issues.\u201d\n\u00a0Finding Lost Items With Robot Assistance\nWinner Tao, based in Ontario, Canada, created a robot to lessen the burden of searching for things lost around the house. His An Eye for an Item project took top honors at the Hackster challenge.\n\u201cFinding lost objects is a chore, and recent developments in zero-shot object detection and LLMs make it feasible for a computer to detect arbitrary objects for us based on textual or pictorial descriptions, presenting an opportunity for automation,\u201d said Tao.\n\nTao said he needed robot computing capabilities to catalog objects in any unstructured environment \u2014 whether a living room or large warehouse. And he needed it to also perform real-time calculations for localization to help with navigation, as well as running inference on larger object detection models.\n\u201cJetson Orin was a perfect fit, supporting all functionality from text and image queries into NanoDB, to real-time odometry feedback, including leveraging Isaac ROS\u2019 hardware-accelerated AprilTag detections for drift correction,\u201d he said.\nOther winners of the AI Innovation Challenge include:\n\nGeorge Profenza, Escalator people tracker, 2nd place, Generative AI Applications category\nDimiter Kendri, Cooking meals with a local AI assistant using Jetson AGX Orin, 3rd place, Generative AI Applications category\nVy Phan, ClearWaters Underwater Image Enhancement with Generative AI, 2nd place, Generative AI Models category\nHuy Mai, Realtime Language Segment Anything on Jetson Orin, 2nd place, Generative AI Models category\nFakhrur Razi, Autonomous Intelligent Robotic Shopping Cart, 2nd place, AI at the Edge Open category\nTeam Kinetika, Counting for Inspection and Quality Control with TensorRT, 3rd place, AI at the Edge Open category\n\nLearn more about NVIDIA Jetson Orin for robotics and edge AI applications.

The ability to do more work using less power is driving the construction of more Grace Hopper supercomputers around the world.\nAccelerating the Green Revolution in Supercomputing\nSuch achievements underscore NVIDIA\u2019s pivotal role in advancing the global agenda for sustainable high-performance computing over the past decade.\nAccelerated computing has proven to be the cornerstone of energy efficiency, with the majority of systems on the Green500 list \u2014 including 40 of the top 50 \u2014 now featuring this advanced technology.\nPioneered by NVIDIA, accelerated computing uses GPUs that optimize throughput \u2014 getting a lot done at once \u2014 to perform complex computations faster than systems based on CPUs alone.\nAnd the Grace Hopper architecture is proving to be a game-changer by enhancing computational speed and dramatically increasing energy efficiency across multiple platforms.\nFor example, the GH200 chip embedded within the Grace Hopper systems offers over 1,000x more energy efficiency on mixed precision and AI tasks than previous generations.\nRedefining Efficiency in Supercomputing\nThis capability is crucial for accelerating tasks that address complex scientific challenges, speeding up the work of researchers across various disciplines.\nNVIDIA\u2019s supercomputing technology excels in traditional benchmarks \u2014 and it\u2019s set new standards in energy efficiency.\nFor instance, the Alps system, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), is equipped with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200. An optimized subset of the system, dubbed preAlps, placed fifth on the latest Green500. CSCS also submitted the full system to the TOP500 list, recording 270 petaflops on the High-Performance Linpack benchmark, used for solving complex linear equations.\nThe Green500 rankings highlight platforms that provide highly efficient FP64 performance, which is crucial for accurate simulations used in scientific computing. This result underscores NVIDIA\u2019s commitment to powering supercomputers for tasks across a full range of capabilities.\nThis metric demonstrates substantial system performance, leading to its high ranking on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers. The high position on the Green500 list indicates that this scalable performance does not come at the cost of energy efficiency.\nSuch performance shows how the Grace Hopper architecture introduces a new era in processing technology, merging tightly coupled CPU and GPU functionalities to enhance not only performance but also significantly improve energy efficiency.\nThis advancement is supported by the incorporation of an optimized high-efficiency link that moves data between the CPU and GPU.\nNVIDIA\u2019s upcoming Blackwell platform is set to build on this by offering the computational power of the Titan supercomputer launched 10 years ago \u2014 a $100 million system the size of a tennis court \u2014 yet be efficient enough to be powered by a wall socket just like a typical home appliance.\nIn short, over the past decade, NVIDIA innovations have enhanced the accessibility and sustainability of high-performance computing, making scientific breakthroughs faster, cheaper and greener.\nA Future Defined by Sustainable Innovation\nAs NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in high-performance computing, it remains committed to enhancing the energy efficiency of global computing infrastructure.\nThe success of the Grace Hopper supercomputers in the Green500 rankings highlights NVIDIA\u2019s leadership and its commitment to more sustainable global computing.\nExplore how NVIDIA\u2019s pioneering role in green computing is advancing scientific research, as well as shaping a more sustainable future worldwide.\nFeature image: Jupiter system at J\u00fclich supercomputer center, courtesy of Eviden.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | SupercomputingTags: High-Performance Computing | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The AI customer service avatar comes to the rescue \u2013\u00a0 swiftly diagnoses the problem, offers an option for a faster internet connection, confirms the customer\u2019s credit card number and upgrades their internet connection immediately.\nThe futuristic demonstration took place in front of thousands of conference attendees who were eager to learn about the latest enterprise generative AI technology advancements, which promise to empower workers across the globe.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve transitioned from instruction-driven computer coding, which very few people can do, to intention-driven computing, which is connecting with somebody through intention,\u201d Huang said during an on-stage conversation at the conference with ServiceNow Chief Operating Officer Chirantan \u201cCJ\u201d Desai.\nThe moment is another compelling example of the ongoing collaboration between ServiceNow and NVIDIA to explore more engaging, personal service experiences across various functions, including IT services, human resources, customer support and more.\nThe demonstration builds upon the companies\u2019 plan to collaborate on robust, generative AI capabilities within enterprise operations and incorporates NVIDIA ACE and NVIDIA NIM microservices.\nThese avatars are designed to add a human-like touch to digital interactions, improving customer experience by providing empathetic and efficient support.\nThese include NVIDIA Riva for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech, NVIDIA Audio2Face for facial animation, and NVIDIA Omniverse Renderer for high-quality visual output.\nServiceNow and NVIDIA are further exploring the use of AI avatars to provide another communication option for users who prefer visual interactions.\n\u00a0\nVisit this link to watch a recording of Huang and Desai presenting the digital avatar demo at the Knowledge 24 keynote.\u00a0\n###END###\n\n\nCategories: Generative AI | SoftwareTags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA AI Enterprise | NVIDIA NIM \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unleash your champion in pursuit of a legacy-defining F1\u00ae Career, the mode\u2019s first major update since 2016. Drive like the greatest and feel at one with the car through the all-new EA SPORTS Dynamic Handling System, and experience the best F1\u00ae racing to date thanks to all of the game\u2019s new additions and enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1\u00ae 24 is available from today, May 28th, for players of the digital-exclusive Champions Edition and EA Play Pro subscribers, with the general release following on May 31st. When GeForce RTX gamers take to the track, they\u2019ll discover day-one support for a massive range of experience-enhancing technology, including DLSS, DLAA and Reflex.\nDLSS enables all GeForce RTX users to accelerate frame rates, while DLAA allows gamers with high-performing systems to use a native resolution image to maximize image quality.\nNVIDIA Reflex is a game-changing technology that reduces system latency on GeForce graphics cards and laptops so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer races, and making single-player races more responsive and enjoyable.\nAdditionally, GeForce RTX gamers can leverage the power of their GPU\u2019s dedicated Ray Tracing Cores to get the highest possible frame rates when activating F1\u00ae 24\u2019s ray-traced effects. Ray-Traced Reflections enhance the realism and fidelity of cars, glass, water and other suitably reflective surfaces. Ray-Traced Shadows enable every winglet and flourish on an F1\u00ae car to be accurately shadowed and self-shadowed, further heightening realism and immersion. And the new Ray-Traced Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination setting takes trackside lighting to the next level, and enhances the quality of ray-traced reflections and shadows.\nActivating all three ray-traced effects tests the mettle of any system, but with DLSS you can race with both excellent frame rates and incredible image quality. On GeForce RTX 40 Series desktop graphics cards, enabling DLSS 3 multiples frame rates by an average of 2X at 4K, with every ray-traced effect and other option maxed out. That enables owners of the GeForce RTX 4070, and faster cards, to play F1\u00ae 24 at its very best. And for owners of the fastest cards, they can enjoy super fast, super smooth 120 frames per second-plus racing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440 and 1920x1080, a 1.8X average improvement ensures all GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can experience F1\u00ae 24 in all its maxed out glory, at frame rates up to and over 200 FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops, a 1.8X average boost enables 70 FPS+ gameplay on the GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU, with every setting maxed out. Faster laptops rapidly race up the grid, surpassing 120 FPS, ultimately crossing the finish line at 170 FPS on the GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 2560x1440, a 1.7X average improvement enables GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU owners to play at over 70 FPS, and on faster Laptop GPUs, performance exceeds 120 frames per second, for a fantastic mobile gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty Season 4 Begins May 29th: Optimize Your Experience With DLSS & Reflex\nGet gassed up for Call of Duty\u00ae: Modern Warfare III\u2122 and Call of Duty\u00ae: Warzone\u2122 fourth season, featuring three brand-new Core 6v6 maps, an Unstable Rift to explore in Modern Warfare Zombies, and an Urzikstan mystery to solve before a potentially explosive countdown Event. Expect a host of new Warzone features, iconic new weapons, more Aftermarket Parts, new Operators, and more! Stop the threat and see what you\u2019re made of on May 29th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Call of Duty\u00ae: Warzone\u2122, NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency by up to 28%. Combined with super fast performance of up to 375 FPS delivered by DLSS, you can let your skill shine wherever you and your squad drop in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a competitive player who wants to remove all impediments to your performance, a GeForce RTX 40 Series PC and a G-SYNC monitor should be your next upgrade. Frame rates are now so high they can max out the fastest G-SYNC displays, delivering unparalleled motion clarity. And with minimal system latency and maximum peeker\u2019s advantage, you\u2019ll have a slight edge on laggier competitors, potentially making all the difference in a final-circle battle.\nLearn more about upgrading your setup with Reflex-compatible components and accessories here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapes Launches May 29th With DLSS 2 & DLAA\nTwenty years ago, the supervillains won. Since then, they\u2019ve created a dystopian city where developing super powers is a crime. Nobody has managed to slow them down, until now. Spitfire Interactive and Daedalic Entertainment's Capes is a turn-based superhero strategy game where you build a team of heroes and fight to take back the city.\nPlay across a series of campaign and patrol missions, choose to push forward with the story or take the time to explore the side missions and unlock more heroes, earn skill points and complete challenges, and learn more about your heroes lives during your quest to liberate the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Capes flies onto Steam tomorrow, GeForce RTX gamers can activate DLSS 2 to accelerate performance, or DLAA to take visuals to the highest possible level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeceive Inc. Season 4 Lands Today\nDeceive Inc., the unique multiplayer FPS blending stealth and spycraft released last year to critical acclaim with day-0 support for DLSS 2, maximizing performance. Available today, Season 4\u2019s World\u2019s Finest content update takes agents into a tale of epic proportions as the world of superheroes is rocked by an unexpected return and an uncertain future. \u00a0\nThe World\u2019s Finest update also introduces veteran spy Vigil, a cunning professional who literally wrote the book when it comes to these operations, alongside fittingly superhero-themed cosmetics for players to earn in Seasonal Catalog 4, and a range of gameplay improvements, map updates and bug fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience Season 4 of Deceive Inc. at the fastest frame rates with DLSS 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Back Soon For Even More RTX Games\nThere are even more DLSS integrations arriving soon for a whole host of games.

Revenue more than tripled, rising to $26.04 billion from $7.19 billion in the previous year.\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d CEO Jensen Huang declared on a conference call with analysts. Huang predicted that the companies snapping up Nvidia chips will use them to build a new type of data centers he called \u201cAI factories\u201d designed to produce \u201ca new commodity \u2014 artificial intelligence.\u201d Huang added that training AI models is becoming a faster process as they learn to become \u201cmultimodal\u201d \u2014 that is, capable of understanding text, speech, images, video and 3-D data \u2014 and also \u201cto reason and plan.\u201d\n\nThe company reported earnings per share \u2014 adjusted to exclude one-time items \u2014 of $6.12, well above the $5.60 that Wall Street analysts had expected, according to FactSet. It also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, a move that it noted will make its shares more accessible to employees and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            READ MORE\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $300 billion question: What to do with Russia\u2019s frozen central bank money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s BYD launches EV charging system it says works nearly as fast as a fill up\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion in the biggest deal in company\u2019s history\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it increased its dividend to 10 cents a share from 4 cents. Shares in Nvidia Corp. rose 6% in after-hours trading to $1,006.89. The stock has risen more than 200% in the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company, based in Santa Clara, California, carved out an early lead in the hardware and software needed to tailor its technology to AI applications, partly because founder and CEO Jensen Huang began to nudge the company into what was then seen as a still half-baked technology more than a decade ago. It also makes chips for gaming and cars. The company now boasts the third highest market value on Wall Street, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\n\u201cNvidia defies gravity again,\u201d Jacob Bourne, an analyst with Emarketer, said of the quarterly report. While many tech companies are eager to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, which has achieved a level of hardware dominance in AI rivaling that of earlier computing pioneers such as Intel Corp., \u201cthey\u2019re not quite there yet,\u201d he added.Demand for generative AI systems that can compose documents, make images and serve as increasingly lifelike personal assistants has fueled astronomical sales of Nvidia\u2019s specialized AI chips over the past year. Tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all signaled they will need to spend more in coming months on the chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.What happens after that could be another matter. Some analysts believe the breakneck race to build those huge data centers will eventually peak, potentially spelling trouble for Nvidia in the aftermath. \u201cThe biggest question that remains is how long this runway is,\u201d Third Bridge analyst Lucas Keh wrote in a research note. AI workloads in the cloud will eventually shift from training to inference, or the more everyday task of processing fresh data using already trained AI systems, he noted. And inference doesn\u2019t require the level of power provided by Nvidia\u2019s expensive top-of-the-line chips, which will open up market opportunities for chipmakers offering less powerful, but also less costly, alternatives.When that happens, Keh wrote, \u201cNvidia\u2019s dominant market share position will be tested.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDAVID HAMILTON\n\n\n                Hamilton is an Associated Press business and technology reporter based in San Francisco.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        twitter\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        mailto\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                            Most read\n                        \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge questions Trump administration on whether it ignored order to turn around deportation flights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Danish Viking blood is boiling.\u2019 Danes boycott US goods with fervor as others in Europe do so too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African ambassador has to leave the US by Friday, Trump administration says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration guts board of US Institute of Peace.

Following on from last year, this is a significant effort by the Japanese government to subsidize AI computing resources, by expanding the number of companies involved.\nWith this move, Japan becomes the latest nation to embrace the concept of sovereign AI, aiming to fortify its local startups, enterprises and research efforts with advanced AI technologies.\nAcross the globe, nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some procure and operate sovereign AI clouds with state-owned telecommunications providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use.\nJapan\u2019s initiative follows NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s visit last year, where he met with political and business leaders \u2014 including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida \u2014 to discuss the future of AI.\nDuring his trip, Huang emphasized that \u201cAI factories\u201d \u2014 next-generation data centers designed to handle the most computationally intensive AI tasks \u2014 are crucial for turning vast amounts of data into intelligence. \u201cThe AI factory will become the bedrock of modern economies across the world,\u201d Huang said during a meeting with the Japanese press in December.\nThe Japanese government plans to subsidize a significant portion of the costs for building AI supercomputers, which will facilitate AI adoption, enhance workforce skills, support Japanese language model development and bolster resilience against natural disasters and climate change.\nUnder the country\u2019s Economic Security Promotion Act, the ministry aims to secure a stable supply of local cloud services, reducing the time and cost of developing next-generation AI technologies.\nJapan\u2019s technology powerhouses are already moving fast to embrace AI. Last week, SoftBank Corp. announced that it will invest \u00a5150 billion, approximately $960 million, for its plan to expand the infrastructure needed to develop Japan\u2019s top-class AI, including purchases of NVIDIA accelerated computing.\nThe news follows Huang\u2019s meetings with leaders in Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam over the past year, as countries seek to supercharge their regional economies and embrace challenges such as climate change with AI.\n\n\nCategories: Cloud | Corporate | Generative AITags: Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

NVIDIA, Recursion Speed Pharma R&D\u00a0With AI Supercomputer\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBioHive, an engine powered by NVIDIA AI to speed the work of scientists in healthcare, rose more than a hundred spots on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\t\t\t\n\n\nMay 13, 2024 by Rory Kelleher \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tShare\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmail0 \n\n\n  Described as the largest system in the pharmaceutical industry, BioHive-2 at the Salt Lake City headquarters of Recursion debuts today at No. 35, up more than 100 spots from its predecessor on the latest TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers.\nThe advance represents the company\u2019s most recent effort to accelerate drug discovery with NVIDIA technologies.\n\u201cJust as with large language models, we see AI models in the biology domain improve performance substantially as we scale our training with more data and compute horsepower, which ultimately leads to greater impacts on patients\u2019 lives,\u201d said Recursion\u2019s CTO, Ben Mabey, who\u2019s been applying machine learning to healthcare for more than a decade.\nBioHive-2 packs 504 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs linked on an NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand network to deliver 2 exaflops of AI performance. The resulting NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD is nearly 5x faster than Recursion\u2019s first-generation system, BioHive-1.\nPerformance Powers Through Complexity\nThat performance is key to rapid progress because \u201cbiology is insanely complex,\u201d Mabey said.\nFinding a new drug candidate can take scientists years performing millions of wet-lab experiments.\nThat work is vital; Recursion\u2019s scientists run more than 2 million such experiments a week. But going forward, they\u2019ll use AI models on BioHive-2 to direct their platform to the most promising biology areas to run their experiments.\n\u201cWith AI in the loop today, we can get 80% of the value with 40% of the wet lab work, and that ratio will improve going forward,\u201d he said.\nBiological Data Propels Healthcare AI\nRecursion is collaborating with biopharma companies such as Bayer AG, Roche and Genentech. Over time, it also amassed a more than 50-petabyte database of biological, chemical and patient data, helping it build powerful AI models that are accelerating drug discovery.\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s one of the largest biological datasets on Earth \u2014 it was built with AI training in mind, intentionally spanning biology and chemistry,\u201d said Mabey, who joined the company more than seven years ago in part due to its commitment to building such a dataset.\nCreating an AI Phenomenon\nProcessing that data on BioHive-1, Recursion developed a family of foundation models called Phenom. They turn a series of microscopic cellular images into meaningful representations for understanding the underlying biology.\nA member of that family, Phenom-Beta, is now available as a cloud API and the first third-party model on NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI platform for drug discovery.\nOver several months of research and iteration, BioHive-1 trained Phenom-1 using more than 3.5 billion cellular images. Recursion\u2019s expanded system enables training even more powerful models with larger datasets in less time.\nThe company also used NVIDIA DGX Cloud, powered by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, to provide additional supercomputing resources to power their work.\nMuch like how LLMs are trained to generate missing words in a sentence, Phenom models are trained by asking them to generate the masked out pixels in images of cells.\nThe Phenom-1 model serves Recursion and its partners in several ways, including finding and optimizing molecules to treat a variety of diseases and cancers. Earlier models helped Recursion predict drug candidates for COVID-19 nine out of 10 times.\nThe company announced its collaboration with NVIDIA in July. Less than 30 days later, the combination of BioHive-1 and DGX Cloud screened and analyzed a massive chemical library to predict protein targets for approximately 36 billion chemical compounds.\nIn January, the company demonstrated LOWE, an AI workflow engine with a natural-language interface to help make its tools more accessible to scientists. And in April it described a billion-parameter AI model it built to provide a new way to predict the properties of key molecules of interest in healthcare.\nRecursion uses NVIDIA software to optimize its systems.\n\u201cWe love CUDA and NVIDIA AI Enterprise, and we\u2019re looking to see if NVIDIA NIM can help us distribute our models more easily, both internally and to partners,\u201d he said.\nA Shared Vision for Healthcare\nThe efforts are part of a broad vision that Jensen Huang, NVIDIA founder and CEO, described in a fireside chat with Recursion\u2019s chairman as moving toward simulating biology.\n\u201cYou can now recognize and learn the language of almost anything with structure, and you can translate it to anything with structure \u2026 This is the generative AI revolution,\u201d Huang said.\n\u201cWe share a similar view,\u201d said Mabey.\n\u201cWe are in the early stages of a very interesting time where just as computers accelerated chip design, AI can speed up drug design. Biology is much more complex, so it will take years to play out, but looking back, people will see this was a real turning point in healthcare,\u201d he added.\nLearn about NVIDIA\u2019s AI platform for healthcare and life sciences and subscribe to NVIDIA healthcare news.\nPictured at top: BioHive-2 with a few members of the Recursion team (from left) Paige Despain, John Durkin, Joshua Fryer, Jesse Dean, Ganesh Jagannathan, Chris Gibson, Lindsay Ellinger, Michael Secora, Alex Timofeyev, and Ben Mabey.\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | Customer Stories | DGX Cloud | Events | Hardware | Healthcare and Life Sciences | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | New GPU Uses | NVIDIA Hopper Architecture | NVIDIA NeMo | NVIDIA NIM | NVIDIA Quantum-2 | Science | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The effort is focused on helping customers better price and manage credit and market risk exposures of derivatives contracts.\nMore than 60,000 daily users in 65 countries rely on the Murex MX.3 platform. MX.3 assists banks, asset managers, pension funds and other financial institutions with their trading, risk and operations across asset classes.\nManaging Risk With MX.3 Driven by Grace Hopper\nFinancial institutions need high-performance computing infrastructure to run risk models on vast amounts of data for pricing and risk calculations, and to deliver real-time decision-making capabilities.\nMX.3 coverage includes both credit and market risk, BASEL capital standards, fundamental review of the trading book and x-valuation adjustment (XVA). XVA is used for different types of valuation adjustments related to derivative contracts, such as the credit value adjustment (CVA), the margin value adjustment and the funding valuation adjustment.\nMurex is testing Grace Hopper on the MX.3 platform for XVA calculations, as well as for market risk calibration, pricing evaluation, sensitivity, and profit and loss calculations on various asset classes.\nGrace Hopper offers faster calculation as well as power savings to the Murex platform.\n\u201cOn counterparty credit risk workloads such as CVA, Grace Hopper is the perfect fit, leveraging a heterogeneous architecture with a unique mix of CPU and GPU computations,\u201d Spatz said. \u201cOn risk calculations, Grace is not only the fastest processor, but also far more power-efficient, making green IT a reality in the trading world.\u201d\nWhen running XVA workloads in MX.3, the Murex research and development lab has noticed Grace Hopper can offer a 4x reduction in energy consumption and a 7x performance improvement compared with CPU-based systems.\n\nPricing FX Barrier Options in MX.3 With Grace Hopper\u00a0\nTo price foreign exchange (FX) barrier options, Murex has used its flagship and latest stochastic local volatility model and also noticed impressive performance improvements when running on Grace Hopper. A barrier option is a derivative with a payoff that relies on whether its underlying asset price reaches or crosses a specified threshold during the span of the option contract.\nThe pricing evaluation is done with a 2D partial differential equation, which is more cost-effective on the Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU in GH200. Pricing this derivative with MX.3 on Grace Hopper goes 2.3x faster compared with Intel Xeon Gold 6148.\n\nThe NVIDIA Grace CPU also offers significant power efficiencies for FX barrier calculations on a watts-per-server basis, and it\u2019s 5x better.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s next-generation accelerated computing platform is driving energy efficiency and cost-saving for high-performance computing for quantitative analytics in capital markets, says Murex, pointing to the results above.\nLearn about NVIDIA AI solutions for financial services. \n\u00a0\n\n\nCategories: Accelerated AnalyticsTags: GPU Computing | High-Performance Computing | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Speakers included Ujjwal Kumar, group president at Teradyne Robotics; Rainer Brehm, CEO of Siemens Factory Automation; and Deepu Talla, vice president of robotics and edge computing at NVIDIA.\n\u201cThe advent of generative AI coupled with simulation and digital twins technology is at a tipping point right now, and that combination is going to change the trajectory of robotics,\u201d commented Talla.\n\nThe Power of Partnerships\nThe discussion comes as the global robotics market continues to grow rapidly. The cobots market in Europe was valued at $286 million in 2022 and is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2032, at a yearly growth rate of more than 37%.\nPanelists discussed why teaming up is key to innovation for any company \u2014 whether a startup or an enterprise \u2014 and how physical AI is being used across businesses and workplaces, stressing the game-changing impact of advanced robotics.\nThe alliance between NVIDIA and Teradyne Robotics, which includes an AI-based intra-logistics solution alongside Siemens, showcases the strength of collaboration across the ecosystem. NVIDIA\u2019s prominent role as a physical AI hardware provider is boosting the cobot and AMR sectors with accelerated computing, while its collaboration with Siemens is transforming industrial automation.\n\u201cNVIDIA provides all the core AI capabilities that get integrated into the hundreds and thousands of companies building robotic platforms and robots, so our approach is 100% collaboration,\u201d Talla said.\n\u201cWhat excites me most about AI and robots is that collaboration is at the core of solving our customers\u2019 problems,\u201d Kumar added. \u201cNo one company has all the technologies needed to address these problems, so we must work together to understand and solve them at a very fast pace.\u201d\nAccelerating Innovation With AI\u00a0\nAI has already made huge strides across industries and plays an important role in enhancing advanced robotics. Leveraging machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, AI gives robots the cognitive capability to understand, learn and make decisions.\n\u201cFor humans, we have our senses, but it\u2019s not that easy for a robot, so you have to build these AI capabilities for autonomous navigation,\u201d Talla said. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s Isaac platform is enabling increased autonomy in robotics with rapid advancements in simulation, generative AI, foundation models and optimized edge computing.\u201d\nNVIDIA is working closely with the UR team to infuse AI into UR\u2019s robotics software technology. In the case of autonomous mobile robots that move things from point A to B to C, it\u2019s all about operating in unstructured environments and navigating autonomously.\nBrehm emphasized the need to scale AI by industrializing it, allowing for automated deployment, inference and monitoring of models \u2014 making AI easily accessible on the shopfloor. He spoke about empowering customers to utilize AI effortlessly, even without AI expertise. \u201cOur goal is to advance automation, moving towards a system that leverages skills-based automation in the future,\u201d he said.\nAs a leading robotics company with one of the largest installed bases of collaborative and AMRs, Teradyne has identified a long list of industry problems and is working closely with NVIDIA to solve them.\n\u201cI use the term \u2018physical AI\u2019 as opposed to \u2018digital AI\u2019 because we are taking AI to a whole new level by applying it in the physical world,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cWe see it helping our customers in three ways: adding new capabilities to our robots, making our robots smarter with advanced path planning and navigation, and further enhancing the safety and reliability of our collaborative robots.\u201d\nThe Impact of Real-World Robotics\nAutonomous machines, or AI robots, are already making a noticeable difference in the real world, from industries to our daily lives. Industries such as manufacturing are using advanced robotics to enhance efficiency, accuracy and productivity.\nCompanies want to produce goods close to where they are consumed, with sustainability being a key driver. But this often means setting up shop in high-cost countries. The challenge is twofold: producing at competitive prices and dealing with shrinking, aging workforces that are less available for factory jobs.\n\u201cThe problem for large manufacturers is the same as what small and medium manufacturers have always faced: variability,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cHigh-volume industrial robots don\u2019t suit applications requiring continuous design tweaks. Collaborative robots combined with AI offer solutions to the pain points that small and medium customers have lived with for years, and to the new challenges now faced by large manufacturers.\u201d\nAutomation isn\u2019t just about making things faster; it\u2019s also about making the most of the workforce. In manufacturing, automation aids smoother processes, ramps up safety, saves time and relieves pressure on employees.\n\u201cAutomation is crucial for solving problems and, to get there, AI is a game-changer. If you don\u2019t have the people who want to work in the factory, and you don\u2019t have the people to program the automation, you won\u2019t have the flexibility to automate what you need in the future. And that\u2019s what drives our customers,\u201d Brehm said.\nAI and computing technologies are set to redefine the robotics landscape, transforming robots from mere tools to intelligent partners capable of autonomy and adaptability across industries.\nFeature image by Steffen Stamp.

Tsushima Island is all that stands between mainland Japan and a massive Mongol invasion fleet led by the ruthless and cunning general, Khotun Khan.\nAs the island burns in the wake of the first wave of the Mongol assault, courageous samurai warrior Jin Sakai stands resolute. As one of the last surviving members of his clan, Jin is resolved to do whatever it takes, at any cost, to protect his people and reclaim his home. He must set aside the traditions that have shaped him as a warrior to forge a new path, the path of the Ghost, and wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Tsushima. For the very first time on PC, play through Jin Sakai\u2019s journey and discover the complete Ghost of Tsushima experience in this Director\u2019s Cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching May 16th, Ghost of Tsushima: Director\u2019s Cut includes out of the box support for our suite of game-enhancing technologies. DLSS 2 enables all GeForce RTX users to accelerate frame rates, DLSS 3 gives GeForce RTX 40 Series users the power of frame rate multiplication for the fastest performance possible, and DLAA uses a native resolution image to maximize image quality, rather than boosting performance. You can even combine DLAA and DLSS 3 Frame Generation for excellent image quality, and performance.\nAdditionally, GeForce gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex, which is available to use with any combination of settings on GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs. This game changing technology reduces system latency on GeForce graphics cards and laptops so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer matches, and making single-player titles more responsive and enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its debut in September 2020, NVIDIA Reflex has reduced system latency in over 100 games, and over 90% of GeForce gamers have enabled Reflex. 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters feature Reflex support, along with critically acclaimed co-op and single-player games. In 2023 alone, GeForce gamers played over 10 billion hours of their favorite titles with increased responsiveness thanks to Reflex\u2019s innovative system latency reducing technology.\nIf you\u2019re intending to play through this spectacular, critically acclaimed game, be sure to download and install our new Game Ready driver ahead of Ghost of Tsushima: Director\u2019s Cut\u2019s May 16th release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Homeworld 3, Featuring DLSS 2\nThe award-winning Homeworld franchise returns to PCs with long-awaited Homeworld 3. Assume control of a roving fleet and battle through dazzling, fully 3D spaces in strategic combat. Use the crumbling remains of an ancient civilization to funnel foes into a brilliant ambush or hide your fleet from powerful enemies. Attack head-on, with a clever flank, or even from above and below your foes.\nHomeworld 3\u2019s fully simulated ballistics make line of sight and cover critical strategic considerations. Your fleet persists from mission to mission. Scars on your ships linger. Strike craft pilots and capital ship captains pass along critical information through battlefield chatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeworld 3 launches May 13th, though gamers who pick-up the Fleet Command Edition can begin playing tomorrow, May 10th. Whenever you take to space in your mothership, you\u2019ll discover day-one support for DLSS 2, accelerating performance on GeForce RTX PCs. And if you find your frame rates fast enough, you can also activate Homeworld 3\u2019s ray-traced shadows to take visual fidelity and immersion to the next level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimal Settings For New Games\nOne-click optimal settings in GeForce Experience and the NVIDIA app enable you to instantly configure game options for your system\u2019s hardware, giving you smooth, optimized gameplay. Over 1200 titles are supported, and since our last driver release we\u2019ve added support for 5 more:\n\nContent Warning\nGray Zone Warfare\nManor Lords\nNo Rest for the Wicked\nOutpost: Infinity Siege\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver - Download Now\nLearn more about GeForce Game Ready Drivers here, and download the new GeForce Game Ready 552.44 WHQL driver through GeForce Experience, the NVIDIA app beta, or from GeForce.com.\nIf you experience any technical issues with the new Game Ready drivers please post a detailed report on theGeForce.com Driver Feedback Forum, where our Customer Care team can best assist you.

Applying it to data centers calls for unpacking some details.\nToday\u2019s most widely used gauge \u2014 power usage effectiveness (PUE)\u00a0 \u2014 compares the total energy a facility consumes to the amount its computing infrastructure uses. Over the last 17 years, PUE has driven the most efficient operators closer to an ideal where almost no energy is wasted on processes like power conversion and cooling.\nFinding the Next Metrics\nPUE served data centers well during the rise of cloud computing, and it will continue to be useful. But it\u2019s insufficient in today\u2019s generative AI era, when workloads and the systems running them have changed dramatically.\nThat\u2019s because PUE doesn\u2019t measure the useful output of a data center, only the energy that it consumes. That\u2019d be like measuring the amount of gas an engine uses without noticing how far the car has gone.\nMany standards exist for data center efficiency. A 2017 paper lists nearly three dozen of them, several focused on specific targets such as cooling, water use, security and cost.\nUnderstanding What\u2019s Watts\nWhen it comes to energy efficiency, the computer industry has a long and somewhat unfortunate history of describing systems and the processors they use in terms of power, typically in watts. It\u2019s a worthwhile metric, but many fail to realize that watts only measure input power at a point in time, not the actual energy computers use or how efficiently they use it.\nSo, when modern systems and processors report rising input power levels in watts, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re less energy efficient. In fact, they\u2019re often much more efficient in the amount of work they do with the amount of energy they use.\nModern data center metrics should focus on energy, what the engineering community knows as kilowatt-hours or joules. The key is how much useful work they do with this energy.\nReworking What We Call Work\nHere again, the industry has a practice of measuring in abstract terms, like processor instructions or math calculations. So, MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and FLOPS (floating point operations per second) are widely quoted.\nOnly computer scientists care how many of these low-level jobs their system can handle. Users would prefer to know how much real work their systems put out, but defining useful work is somewhat subjective.\nData centers focused on AI may rely on the MLPerf benchmarks. Supercomputing centers tackling scientific research typically use additional measures of work. Commercial data centers focused on streaming media may want others.\nThe resulting suite of applications must be allowed to evolve over time to reflect the state of the art and the most relevant use cases. For example, the last MLPerf round added tests using two generative AI models that didn\u2019t even exist five years ago.\nA Gauge for Accelerated Computing\nIdeally, any new benchmarks should measure advances in accelerated computing. This combination of parallel processing hardware, software and methods is running applications dramatically faster and more efficiently than CPUs across many modern workloads.\nFor example, on scientific applications, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center demonstrated an average of 5x gains in energy efficiency using accelerated computing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s among the 39 of the top 50 supercomputers \u2014 including the No. 1 system \u2014 on the Green500 list that use NVIDIA GPUs.\nBecause they execute lots of tasks in parallel, GPUs execute more work in less time than CPUs, saving energy.\nCompanies across many industries share similar results. For example, PayPal improved real-time fraud detection by 10% and lowered server energy consumption nearly 8x with accelerated computing.\nThe gains are growing with each new generation of GPU hardware and software.\nIn a recent report, Stanford University\u2019s Human-Centered AI group estimated GPU performance \u201chas increased roughly 7,000 times\u201d since 2003, and price per performance is \u201c5,600 times greater.\u201d\nData centers need a suite of benchmarks to track energy efficiency across their major workloads.\nTwo Experts Weigh In\nExperts see the need for a new energy-efficiency metric, too.\nWith today\u2019s data centers achieving scores around 1.2 PUE, the metric \u201chas run its course,\u201d said Christian Belady, a data center engineer who had the original idea for PUE. \u201cIt improved data center efficiency when things were bad, but two decades later, they\u2019re better, and we need to focus on other metrics more relevant to today\u2019s problems.\u201d\nLooking forward, \u201cthe holy grail is a performance metric. You can\u2019t compare different workloads directly, but if you segment by workloads, I think there is a better likelihood for success,\u201d said Belady, who continues to work on initiatives driving data center sustainability.\nJonathan Koomey, a researcher and author on computer efficiency and sustainability, agreed.\n\u201cTo make good decisions about efficiency, data center operators need a suite of benchmarks that measure the energy implications of today\u2019s most widely used AI workloads,\u201d said Koomey.\n\u201cTokens per joule is a great example of what one element of such a suite might be,\u201d Koomey added. \u201cCompanies will need to engage in open discussions, share information on the nuances of their own workloads and experiments, and agree to realistic test procedures to ensure these metrics accurately characterize energy use for hardware running real-world applications.\u201d\n\u201cFinally, we need an open public forum to conduct this important work,\u201d he said.\nIt Takes a Village\nThanks to metrics like PUE and rankings like the Green500, data centers and supercomputing centers have made enormous progress in energy efficiency.\nMore can and must be done to extend efficiency advances in the age of generative AI. Metrics of energy consumed doing useful work on today\u2019s top applications can take supercomputing and data centers to a new level of energy efficiency.\nTo learn more about available energy-efficiency solutions, explore NVIDIA sustainable computing.\n\n\nCategories: Data Center | Deep LearningTags: Artificial Intelligence | Cloud Services | GPU | GPU Computing | Hardware | High-Performance Computing | Machine Learning | Parallel Computing | Social Impact | Supercomputing \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

MITRE, a nonprofit organization that operates federally funded research and development centers, is implementing a new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD system that will provide researchers and developers access to massive computing leaps.\nThe DGX SuperPOD will support MITRE\u2019s Federal AI Sandbox, a platform to improve experimentation with next-generation, AI-enabled applications across federal government agencies.\n\u201cThe recent executive order on AI encourages federal agencies to reduce barriers for AI adoptions, but agencies often lack the computing environment necessary for experimentation and prototyping,\u201d said Charles Clancy, senior vice president and chief technology officer at MITRE. \u201cOur new Federal AI Sandbox will help level the playing field, making the high-quality compute power needed to train and test custom AI solutions available to any agency.\u201d\nThe Federal AI Sandbox will deliver federal agencies the computing gains needed to train large language models and other generative AI tools to develop cutting-edge applications.\nThe NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD powering the sandbox is capable of an exaFLOP of AI performance to enable researchers and developers to train and deploy custom LLMs and other AI solutions at scale.\n\u201cMITRE\u2019s purchase of a DGX SuperPOD will help turbocharge the U.S. federal government\u2019s development of its AI initiatives,\u201d said Anthony Robbins, vice president of public sector at NVIDIA. \u201cAI has enormous potential to improve government services for citizens and solve big challenges, like transportation and cybersecurity.\u201d\nThe supercomputing initiative comes as the White House recently unveiled plans, which include NVIDIA, for a $110 million partnership to help universities teach AI skills.\n\n\nCategories: Generative AITags: Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA DGX | Social Impact \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unleash your champion in pursuit of a legacy-defining F1\u00ae Career, the mode\u2019s first major update since 2016. Drive like the greatest and feel at one with the car through the all-new EA SPORTS Dynamic Handling System, and experience the best F1\u24c7 racing to date thanks to all of the game\u2019s new additions and enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF1\u00ae 24 is available from May 28th for players of the Champions Edition and EA Play Pro subscribers, with the general release following on May 31st. When GeForce RTX gamers take to the track, they\u2019ll discover day-one support for a massive range of experience-enhancing technology.\nDLSS Super Resolution enables all GeForce RTX users to accelerate frame rates, DLSS 3\u2019s Frame Generation technology gives GeForce RTX 40 Series users the power of frame rate multiplication for the fastest performance possible, and DLAA allows gamers with high-performing systems to use a native resolution image to maximize image quality. And you can combine DLAA and DLSS Frame Generation for excellent image quality and performance, for super fast, super detailed racing.\nAdditionally, GeForce gamers can activate NVIDIA Reflex in F1\u00ae 24. This game-changing technology reduces system latency on GeForce graphics cards and laptops so your actions occur quicker, giving you a competitive edge in multiplayer races, and making single-player races more responsive and enjoyable.\u00a0\nSince its debut in September 2020, NVIDIA Reflex has reduced system latency in over 100 games, and over 90% of GeForce gamers have enabled Reflex. 9 of the top 10 competitive shooters feature Reflex support, along with critically acclaimed co-op and single-player games.

In 2023 alone, GeForce gamers played over 10 billion hours of their favorite titles with increased responsiveness thanks to Reflex\u2019s innovative system latency reducing technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Ready For Serum, Featuring DLSS 3, DLAA & Reflex\nWith a thrilling narrative that drives the player forward under the pressure of time, Game Island and Toplitz Productions\u2019 Serum will put players to the ultimate test as they seek out ways of surviving a brutal world and uncovering a deadly conspiracy. The titular Serum is the essential elixir that can prolong life in the game\u2019s contaminated landscape, and amplify abilities associated with speed, sight and power.\nNot only will players need to carefully manage their found resources as they explore the world, but they will also need to keep an eye on the passage of time as it continually ebbs away, lest they perish from a lack of Serum. Serum\u2019s unique time mechanic, coupled with its crafting and serum brewing system, paves the way for experimentation and discovery as players harness the serum\u2019s potent abilities across different locations. This is all driven by an exciting narrative of conspiracy, cover-up, and scientific negligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering Early Access on May 23rd, Serum features day-one support for DLSS, DLAA, and Reflex, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive experience.

A new update, first demoed at GTC in March, expands the power of this RTX-accelerated chatbot app with additional features and support for new models.\nThe NVIDIA RTX Remix beta update brings NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction to the modding platform for even more impressive real-time ray tracing.\nSay It Out Loud\n\nChatRTX uses retrieval-augmented generation, NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software and NVIDIA RTX acceleration to bring chatbot capabilities to RTX-powered Windows PCs and workstations. Backed by its powerful large language models (LLMs), users can query their notes and documents with ChatRTX, which can quickly generate relevant responses, while running locally on the user\u2019s device.\nThe latest version adds support for additional LLMs, including Gemma, the latest open, local LLM trained by Google. Gemma was developed from the same research and technology used to create the company\u2019s Gemini models and is built for responsible AI development. ChatRTX also now supports ChatGLM3, an open, bilingual (English and Chinese) LLM based on the general language model framework.\nUsers can also interact with image data thanks to support for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training from OpenAI. CLIP is a neural network that, through training and refinement, learns visual concepts from natural language supervision \u2014 that is, the model recognizes what it\u2019s \u201cseeing\u201d in image collections. With CLIP support in ChatRTX, users can interact with photos and images on their local devices through words, terms and phrases, without the need for complex metadata labeling.\nThe new ChatRTX release also lets people chat with their data using their voice. Thanks to support for Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system that uses AI to process spoken language, users can send voice queries to the application and ChatRTX will provide text responses.\nDownload ChatRTX today.\nMix It Up\nWith RTX Remix, modders can transform classic PC games into RTX remasters using AI-accelerated tools on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.\nNow, they can use DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction in their projects with just a few clicks, thanks to an update to RTX Remix available this week. Its advanced, AI-powered neural renderer improves the fidelity, responsiveness and quality of ray-traced effects, giving NVIDIA GeForce RTX gamers an even better experience.\n\nAI powers other elements of the Remix workflow, too. Modders can use generative AI texture tools to analyze low-resolution textures from classic games, generate physically accurate materials \u2014 including normal and roughness maps \u2014 and upscale the resolution by up to 4x. Tools like this also save modders time, quickly handling a task that could otherwise become tedious.\nLearn more about the new RTX Remix beta update on the GeForce page.\nGenerative AI is transforming gaming, videoconferencing and interactive experiences of all kinds.

Drug discovery. Fusion energy. Scientific computing and physics-based simulations are poised to make giant steps across domains that benefit humanity as advances in accelerated computing and AI drive the world\u2019s next big breakthroughs.\nNVIDIA unveiled at GTC in March the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, which promises generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than the NVIDIA Hopper architecture.\nBlackwell has powerful implications for AI workloads, and its technology capabilities can also help to deliver discoveries across all types of scientific computing applications, including traditional numerical simulation.\nBy reducing energy costs, accelerated computing and AI drive sustainable computing. Many scientific computing applications already benefit. Weather can be simulated at 200x lower cost and with 300x less energy, while digital twin simulations have 65x lower cost and 58x less energy consumption versus traditional CPU-based systems and others.\nMultiplying Scientific Computing Simulations With Blackwell\nScientific computing and physics-based simulation often rely on what\u2019s known as double-precision formats, or FP64 (floating point), to solve problems. Blackwell GPUs deliver 30% more FP64 and FP32 FMA (fused multiply-add) performance\u00a0 than Hopper.\nPhysics-based simulations are critical to product design and development. From planes and trains to bridges, silicon chips and pharmaceuticals \u2014 testing and improving products in simulation saves researchers and developers billions of dollars.\nToday application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are designed almost exclusively on CPUs in a long and complex workflow, including analog analysis to identify voltages and currents.\nBut that\u2019s changing. The Cadence SpectreX simulator is one example of an analog circuit design solver. SpectreX circuit simulations are projected to run 13x quicker on a GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip \u2014 which connects Blackwell GPUs and Grace CPUs \u2014 than on a traditional CPU.\nAlso, GPU-accelerated computational fluid dynamics, or CFD, has become a key tool. Engineers and equipment designers use it to predict the behavior of designs. Cadence Fidelity runs CFD simulations that are projected to run as much as 22x faster on GB200 systems than on traditional CPU-powered systems. With parallel scalability and 30TB of memory per GB200 NVL72 rack, it\u2019s possible to capture flow details like never before.\nIn another application, Cadence Reality\u2019s digital twin software can be used to create a virtual replica of a physical data center, including all its components \u2014 servers, cooling systems and power supplies. Such a virtual model allows engineers to test different configurations and scenarios before implementing them in the real world, saving time and costs.\nCadence Reality\u2019s magic happens from physics-based algorithms that can simulate how heat, airflow and power usage affect data centers. This helps engineers and data center operators to more effectively manage capacity, predict potential operational problems and make informed decisions to optimize the layout and operation of the data center for improved efficiency and capacity utilization. With Blackwell GPUs, these simulations are projected to run up to 30x faster than with CPUs, offering accelerated timelines and higher energy efficiency.\n\nAI for Scientific Computing\nNew Blackwell accelerators and networking will deliver leaps in performance for advanced simulation.\nThe NVIDIA GB200 kicks off a new era for high-performance computing (HPC). Its architecture sports a second-generation transformer engine optimized to accelerate inference workloads for LLMs.\nThis delivers a 30x speedup on resource-intensive applications like the 1.8-trillion-parameter GPT-MoE (generative pretrained transformer-mixture of experts) model compared to the H100 generation, unlocking new possibilities for HPC. By enabling LLMs to process and decipher vast amounts of scientific data, HPC applications can sooner reach valuable insights that can accelerate scientific discovery.\nSandia National Laboratories is building an LLM copilot for parallel programming. Traditional AI can generate basic serial computing code efficiently, but when it comes to parallel computing code for HPC applications, LLMs can falter. Sandia researchers are tackling this issue head-on with an ambitious project \u2014 automatically generating parallel code in Kokkos, a specialized programming language designed by multiple national labs for running tasks across tens of thousands of processors in the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\nSandia is using an AI technique known as retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, which combines information-retrieval capabilities with language generation models. The team is creating a Kokkos database and integrating it with AI models using RAG.\nInitial results are promising. Different RAG approaches from Sandia have demonstrated autonomously generated Kokkos code for parallel computing applications. By overcoming hurdles in AI-based parallel code generation, Sandia aims to unlock new possibilities in HPC across leading supercomputing facilities worldwide.\u00a0Other examples include renewables research, climate science and drug discovery.\n\nDriving Quantum Computing Advances\nQuantum computing unlocks a time machine trip for fusion energy, climate research, drug discovery and many more areas. So researchers are hard at work simulating future quantum computers on NVIDIA GPU-based systems and software to develop and test quantum algorithms faster than ever.\nThe NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform enables both simulation of quantum computers and hybrid application development with a unified programming model for CPUs, GPUs and QPUs (quantum processing units) working together.\nCUDA-Q is speeding simulations in chemistry workflows for BASF, high-energy and nuclear physics for Stony Brook and quantum chemistry for NERSC.\nNVIDIA Blackwell architecture will help drive quantum simulations to new heights. Utilizing the latest NVIDIA NVLink multi-node interconnect technology helps shuttle data faster for speedup benefits to quantum simulations.\nAccelerating Data Analytics for Scientific Breakthroughs\u00a0\nData processing with RAPIDS is popular for scientific computing. Blackwell introduces a hardware decompression engine to decompress compressed data and speed up analytics in RAPIDS.\nThe decompression engine provides performance improvements up to 800GB/s and enables Grace Blackwell to perform 18x faster than CPUs \u2014 on Sapphire Rapids \u2014 and 6x faster than NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs for query benchmarks.\nRocketing data transfers with 8TB/s of high-memory bandwidth and the Grace CPU high-speed NVLink Chip-to-Chip (C2C) interconnect, the engine speeds up the entire process of database queries. Yielding top-notch performance across data analytics and data science use cases, Blackwell speeds data insights and reduces costs.\n\nDriving Extreme Performance for Scientific Computing with NVIDIA Networking\nThe NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand networking platform offers the highest throughput for scientific computing infrastructure.\nIt includes NVIDIA Quantum Q3400 and Q3200 switches and the NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNIC, together hitting twice the bandwidth of the prior generation. The Q3400 platform offers 5x higher bandwidth capacity and 14.4Tflops of in-network computing with NVIDIA\u2019s scalable hierarchical aggregation and reduction protocol (SHARPv4), providing a 9x increase compared with the prior generation.\nThe performance leap and power efficiency translates to significant reductions in workload completion time and energy consumption for scientific computing.\nLearn more about NVIDIA Blackwell. \n\n\nCategories: Data CenterTags: Artificial Intelligence | CUDA | HPC Stories | RAPIDS | Simulation and Design \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAll NVIDIA News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tAI Factories, Built Smarter: New Omniverse Blueprint Advances AI Factory Design and Simulation\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGTC 2025 \u2013 Announcements and Live Updates\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Launches NVIDIA Halos, a Full-Stack, Comprehensive Safety System for Autonomous Vehicles\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Accelerates Science and Engineering With CUDA-X Libraries Powered by GH200 and GB200 Superchips\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNVIDIA Open-Sources cuOpt, Ushering in New Era of Decision Optimization\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Information\nAbout NVIDIA\nCorporate Overview\nTechnologies\nNVIDIA Research\nInvestors\nSocial Responsibility\nNVIDIA Foundation\n \n\nGet Involved\nForums\nCareers\nDeveloper Home\nJoin the Developer Program\nNVIDIA Partner Network\nNVIDIA Inception\nResources for Venture Capitalists\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\nTechnical Training\nTraining for IT Professionals\nProfessional Services for Data Science\n \n\nNews & Events\nNewsroom\nNVIDIA Blog\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\nWebinars\nStay Informed\nEvents Calendar\nNVIDIA GTC\nNVIDIA On-Demand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nManage My Privacy\nLegal\nAccessibility\nProduct Security\nContact\n \n\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2025 NVIDIA Corporation \t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tUSA - United States\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0Share This\u00a0Facebook\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0Email \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare on Mastodon\n\n\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this Article\n\nFriend's Email Address\n\n\n\nYour Name\n\n\n\nYour Email Address\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n Send Email\n\n\nEmail sent!\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Combined, the systems deliver 200 exaflops, or 200 quintillion calculations per second, of energy-efficient AI processing power.\nNew Grace Hopper-based supercomputers coming online include EXA1-HE, in France, from CEA and Eviden; Helios at Academic Computer Centre Cyfronet, in Poland, from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE); Alps at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, from HPE; JUPITER at the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre, in Germany; DeltaAI at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; and Miyabi at Japan\u2019s Joint Center for Advanced High Performance Computing \u2014 established between the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Tsukuba and the Information Technology Center at the University of Tokyo.\nCEA, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, and Eviden, an Atos Group company, in April announced the delivery of the EXA1-HE supercomputer, based on Eviden\u2019s BullSequana XH3000 technology. The BullSequana XH3000 architecture offers a new, patented warm-water cooling system, while the EXA1-HE is equipped with 477 compute nodes based on Grace Hopper.\n\u201cAI is accelerating research into climate change, speeding drug discovery and leading to breakthroughs in dozens of other fields,\u201d said Ian Buck, vice president of hyperscale and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA Grace Hopper-powered systems are becoming an essential part of HPC for their ability to transform industries while driving better energy efficiency.\u201d\nIn addition, Isambard-AI and Isambard 3 from the University of Bristol in the U.K. and systems at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Texas Advanced Computing Center in the U.S. join a growing wave of NVIDIA Arm-based supercomputers using Grace CPU Superchips and the Grace Hopper platform.\nSovereign AI\r\nThe drive to construct new, more efficient, AI-based supercomputers is accelerating as countries around the world recognize the strategic and cultural importance of sovereign AI \u2014 investing in domestically owned and hosted data, infrastructure and workforces to foster innovation.\nBringing together the Arm-based NVIDIA Grace CPU and NVIDIA Hopper\u2122 GPU architectures using NVIDIA NVLink\u00ae-C2C interconnect technology, GH200 serves as the engine behind scientific supercomputing centers across the globe. Many centers are planning to go from system installation to real science in months instead of years.\nIsambard-AI phase one consists of an HPE Cray EX2500 supercomputer with 168 NVIDIA GH200 Superchips, making it one of the most efficient supercomputers ever built. When the remaining 5,280 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips arrive at the University of Bristol\u2019s National Composites Centre this summer, it will increase performance by about 32x.\n\u201cIsambard-AI positions the U.K. as a global leader in AI, and will help foster open science innovation both domestically and internationally,\u201d said Simon McIntosh-Smith, professor of high-performance computing at the University of Bristol. \u201cWorking with NVIDIA, we delivered phase one of the project in record time, and when completed this summer will see a massive jump in performance to advance data analytics, drug discovery, climate research and many more areas.\u201d\n\nAccelerating Scientific Discovery\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform comprises NVIDIA Hopper architecture-based GPUs, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips, NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips, NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking and a full suite of NVIDIA AI and HPC software.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips, NVIDIA Hopper architecture-based GPUs, NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchips, NVIDIA NVLink-C2C interconnect technology and NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking; third parties using and adopting our technologies and products, and the benefits thereof; AI accelerating research into climate change, speeding drug discovery and leading to breakthroughs in dozens of other fields; NVIDIA Grace Hopper-powered systems becoming an essential part of HPC for their ability to transform industries while driving better energy efficiency; many centers planning to go from system installation to real science in months instead of years; and the drive to construct new, more efficient, AI-based supercomputers accelerating as countries around the world recognize the strategic and cultural importance of sovereign AI \u2014 investing in domestically owned and hosted data, infrastructure and workforces to foster innovation; Isambard-AI helping foster open science innovation both domestically and internationally are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

Powered by the NVIDIA Hopper\u2122 architecture, the system will add a QPU from QuEra.\nPoland\u2019s Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC) has recently installed two photonic QPUs, built by ORCA Computing, connected to a new supercomputer partition accelerated by NVIDIA Hopper.\n\u201cUseful quantum computing will be enabled by the tight integration of quantum with GPU supercomputing,\u201d said Tim Costa, director of quantum and HPC at NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s quantum computing platform equips pioneers such as AIST, JSC and PSNC to push the boundaries of scientific discovery and advance the state of the art in quantum-integrated supercomputing.\u201d\nThe QPU integrated with ABCI-Q will enable researchers at AIST to investigate quantum applications in AI, energy and biology, utilizing Rubidium atoms controlled by laser light as qubits to perform calculations. These are the same type of atoms used in precision atomic clocks. Each atom is identical, providing a promising method of achieving a large-scale, high-fidelity quantum processor.\n\u201cJapan\u2019s researchers will make progress toward practical quantum computing applications with the ABCI-Q quantum-classical accelerated supercomputer,\u201d said Masahiro Horibe, deputy director of G-QuAT/AIST. \u201cNVIDIA is helping these pioneers push the boundaries of quantum computing research.\u201d\nPSNC\u2019s QPUs will enable researchers to explore biology, chemistry and machine learning with two PT-1 quantum photonics systems. The systems use single photons, or packets of light, at telecom frequencies as qubits. This allows for a distributed, scalable and modular quantum architecture using standard, off-the-shelf telecom components.\n\u201cOur collaboration with ORCA and NVIDIA has allowed us to create a unique environment and build a new quantum-classical hybrid system at PSNC,\u201d said Krzysztof Kurowski, CTO and deputy director of PSNC. \u201cThe open, easy integration and programming of multiple QPUs and GPUs efficiently managed by user-centric services is critical for developers and users. This close collaboration paves the way for a new generation of quantum-accelerated supercomputers for many innovative application areas, not tomorrow, but today.\u201d\nThe QPU integrated with JUPITER will enable JSC researchers to develop quantum applications for chemical simulations and optimization problems as well as demonstrate how classical supercomputers can be accelerated by quantum computers. It is built with superconducting qubits, or electronic resonant circuits, that can be manufactured to behave as artificial atoms at low temperatures.\n\u201cQuantum computing is being brought closer by hybrid quantum-classical accelerated supercomputing,\u201d said Kristel Michielsen, head of the quantum information processing group at JSC. \u201cThrough our ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA, JSC\u2019s researchers will advance the fields of quantum computing as well as chemistry and material science.\u201d\nBy tightly integrating quantum computers with supercomputers, CUDA-Q also enables quantum computing with AI to solve problems such as noisy qubits and develop efficient algorithms.\nCUDA-Q is an open-source and QPU-agnostic quantum-classical accelerated supercomputing platform. It is used by the majority of the companies deploying QPUs and delivers\u00a0best-in-class performance.\n\n\n\n\nAbout NVIDIA\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world leader in accelerated computing.\nCertain statements in this press release including, but not limited to, statements as to: the benefits, impact, performance, and availability of our products, services, and technologies, including NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform, NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, and NVIDIA Hopper architecture; NVIDIA accelerating quantum computing efforts at national supercomputing centers around the world with the open-source NVIDIA CUDA-Q platform; third parties using and adopting our technologies and products, our collaboration with third parties and the benefits and impact thereof, and the features, performance and availability of their offerings; useful quantum computing being enabled by the tight integration of quantum with GPU supercomputing; QPU integrated with ABCI-Q enabling researchers at AIST to investigate quantum applications in AI, energy and biology, utilizing Rubidium atoms controlled by laser light as qubits to perform calculations; and Japan\u2019s researchers making progress toward practical quantum computing applications with the ABCI-Q quantum-classical accelerated supercomputer are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially different than expectations.

Should You Buy Shares Before Then?\n\n\n  \n      By Beth McKenna\n  \n  \u2013\n  \n    \n      May 16, 2024 at 8:00AM\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to soar 242% and 411%, respectively, year over year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are high expectations, but there are good reasons to believe the company will comfortably exceed them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, there seems a good possibility that Nvidia will announce a stock split when it releases its quarterly report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASDAQ: NVDA\n\nNvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Cap\n$2.9T\n\n\n\n\nToday's Change\n\n\n\nArrow-Thin-Down\n\n\n\n(-2.11%)\u00a0-$2.52\n\n\n\nCurrent\u00a0Price\n$117.01\n\n\nPrice as of March 18, 2025, 2:58 p.m. ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's why the artificial intelligence (AI) tech leader is likely to beat Wall Street estimates when it reports its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, May 22.\n\nNvidia (NVDA -2.11%) stock is having another great year. In 2024, shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) tech giant have gained 91.9% through May 15, crushing the S&P 500 index's 11.9% return. The stock's longer-term performance is even more stunning, as it turned an investment of $5,000 into nearly $1 million over the last decade through April 29.\nA catalyst that might propel Nvidia stock higher is coming on Wednesday, May 22, after the market close. That's when the company is scheduled to release its results for its quarter ended on April 28.\nGiven Nvidia stock's fantastic recent performance, expectations are high and built into the stock price. For the stock to rise after the report, the company will likely have to at least comfortably beat Wall Street's estimates for the quarter and issue guidance for the next quarter that's notably higher than analysts are projecting.\nWhat are Wall Street's expectations?\nYou can use the below chart to gauge Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results. \n\n\n\nMetric\nFiscal Q1 2024 Result\nNvidia's Fiscal Q1 2025 Guidance\nNvidia's Projected Change\nWall Street's Fiscal Q1 2025 Consensus Estimate\nWall Street's Projected Change\n\n\nRevenue\n$7.19 billion\n$24 billion\n234%\n$24.57 billion\n242%\n\n\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS)\n$1.09\n$5.41*\n396%\n$5.57\n411%\n\n\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Fiscal Q1 2025 ended April 28, 2024. *Calculated by the author based on the metrics for which management provides guidance. Data as of May 15, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below chart can be used to gauge Nvidia's guidance for its fiscal second quarter. \n\n\n\nMetric\nFiscal Q2 2024 Result\nWall Street's Fiscal Q2 2025 Consensus Estimate\nWall Street's Projected Change\n\n\nRevenue\n$13.51 billion\n$26.57 billion\n97%\n\n\nAdjusted EPS\n$2.70\n$5.92\n119%\n\n\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo! Finance. Fiscal Q2 2025 ends in late July 2024. Data as of May 15, 2024.\nTwo reasons Nvidia seems poised to beat Wall Street's expectations\nThe first reason Nvidia looks poised to beat Wall Street's estimates has to do with management \"visibility.\" Nvidia's top management team has said on the company's recent quarterly analyst earnings calls that it has good visibility into near-term sales in its data center business. That's because the company has a backlog of orders to fulfill due to demand being so strong for its AI-enabling data center chips and related products.\nManagement probably has less of a handle on near-term demand for products in some of its other businesses. But that doesn't matter much because data center is by far Nvidia's largest market platform, and so it drives overall results.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe better management's visibility into near-term sales, the better idea it has of its near-term financial results. You can be sure Nvidia's savvy top management team set fiscal Q1 guidance at levels it feels very confident the company will exceed. Wall Street analysts use Nvidia's guidance to help establish their estimates. For many years analysts have underestimated the company's growth potential, and my bet is this dynamic will continue.\nThe second reason that Nvidia's upcoming report -- including from a fiscal Q2 guidance standpoint -- seems poised to be better than analysts expect stems from the recent quarterly reports of several of Nvidia's biggest customers. Companies such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft are continuing to ramp up their already significant spending on AI initiatives, which is a positive for Nvidia.\nFor instance, Meta now expects its full-year 2024 capital expenditures to range from $35 million to $40 million, up from its prior plan of $30 million to $37 billion. This is due to the company continuing to \"accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap,\" CFO Susan Li said on the Q1 earnings call. \n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock before May 22?\nOf course, there are no guarantees, but I think it's more likely than not that Nvidia stock will rise after the upcoming earnings release for the reasons just outlined. And there's another possible catalyst: The timing seems good for the company to announce a stock split.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, if you're a long-term investor, you don't need to concern yourself with trying to time your stock buys. Over the long term, if your bullish thesis is correct for Nvidia, it shouldn't make that much difference if you paid a bit more or less for its stock many years back.\nLet's look at an example. Nvidia stock closed at $946.30 per share on May 15. Exactly five years ago, the stock closed at $39.90, adjusted for stock splits. If you invested $1,000 in Nvidia stock five years ago, your investment would now be worth $23,717. Had you invested in the stock about five years ago and its price per share was, say, 15% higher than $39.90, or $45.89, your investment would now be worth $20,621. I'm guessing you'd be thrilled to have turned your $1,000 into nearly $21,000 in five years, and not kicking yourself for not doing a little better.\nA smart way to build your position in any stock is to invest the same dollar amount at regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly. This method eliminates the potential that you'll invest your entire amount at what turns out to be a near-term peak for the stock price.\n\n\n\nBeth McKenna has positions in Nvidia.

Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool   May 3, 2024 3 min read              In This Article:  NVDA            Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken the tech world by storm over the last year and a half.\u00a0While OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom, it's Nvidia that's captured most of the spoils thus far. Shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) superstar have jumped 500% since the start of 2023 as revenue and profits have skyrocketed. Nvidia's products comprise the backbone of AI infrastructure, and demand for them has been so strong that there have been shortages of GPUs.  On its recent earnings call, Tesla noted that it had installed 35,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs in supercomputers. It was the latest sign that Nvidia's hardware is shorthand for AI prowess, as the more of its components a company has, the more AI training and AI inference it can do. Given Nvidia's value in the AI race, it's only natural to wonder who Nvidia's biggest customer is.   Image source: Getty Images.   Nvidia's top customers Nvidia doesn't disclose who its biggest customer is. That's not surprising since that information would be valuable to competitors. However, in its recent 10-K filing, the company did say that one customer represented 13% of its revenue from its compute and networking segment, and an indirect customer that purchases Nvidia products through integrators and distributors, including the customer above, represents 19% of the company's revenue. This name is also from the compute and networking segment.  It's not completely clear who that customer is, but we have a good sense of who Nvidia's biggest customers may be based on media reports and deduction. Unsurprisingly, big tech companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet are believed to be among Nvidia's biggest customers, making up roughly 40% of its revenue. It's also clear that AI start-ups, like OpenAI, and autonomous vehicle companies, like Tesla, are significant customers of Nvidia. At this point, any company investing in AI is almost certainly an Nvidia customer. Nvidia's customer concentration does add some risk, especially if those big tech companies pulled back on spending, but the greater threat may be incoming competition from AMD and Intel. If Nvidia can defend itself from that, the stock should continue to be a winner. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Subsequently, several analysts raised their price targets on NVDA stock. In particular, the technology giant assuaged fears that enterprises would sit on the sidelines while waiting for Nvidia\u2019s latest chips.\nOn Wednesday, after the closing bell, the company disclosed that it posted adjusted earnings per share of $6.12, beating the consensus target of $5.59. It also beat on the top line, generating sales of $26.04 billion against analysts\u2019 view of $24.65 billion. Further, management stated that it anticipates revenue to reach $28 billion in Q2. In contrast, covering experts were looking for $26.61 billion.\nOver the past year, a myriad of tech enterprises, from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), ordered billions of dollars worth of Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs). These advanced chips help power artificial intelligence (AI) based protocols and platforms.\nIn response to the blistering print, JPMorgan Chase represented one of the many investment firms that raised their price target on NVDA stock. Specifically, JPMorgan\u2019s Harlan Sur lifted the per-share forecast to $1,150 from $850, maintaining an \u201coverweight\u201d rating.\nIn a note to clients, Sur was impressed with Nvidia\u2019s \u201cincreasing breadth of the customer demand, with enterprise/enterprise verticals driving strong Q/Q growth in addition to consumer internet hyperscalers.\u201d\nNVDA Stock Jumps After Addressing \u201cAir Pocket\u201d Concerns\nPrior to the Q1 earnings disclosure, concerns circulated that Nvidia could post disappointing results. Earlier in the week, the Financial Times reported that Amazon Web Services (AWS) stopped ordering Nvidia\u2019s most advanced chip called the \u201cGrace Hopper.\u201d Instead, the business unit would allegedly wait for Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell processor.\nHowever, AWS clarified the record, stating that the transition applied only to a sole supercomputer project that Amazon and Nvidia were jointly developing. At the time, the clarification didn\u2019t quite address concerns about NVDA stock as it faded heading into the earnings disclosure. In the run-up to the Q1 print, analysts worried about an \u201cair pocket\u201d forming within the product cycle.\nEssentially, enterprises might hold off on Hopper orders and wait for the Blackwell processor. Doing so may lead to demand lumpiness. In addition, a surge in Blackwell demand could cause supply chain inefficiencies, translating to missed opportunities.\nHowever, Nvidia eased such anxieties with its robust financials, which signaled ongoing momentum. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon boosted the price target of NVDA stock to $1,300, stating that the \u201cnarrative is clearly nowhere near its end, or likely nowhere near its peak.\u201d\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Let's find out.\n\nThe AI chip market's massive growth should be a long-term tailwind for Nvidia\nAllied Market Research estimates that the global AI chip market was worth just under $15 billion in 2022. However, by 2032, the market research firm expects sales of AI chips to generate annual revenue of nearly $384 billion. Nvidia is in the driver's seat in this space, controlling an estimated 94% of the AI chip market last year, per Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities.\nNvidia's first-mover advantage in AI chips has paid off handsomely for the company. Its graphics cards have been extremely popular and deployed by major cloud computing providers and start-ups to train AI models, including ChatGPT. As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue has been growing at a stunning rate. In fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 28, 2024, the company reported data center revenue of $47.5 billion, up a massive 217% from the previous year.\nNvidia, however, is expected to cede some ground in the AI chip market to rivals. Rakesh, for instance, expects the company's AI chip share to slip to 75% over the next couple of years as the likes of Intel (INTC 1.75%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.52%) bring competitive offerings into the market. AMD witnessed an 80% year-over-year increase in sales of its data center chips in the first quarter of 2024 to $2.3 billion, thanks to the growing demand for its AI accelerators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nvidia competitor expects to sell $4 billion worth of AI graphics cards this year, which is double its initial estimate of $2 billion. Analysts, however, expect AMD to end the year with as much as $8 billion in revenue from sales of AI-focused data center chips.\nIntel management also pointed out on the company's latest earnings conference call that its new Gaudi 3 data center accelerators are gaining traction and could generate $500 million in revenue in the second half of 2024, followed by a stronger showing next year. Nvidia, however, is expected to be in a league of its own.\nAccording to market research firm Omdia, the chipmaker could sell $87 billion worth of data center graphics cards this year. That would be a huge jump from the $34 billion the company generated through data center chip sales last year. Even better, Rakesh forecasts Nvidia could sell $280 billion worth of data center graphics cards in 2027 despite the potential loss in market share. That's not surprising, considering how fast this space is growing.\nIn simple words, there is enough room for Nvidia to grow in the AI chip market even if the competition gets stronger. Throw in the potential growth the company could witness in other markets, such as gaming, it is easy to see why analysts expect Nvidia to clock healthy earnings growth for the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much upside can investors expect over the next five years?\nConsensus estimates predict Nvidia's earnings will increase at an annual rate of just over 35% for the next five years. Based on the company's fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.96 per share, its bottom line could jump to $58.11 per share after five years, assuming it does increase at the predicted rate.\nThe good part is that the company seems capable of delivering the growth that analysts are expecting from it based on the points discussed above and Nvidia's commanding pricing power in the AI chip space. Not surprisingly, analysts bumped up Nvidia's earnings estimates significantly for the current and the next two fiscal years, as seen in the chart below.\n\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\nAs such, there is a good chance that Nvidia's earnings could indeed touch the projected $58.11 per share after five years. Multiplying the projected earnings with Nvidia's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39 suggests that its stock price could hit $2,266 per share (barring any stock splits or other events) after five years. That would translate into a jump of 162% from current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, investors who haven't bought this AI stock yet can still consider doing so, as its impressive rally seems sustainable over the next five years.\n\n\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\n\n                                  Jeff Chiu/AP Photo\n                                 \n\n\n\n\n\nNvidia's first-quarter earnings results this week could move the whole stock market.\u00a0\nIts soaring revenue and profits have driven the bulk of the S&P 500's earnings growth over the past year.\u00a0\nBank of America shared how investors can hedge against the risk of Nvidia's earnings swinging the broader market.\nAll eyes are on Nvidia this week as the company gears up to report its first-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday.\n\n\nThe chip maker's earnings report could drive a big move in the stock market, both to the upside or downside, depending on how the results shake out.\nCurrent options pricing implies Nvidia will jump or fall 8.5% after its earnings results, which is markedly lower than prior Nvidia earnings releases when options traders were implying a move of of 14%-26%.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        \n                        Bank of America\n                        \n                        \n\n\nThat's because Nvidia and its successful lineup of AI-focused GPUs have had a massive impact on the earnings growth of the S&P 500. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia's earnings growth drove 37% of the S&P 500's earnings per share growth. But over the next 12 months, Nvidia's earnings growth is expected to drive just 9% of the S&P 500's earnings growth.\nThis dynamic highlights the potential market-shaking impact Nvidia could have on the broader stock market this week, and Bank of America has a way to hedge against the risk.\nInstead of buying put or call options on the major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, Bank of America recommends investors buy call or put options on Nvidia itself.\n\n\nIn other words, if an investor believes the stock market is going to fall this week on Nvidia's earnings results, instead of buying put options in the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, they should buy put options in Nvidia, and vice versa with call options if they believe the stock market will rise.\u00a0\n\"For those worried about the (positive or negative) impact of NVDA earnings on the broader market, NVDA options offer better value than hedging through indices like QQQ, SPY, SMH (Semis ETF),\" Bank of America said.\nThe reason is that Nvidia options cost less than options on the broader indices, according to the bank, likely due to the strong liquidity and trading interest in the AI giant.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Don't mess with proxies; hedge with NVDA options,\" Bank of America said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                                Read next\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Market\n\n\nEarnings\n\n\nAnalyst Note\n \nMore \n\n\n\n\nMarkets\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\nYour Market View\n\n\nNAME / PRICE\n+ / -\n%\nDATE\n\n\n\n\nRecommended video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stocks\n                          Disclaimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFollow us on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndices\n\nDow Jones\nS&P 500\nNasdaq 100\nNasdaq Composite\nFTSE 100\nNikkei 225\nDAX 40\nHang Seng\nKospi\nS&P TSX Composite Index\nASX\nUS Dollar Index\nStock Indices\nDow Futures\nDow Jones Market Movers\n\n\n\nCommodities\n\nGold Price\nOil Price\nSilver Price\nCopper Price\nCotton Price\nHeating Oil Price\nAluminum Price\nNatural Gas Price\nRealtime Commodity Prices\n\n\n\nCurrencies\n\nEURO DOLLAR\nBitcoin Price\nETH USD\nCAD USD\nPESO USD\nPOUND USD\nUSD INR\nCurrency Converter\nExchange Rates\n\n\n\nStocks\n\nGoogle Stock\nMeta Stock\nAmazon Stock\nTesla Stock\nDow-Stock\nPremarket\nStock Market News\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more\n                    - Explore more categories\n                \n \n\n\n*\u00a9 2025 Insider Inc. and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

Is It a\u2026This Underperforming Chip Stock Wants to Take On Nvidia. Is It a Buy?NVDASPXINTCMBLYSemiconductor stocks remain in focus, as the pivot to artificial intelligence (AI) has fueled the demand for chips, and Nvidia NVDA has become a $2 trillion giant riding the AI wave. NVDA, which was the best-performing S&P 500 Index SPX constituent last year, is holding up as the index's second-best performer so far in 2024.On the other side of the spectrum is Intel INTC, which is the worst-performing S&P 500 stock, sporting YTD losses of 40.3%. Intel\u2019s underperformance is not limited to 2024 alone; the stock has lost almost a third of its market cap over the last five years.\u00a0Moreover, Intel stock is up by all of about 8% over the last two decades, in absolute terms - making it among the biggest wealth destroyers during the period, even after accounting for its dividend.Barchart Intel Stock Is a Long-Term Underperformer\u00a0Intel has missed many buses over the years, including the smartphone (and iPhone) revolution. More recently, Intel - like other chip companies - lost out to Nvidia, which capitalized on the AI boom.\u00a0Nvidia\u2019s revenues in the current fiscal year are expected to be over 10 times what it generated in fiscal year 2020. On the other hand, Intel is expected to post revenues of $62.7 billion in the current year, which - despite being 12.4% higher than the previous year - is significantly below the $77.8 billion it generated in 2020.Pat Gelsinger\u2019s IDM 2.0 Transformation\u00a0Intel brought back Pat Gelsinger as CEO in early 2021, who soon outlined his \u201cIDM 2.0\u201d transformation strategy to resurrect the once-formidable chip company. Among others, Intel doubled down on innovation and announced that it would also start making chips for other companies and build new fab units.The stars seemed to be aligning for the foundry business as Intel secured billions of dollars in funding under the CHIPS Act. Given the strategic importance of chips \u2013 which became even more apparent during the COVID-19 supply chain crisis \u2013 countries globally are looking to manufacture these critical components domestically, and the U.S. is no exception.Intel\u2019s Business StrategyIntel\u2019s business strategy appears to be three-fold. It is working on advanced chips, including those with AI capabilities, to drive the sales of its Intel Products segment. Specifically, it has launched its Gaudi 3, which it says could \u201cdeliver on average 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than Nvidia H100 on leading generative AI (GenAI) models.\u201dFor its foundry business, which produces chips for the company as well as third parties, the strategy is to onboard more customers to drive operating leverage through increased production. During the Q1 earnings call, Gelsinger said, \u201cWe have clear line of sight to becoming the largest system foundry for the AI era and the second largest overall by 2030.\u201dFinally, in its All Other segment, it is looking to unlock value. The company has already listed its Mobileye MBLY self-driving unit, and is looking at an IPO of Altera, as well.During the Q1 earnings call, Gelsinger reiterated that the transformation is a multi-year plan that needs large investments upfront. These investments have hampered Intel\u2019s margins, as well as its cash flows, in the short term.The company\u2019s guidance has also trailed estimates for the last two quarters, which is only adding to the pessimism - and has been among the key reasons behind the stock\u2019s 2024 underperformance.Has INTC Stock Bottomed?During the Q1 earnings call, Gelsinger stressed that Q1 was the bottom for the company, and said Intel should report sequential revenue growth in the coming quarters this year as well as in 2025.\u00a0He listed commercial PC refresh, demand for AI PCs, a recovery in the data center business, and \u201ccyclical recoveries\u201d in Mobileye, Altera, and NEX as catalysts to drive growth in the coming quarters.Intel Stock ForecastAnalysts are not sold on Gelsinger\u2019s transformation plan, though \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s what their ratings on INTC stock tell us. Of the 35 analysts covering Intel stock, only 6 rate it as either a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d or \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d while 25 rate it as a \u201cHold\u201d or some equivalent. The remaining 4 rate INTC as a \u201cStrong Sell.\u201dBarchart One silver lining in analysts\u2019 ratings is Intel\u2019s mean target price of $40.29, which is 34% higher than yesterday\u2019s closing prices. By comparison, Nvidia\u2019s mean target price of $955.78 is just 5.7% higher than yesterday\u2019s closing prices.That said, Nvidia is set to report its earnings later this month, after which analysts might raise the stock\u2019s target price \u2013 as they have done following the last several earnings calls. Analysts have generally found themselves playing catchup with Nvidia\u2019s price action, as the stock seems to run ahead too fast and too soon.Also, I won\u2019t put Nvidia and Intel in the same league, as the Jensen Huang-led company is way ahead with its AI chips. Intel, for instance, expects Gaudi 3 to generate sales of $500 million in the back half of the year, which is a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars in revenues Nvidia is raking in from sales of AI chips.Is Intel Stock Cheap at These Levels?Valuing Intel is also a bit tricky here, as its earnings are currently subdued due to ongoing investments in its transformation, which is distorting the multiples. Its next 12-month (NTM) price-to-earnings multiple stands at 24.2x, which is significantly higher than historical averages and is reflective of the current depressed earnings. Intel\u2019s NTM price-to-sales multiple is 2.25x, however, which is below the five-year average of 2.88x.I find Intel stock somewhat cheap (but not mouthwatering) here, and see it as a transformation play. To be sure, corporate transformations are a much-abused word, and are far from easy. However, despite Intel\u2019s perennial underperformance, I won't give up on the stock yet, and believe the worst could be over.\u00a0If Q1 was indeed the bottom for revenue growth, as management highlighted during its Q1 earnings call, Intel could see better days ahead and reverse some of its YTD underperformance.On the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: INTC , NVDA .

[+] CPU used for generative AI at supermicro keynote presentation during the COMPUTEX 2023. The COMPUTEX 2023 runs from 30 May to 02 June 2023 and gathers over 1,000 exhibitors from 26 different countries with 3000 booths to display their latest products and to sign orders with foreign buyers. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nAbout a year ago, Nvidia released an earnings report that captured the attention of investors around the world. Since then, the chip design giant\u2019s stock has soared 248%.\n\nOn May 23, Nvidia realized my April prediction in a Forbes post \u2014 a strong quarterly earnings report could propel the company\u2019s stock price past $1,000 a share.\n\n\nNvidia \u2014 which contracts out chip manufacturing \u2014 not only beat expectations and raised guidance. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, bought back billions of dollars\u2019 worth of stock, and considerably boosted its dividend.\n\nWhen the split sends Nvidia\u2019s stock price down to around $100 a share, I expect the company could sustain the high growth that sent its stock price soaring for years to come.\n\nHere are three reasons its shares could again top $1,000 post-split:\n\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s great performance and prospects;\nNvidia\u2019s successful growth investments; and\nCEO Jensen Huang\u2019s leadership \u2014 which could also be Nvidia\u2019s biggest investment risk should he leave the job without a more capable successor.\n\nForbesWhy Nvidia Stock Could Top $1,000 A Share After May Earnings ReportBy Peter Cohan\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nNvidia\u2019s Great First Quarter Performance And Prospects\nNvidia faced an exceptionally high growth hurdle as the anniversary of its mind-blowing earnings report released in May 2023 neared. That announcement, which covered Q1 of the company's 2024 fiscal year, featured a 54% better-than-expected growth forecast.\n\nBelow are the key investor expectations for Nvidia in the most recent quarter ending April 28, 2024 (Q1 of fiscal year 2025) and how much the company beat those ambitious targets.\n\n\nFY 2025 Q1 net sales forecast: $24.22 billion \u2014 237% more than the year before, according to Yahoo! Finance. Nvidia beat that target by $1.78 billion \u2014 generating $26.04 billion in revenue, according to CNBC.\nFY 2025 Q1 gross margin forecast: 77.03% \u2014 13 percentage points more than the year before, Yahoo! Finance noted. Nvidia reported a 78.4% gross margin for the quarter \u2014 1.37 percentage points above consensus, noted a company statement.\nFY 2025 Q1 adjusted earnings per share forecast: $5.50 \u2014 405% higher than the year before, according to CNBC. Nvidia reported adjusted EPS of $6.12 \u2014 exceeding the forecast by 62 cents a share, CNBC wrote.\nFY 2025 Q2 revenue forecast: $28 billion \u2014 107.4% above revenue for the same quarter a year ago and above analysts\u2019 expectations, noted the Journal.\n\n\n\n\nNvidia also decided to take a bow for investors such as Warren Buffett who like stock buybacks and dividends.\nTo that end, the chip designer announced a 10-for-1 stock split effective June 7, bought back $7.7 billion of the company\u2019s shares, and more than doubled its per-share dividend from four cents to 10 cents based on the current share count, noted the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cWe are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun.\u201dForbesNvidia Stock Is Up 150% And 3 Key Advantages Could Keep It RisingBy Peter Cohan\nNvidia\u2019s Growth Investments\nThe most important question a CEO must answer is: Whither future growth? In my book, Disciplined Growth Strategies, I described a canvas on which leaders can paint their future growth trajectories. This canvas consists of five dimensions of growth \u2014 new or current customer groups, products, geographies, capabilities, and culture.\nIn high-tech markets, business leaders must place the right bets on future growth opportunities before their rivals beat them to the punch. Since technology product life cycles are short and rivals are quick to copy innovations, such bets are vital for sustaining rapid growth.\nFor Nvidia, the key dimensions of growth are customer group and product. Here are the company\u2019s key bets on each dimension:\n\n\nCustomer group: data centers. Nvidia enjoyed a 427% increase in data center revenue \u2014 what Huang refers to as AI factories, according to the New York Times\nNew York Times\n . Those account for $22.6 billion in revenue for the chip designer. Corporate luminaries \u2014 including Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon\nAmazon\n, OpenAI and Tesla \u2014 are among more than 100 customers purchasing GPUs from Nvidia, the Times wrote. The quantity of those purchases ranges from hundreds to 100,000. For example, Tesla is using 35,000 H100 chips to help train models for autonomous driving, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told the Times.\nProducts: H100, Blackwell, and InfiniBand. Nvidia\u2019s most important AI product has been the H100 \u2014 a GPU used to train large language models. As I wrote in April, Nvidia plans to ship a successor \u2014 Blackwell \u2014 which Huang predicted would generate \u201ca lot of revenue\u201d for Nvidia this year, according to the company\u2019s Q1 FY 2025 investment conference call. Nvidia also reported a more than tripling in revenue to $3.2 billion from the company\u2019s InfiniBand networking parts, which companies value more highly as they build \u201cclusters of tens of thousands of chips that need to be connected,\u201d noted CNBC.\n\n\nUnder Huang\u2019s leadership, Nvidia\u2019s share of the AI chip industry has reached somewhere between 80% and 95%, I wrote in a February 2024 article on Forbes.\nSigns of Nvidia\u2019s market power include:\n\n\nHigh willingness to pay. Customers are willing to pay a significant premium and to wait for more than a year to obtain Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nTime savings offset the high price. Nvidia chips are expensive; however, Nvidia says they enable companies to save time training LLMs \u2014 which more than offsets the price premium.\nDevelopers build on Nvidia first. Rivals who copy Nvidia hardware are always racing to catch up. The 2006 launch and ongoing improvement of CUDA \u2014 the company\u2019s software for programming GPUs \u2014 is the most important reason designers choose Nvidia.\n\nForbesNvidia Stock Could Rise 10-Fold On New $10 Billion Growth VectorBy Peter Cohan\nThe Biggest Risk To Nvidia\u2019s Continued Success\nThe biggest risk to Nvidia\u2019s continuing stock market rise is the company\u2019s dependence on Huang \u2014 who at some point will no longer be the company\u2019s CEO.\nAs I described in my forthcoming book, Brain Rush, Huang is the rare CEO \u2014 accounting for fewer than 0.4% of founders who can turn an idea into a public company worth billions (or in Nvidia\u2019s case, trillions) of dollars.\nHe has done a great job in five of the six key leadership tasks that distinguish such leaders:\n\n\nFuel cognitive hunger \u2014 meaning Huang maintains his desire to learn new things and sustains a healthy paranoia.\nSolve the right problem well \u2014 as described above, Nvidia provides world-class solutions to unmet customer needs.\nWin and keep customers \u2014 the AI chip designer has excelled at winning customers and selling them more of the company\u2019s products.\nAdapt to changing headwinds and tailwinds \u2014 Nvidia quickly shifted its design focus from gaming, to blockchain, to generative AI as Huang saw new growth.\nInvest in new growth opportunities \u2014 Nvidia built new products and protected their value from rivals with software and partnerships.\n\n\nThe final leadership task is preparing the next CEO. Is Huang developing a successor who could do the CEO job as well or better than he is doing it now? An opinion column in TechNewsWorld argued Huang would keep serving as CEO for a decade and gradually replace himself with \u201cdigital Jensen Huangs.\u201d I can\u2019t help but wonder whether this is a joke.\nNvidia officially considers succession planning to be important. For example, it operates a management development and exposure program involving more than \u201c60 senior managers working directly with the CEO to execute corporate strategies,\u201d according to the company\u2019s 2024 annual report. Nvidia also offers executive development programs including \u201c training courses, mentoring, peer coaching, and ongoing feedback.\u201d\nHow Nvidia\u2019s Post-Split Stock Could Rise Tenfold\nIn the year since Nvidia\u2019s boffo Q1 FY 2024 report released in May 2023, the company\u2019s stock has risen 248%.\nNvidia stock \u2014 after splitting 10-for-1 early in June \u2014 could rise from $100 to $1,000 by 2026. This optimistic scenario assumes Nvidia keeps beating growth expectations and raising its forecasts \u2014 resulting in a 248% annual increase in the company\u2019s stock price over the next two years.\nOptimism is certainly justified, according to one analyst. \u201cI say it's the most important company in the world, as far as innovation,\u201d Jim Roppel, founder of The Roppel Report, told Investor\u2019s Business Daily. \n\u201cNvidia has managed to leapfrog from one tech trend to another, beginning with video games, then moving to things like automotive applications and now generative AI,\u201d he added.\nGenerative AI\u2019s productivity benefits could crimp inflation \u2014 sustaining strong demand for Nvidia\u2019s products. \u201cThe major innovation cycle is healthy and thriving,\u201d he told IBD. \u201cI really think this golden goose is ripping. The golden goose is working overtime here.\u201d\nAnother analyst is less sanguine. Nvidia stock could drop unless it beats expectations by at least $1.5 billion in future quarters, according to a May 20 client note by Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland that appeared in a Journal report.\nAnother risk to investors is: \u201cMoves from competitors\u2014including in-house chip efforts at its own largest customers,\u201d the Journal noted.\nSomeday the Nvidia bears will be right. That day could be a decade away.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website or some of my other work.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

It reported $5.47 billion in revenue, which is only just above Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $5.45 billion.\nNext is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) with its fiscal Q3 revenue of $3.85 billion. That\u2019s below analysts\u2019 estimate of $3.9 billion for the quarter. The company\u2019s revenue missed estimates as it faced shortages of core components.\nWhat This Means for NVDA Stock\nAll of this news has investors spooked about Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report. The chipmaker is expected to release results roughly one month from now. That means there\u2019s plenty of time for investors to shake off the AMD and SMCI earnings reports ahead of it.\nAs for what to expect from Nvidia, Wall Street is estimating EPS of $5.18 for the quarter. Revenue estimates are sitting at $22.85 billion. Investors will be keeping a close eye on these financials considering today\u2019s chipmaker results.\nNVDA stock is down 3.6% as of Wednesday morning but is still up 72.9% since the start of the year. The company has been leading an artificial intelligence (AI) rally throughout 2024 alongside AMD and SMCI.\nInvestors will find even more of the most recent stock market stories ready to go below!\nWe are offering up all of the hottest stock market news traders need to know about on Wednesday! A few examples include what\u2019s happening with shares of Getaround (NYSE:GETR), more details on SMCI and the latest Cemtrex (NASDAQ:CETX) stock news.

[+] decade.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization of $2.8 trillion is just 3% shy of Apple\u2019s $2.9 trillion valuation and 11% shy of Microsoft\u2019s $3.2 trillion.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a stunning turn from the end of 2014, when the market valued Nvidia at just $11 billion, Apple at $643 billion and Microsoft at $382 billion.\n\n\n\nHaving already surpassed other more established technology titans Google and Amazon earlier this year in market cap amid its 130% year-to-date stock rally, Nvidia would need just another $35 increase in its share price to surpass Apple by total value and a $140-per-share rally to surpass Microsoft.\n\n\n\nIf recent performance is any indication, that\u2019s a doable feat, as Nvidia\u2019s share price has increased by $70 or more in two of the last four trading days alone.\n\n\nThere are plenty of believers on Wall Street who think Nvidia can surge past a $3 trillion valuation, with about a third of analyst price targets tracked by FactSet above the $1,220 per share Nvidia stock needs to become the third-ever company to ever crack that $3 trillion threshold.\n\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\n\nWhat To Watch For\nIf Nvidia stock were to perform anything close to its recent market-leading returns in the future, it would become by far the most valuable company in the world\u2014a perhaps foolish bet considering though the most bullish mainstream analysts only forecast 23% upside for Nvidia\u2019s stock over the next 12 months, though it\u2019s a fun thought exercise. If Nvidia stock were to match its 195% return over the last 12 months from now through May 2025, it would achieve a market cap of $8.4 trillion, a valuation equivalent to the combined market values of Apple, Microsoft and Google.\n\nWhy Is Nvidia Stock Up So Much?\nNvidia is the biggest player in the hottest market on the planet right now, designing an estimated 80% of the semiconductor chips powering generative AI technology, according to Goldman Sachs research. That gives Nvidia immense future earnings potential, especially considering its immense pricing power in dangling its technology to its chip-hungry customers like Apple and Microsoft. The early impact of the AI revolution on Nvidia\u2019s bottom line is apparent, as its $54 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) over its four most recent quarters is six times higher than its $10 billion EBITDA for 12-month period ending in April 2023. Meanwhile, Apple has dealt with stalling profit growth, with its free cash flow down by 20% in its most recent quarter. More colorfully, if you\u2019re to believe we\u2019re in the early stages of a \u201cnew industrial revolution\u201d thanks to AI, as Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang analogized on his company\u2019s earnings call last week, investing in Nvidia is akin to investing in a company who built crucial components in nearly all steam engines in the 1700s. \u201cWe are at the beginning stages of what we refer to as the Mother of All Cycles,\u201d according to Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann, who has had a $1,400 price target for Nvidia since February, when its stock traded at below $800.\nSurprising Fact\nThis week, Huang became one of just 16 people in the world to own a fortune of over $100 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 calculations. It\u2019s a remarkable rise for Huang, a majority of whom\u2019s net worth is tied to his 3.7% stake in Nvidia, considering he was worth just $1.7 billion as of Forbes\u2019 2016 ranking of the 400 richest Americans.\n\n\nFurther ReadingForbesNvidia CEO Huang Briefly A $100 Billion Man As AI Firm Closes In On AppleBy Derek Saul\nForbesNvidia Earnings: Stock Rallies As AI Giant Reports 600% Profit Explosion, 10-For-1 Stock SplitBy Derek Saul\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

This happens as the company transitions from its Hopper AI platform to the more advanced Blackwell system. Huang dismissed concerns about a potential slowdown in demand, stating,\u00a0\n\u201cPeople want to deploy these data centers right now. They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\u201d\nSurpassing Expectations with Stellar Q1 Results\nFor the first quarter, Nvidia reported stellar results. Adjusted earnings per share reached $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, representing year-over-year increases of 461% and 262%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income was $18.1 billion for the quarter.\u00a0\nNvidia expects its revenue for the current quarter to be around $28 billion, plus or minus 2%, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations of $26.6 billion.\n\nNvidia\u2019s data center segment, crucial for AI and reliant on high-powered server farms, generated $22.6 billion or 87% of its revenue between February and April 2024. Other segments also saw growth, with gaming and visualization solutions increasing by 18% and 45%, respectively, compared to fiscal Q1 2024. However, the data center segment\u2019s growth was extraordinary, surging 427% year-over-year, as seen below.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia announced a 10-to-1 stock split, effective June 10 for shareholders as of June 7, and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.10 per share, up from $0.04. Following the earnings report, Nvidia\u2019s stock rose by as much as 6% in extended trading.\nMoreover, Huang highlighted the growing customer base for Nvidia chips beyond the major cloud service providers, mentioning companies like Meta, Tesla, and various pharmaceutical firms. He specifically pointed out the automotive industry as a significant user of Nvidia\u2019s data-center chips.\nSetting New Standards in Energy Efficiency\nNearly 75% of global carbon emissions stem from the production and consumption of energy, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels for electricity. Data centers, which currently consume 460 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, contribute about 2% to this total. However, this share is expected to nearly triple to 6% by 2030 as data centers continue to expand.\u00a0\n\nImproving energy efficiency in data centers is crucial for reducing their carbon footprint and mitigating their environmental impact. By adopting more efficient technologies and practices, data centers can play a significant role in lowering overall carbon emissions.\n\nRELEVANT: Data Centers Power Demand Fuel U.S. Utility Q1 Earnings Discussions\n\nNvidia aims to address growing concerns about AI\u2019s monetary cost and carbon footprint by highlighting Blackwell\u2019s energy efficiency.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOne expert at Microsoft has suggested that the Nvidia H100s currently in deployment will consume as much power as the entire city of Phoenix by the end of this year. What\u2019s noteworthy about the new Blackwell GPU is its power efficiency, which Nvidia is now highlighting as a key selling point.\u00a0\nTraditionally, more powerful chips have also required more energy, and Nvidia focused primarily on raw performance rather than energy efficiency. However, when unveiling the Blackwell, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized its superior processing speed, which significantly reduces power consumption during training compared to the H100 and earlier A100 chips.\u00a0\nHuang noted that training ultra-large AI models with 2,000 Blackwell GPUs would consume 4 megawatts of power over 90 days, whereas using 8,000 older GPUs for the same task would consume 15 megawatts. This reduction translates to the power consumption of 8,000 homes compared to 30,000 homes.\n\nRELATED: The Carbon Countdown: AI and Its 10 Billion Rise in Power Use\n\nTech Titans Drive Nvidia\u2019s AI Dominance\nUndeniably, Nvidia stands at the forefront of the exploding demand for AI applications, driven by major tech giants like Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet. These companies\u2019 recent management commentary underscores the significant potential for Nvidia\u2019s business expansion in the AI sector.\nTesla\u2019s ambitious plans to increase its Nvidia chip use by 140% highlight the critical role of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in training AI models for its full self-driving capabilities and upcoming robotaxi launch. This substantial investment represents a major endorsement of Nvidia\u2019s technology by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\nSimilarly, Meta\u2019s aggressive spending to bolster its AI infrastructure aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of establishing Meta as a leading AI company globally. As Meta continues to develop its large language model (LLaMA) and Meta AI chatbot, Nvidia\u2019s chips remain integral to its AI training efforts.\nMicrosoft is also experiencing surging demand for AI, outstripping its available capacity. The tech giant is investing in its own AI development using OpenAI\u2019s GPT model. However, it plans to ramp up spending to meet the growing demand, with Nvidia\u2019s chips playing a crucial role in its cloud service offerings.\nFinally, Alphabet\u2019s substantial capital expenditures in the first quarter, primarily directed towards Google Cloud and advanced AI models, further validate the importance of Nvidia\u2019s technology in powering AI-driven initiatives. While Alphabet uses its chip designs for certain AI tasks, it continues to rely on Nvidia chips to meet its cloud customers\u2019 needs.\nWhile most AI runs on renewable energy, concerns persist about water consumption for data center cooling. As AI adoption grows, renewable energy demand could outpace supply, prompting interest in expediting nuclear plant approvals, notably by Microsoft.\n\n\nREAD MORE: Could Merchant Nuclear Plants be the Savior of Power-Hungry Data Centers?\n\n\nOverall, the overwhelming demand for AI compute presents a significant opportunity for Nvidia, reflected in its robust financial performance and soaring gross margins. And with the company\u2019s discussion of the Blackwell GPU\u2019s energy efficiency, it signals that the company is starting to consider\u00a0AI\u2019s sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nWhy Geothermal is the Hot Ticket to Low-Carbon Data Centers?\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nChina Revives Its Carbon Credit Market: Price Swings & Future Outlook\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nUEC Reports Stellar $49.8M Revenue as Net-Zero Uranium Strategy Gains Momentum\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nMeta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimate Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nWhy Geothermal is the Hot Ticket to Low-Carbon Data Centers?\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nChina Revives Its Carbon Credit Market: Price Swings & Future Outlook\n\n\nMarch 17, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits  \n\nUEC Reports Stellar $49.8M Revenue as Net-Zero Uranium Strategy Gains Momentum\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence)  \n\nMeta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050\n\n\nMarch 14, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast\nChange\nYTD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATEST CARBON NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits\nCarney Scraps Carbon Tax\u2014Can Canada Reduce Emissions Without It?\n\n\nMarch 18, 2025 \n\nOn March 14, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the end of Canada\u2019s federal consumer carbon tax, effective April 1.

What he lacks is supply. In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance following the company's first quarter earnings report Wednesday, Huang pushed back against concerns the company could face a demand lull as it shifts between its current and next generation of AI chips.  \"People want to deploy these data centers right now,\" Huang said. \"They want to put our [graphics processing units] to work right now and start making money and start saving money. And so that demand is just so strong.\" Nvidia is transitioning from its current Hopper AI platform to its more advanced Blackwell system. Ahead of the company's results on Wednesday, some analysts on Wall Street had raised questions about whether some customers would be more cautious with Hopper orders ahead of the release of the more desirable Blackwell units later this year. \"Hopper demand grew throughout this quarter \u2014 after we announced Blackwell \u2014 and so that kind of tells you how much demand there is out there,\" Huang said. Huang added that demand for both platforms will outstrip supply well into next year, with the complexity of these chips also challenging the company's efforts to keep pace. \"Every component, every part of our data center, is the most complex computer the world's ever made,\" Huang said. \"And so it's sensible that almost everything is constrained.\" For the first quarter, Nvidia reported results that topped Wall Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings per share reaching $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, a 461% and 262% jump from the prior year, respectively. Non-GAAP operating income tallied $18.1 billion in the first quarter.   Nvidia's quarterly results topped expectations again on Wednesday. (Source: Company filings)   In the current quarter, Nvidia expects revenue to reach $28 billion plus or minus 2%. That\u2019s better than the $26.6 billion analysts had expected. The company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split \u2014 in which shareholders will receive 10 shares for every one share of the company they currently own \u2014 that will go into effect June 10 for shareholders as of June 7. Nvidia also joined its Big Tech peers in boosting its quarterly dividend, with shareholders now set to receive a dividend of $0.10 per share, up from $0.04. Nvidia stock rose over 9% in early trading Thursday.

Advanced Chart    Huang also discussed how Nvidia will navigate the transition from AI training, in which companies train AI models, to AI inferencing, where those same companies deploy models for customers to use. Questions have swirled about whether large-scale cloud providers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) would drop Nvidia's chips for inferencing in favor of their own offerings.   Story Continues But Huang sees Nvidia's offerings as being just as powerful for inference as they are for training.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at the company's office in Santa Clara, Calif., April 16, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)  \u00b7 ASSOCIATED PRESS\"We have a great position in inference, because inference is just a really complicated problem,\" he said.\"The software stack is complicated. The type of models that people use is complicated. The vast majority of inferencing today is done on Nvidia. And so, we expect that to continue.\"The CEO also touched on the growth the company is seeing in sales to customers beyond the major cloud service providers, saying that companies ranging from Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) to pharmaceutical firms are increasingly buying up Nvidia chips. In fact, the biggest industry using Nvidia's data center chip, excluding the cloud companies, is automotive.\"Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,\" Huang said. \"But every single car, someday we will have to have autonomous capability.\"Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance  Terms  and Privacy Policy   Privacy Dashboard   More Info  Recommended Stories   We\u02bcre unable to load stories right now. \n\n\n  Copyright \u00a9 2025 Yahoo.

which is key to its promises of full self-driving technology.Earlier this week, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that an extension to the company's Giga Texas factory would include a \"super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster\" - although in April it was revealed that the data center was behind schedule.The company is also looking to expand its data center footprint in China beyond its existing site in Singapore.

Despite a strong quarter overall for the group, not all of the companies reported revenue gains. Among the ones that did, Nvidia led the pack with total quarterly revenues of $26 billion, a 262% increase from a year ago.\u00a0The chip maker\u2019s net income rose 628% year-over-year to $14.9 billion.\u00a0\n\u201cThe next industrial revolution has begun,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a Wednesday earnings call, adding that he expected AI to \u201cbring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDive Insight:\nGartner predicts that AI software spending will surge to $297.9 billion by 2027, up from $124 billion in 2022.\u00a0\nWhile AI has been credited with boosting tech profits and stocks, analysts have been divided over whether the boom reflects a potential bubble that could burst at some point in the future.\nAll of this comes as CFOs across the broader business community are carefully weighing the potential costs, benefits and risks of investing in AI.\nAs corporate AI budgets continue to expand, finance chiefs will likely find themselves under rising pressure to demonstrate the return on investment for such expenditures, Frances Karamouzis, an analyst at Gartner,\u00a0said last week at a conference hosted by the research and advisory firm.\nThe proportion of S&P 500 companies mentioning AI on earnings calls rose to 36% in the fourth quarter of last year, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a February research note.\nThe report highlighted several companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM, that were expecting AI to produce results such as enhanced productivity, reduced costs, and improved product offerings.\nMeanwhile, a Grant Thornton survey unveiled in January found that AI topped the list of areas\u00a0cited by tech CFOs as technology-related investment priorities for 2024.\nBig tech companies, for their part,\u00a0have been locked in an AI investment race since Microsoft-backed OpenAI introduced its groundbreaking ChatGPT tool.\nNvidia stock rose 9.3% on Thursday, closing above $1,000 for the first time, according to Yahoo Finance. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split and an increased dividend.\n\u201cThe AI Revolution starts with Nvidia and in our view the AI party is just getting started with the popcorn getting ready,\u201d analysts at Wedbush Securities said in a Wednesday client note shared with CFO Dive.\nIn their most recent fiscal quarter, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta grew their revenues by double-digit percentages compared with a year ago. But Apple and Tesla saw their revenues drop by 4% and 9%\u00a0respectively.\nBig tech\u2019s heavy investments in AI received mixed reviews from Wall Street during the early part of the most recent earnings season. Microsoft and Google were rewarded with stock gains the day after their earnings reports, but Meta\u2019s stock plummeted \u2014\u00a0an outcome that analysts attributed in part to its plan to double down on AI spending as it also braced for slowing sales.\nComing into the latest earnings season, investors were initially nervous, with questions about whether the AI boom had run too far, potentially leaving Microsoft, Nvidia and other big tech companies at risk of being unable to meet Wall Street\u2019s high expectations, according to a Bloomberg report. \n\u201cA month later, most of those concerns have been put to rest with the S&P 500 Index sitting at an all-time high on the back of strong corporate profits,\u201d the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npurchase licensing rights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nStrategy & Operations, \nFinancial Reporting, \nTechnology, \nLeadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCFO Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Newsletter:\n\n\nDaily Dive\nM-F\n\n\n\nSelect Newsletter:\n\n\nTech Weekly\nEvery Tuesday\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

These changes will perhaps be as significant to the world as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, both of which had drastic economic consequences.\nAlthough the exact progression and timing of these changes are unpredictable, one thing is clear: The AI wave will not be possible without advancements in \u2013 and a stable supply of \u2013 hardware and software generally, and silicon specifically. The complexity of semiconductor design and manufacturing combined with rapid innovation and the vulnerability of the supply chain creates unique and challenging dynamics that in our view are reshaping leadership in the semiconductor industry.\nOur forecast shows that the combined revenues of: 1) companies that supply manufacturing equipment, components and software to build fabrication facilities; 2) chip manufacturers; and 3) chip and AI software designers will approach $1T this decade. Our research suggests that four companies, Nvidia Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., will account for almost half of that trillion-dollar opportunity.\nIn this Breaking Analysis, we bring in theCUBE Research analyst emeritus David Floyer to quantify and forecast the dynamic semiconductor ecosystem. We compare market shares from 2010 with those of 2023 and provide a five-year outlook for more than a dozen of the top players in the industry. We also provide a view of where we see the overall market headed, our assumptions for the market and the top players, which firms we see winning and losing and why, with a bit of survey data from Enterprise Technology Research.\nWe\u2019ll also address the following five items:\n\nHow sustainable is Nvidia\u2019s moat?\nWhat\u2019s the impact of competition on Nvidia, including from hyperscalers, Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and others?\nThe challenges faced by two companies that both design and manufacture semiconductors \u2013 Intel and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.\nWhat the opportunities at the edge mean for firms and competition.\nRisks to our scenarios including geopolitical, technological and energy risks.\n\n\n\n\nAI capturing budget momentum\nLet\u2019s start with the macro impact that the generative AI awakening has had on information technology spending in the last two years. The data below from ETR shows the 19 sectors the company tracks each quarter. The vertical axis is spending velocity or Net Score and the horizontal plane is the Pervasion, or penetration of the sector within the survey.\nWe\u2019ve shown this many times before, but note where AI was one month prior to ChatGPT\u2019s launch in the October 2022 survey. It dropped just below the 40% magic line that month and since then has been up and to the right. Consequently, other sectors have been suppressed. As we\u2019ve reported, 42% of customers indicate they\u2019re funding AI by stealing from other budgets. And we know that generally enterprise AI return on investment is coming in small productivity wins at this time and for most organizations is not yet self-funding.\n\n\n\nThe point is that AI is consuming not only the conversation but also the spending momentum.\nWe believe there are three significant impacts for all organizations.\n\nThe first is across the board\u00a0productivity gains. Our expectation is that significant adopters of AI will initially see initially 20% and eventually up to 50% improvements over the next few years.\nSecond\u00a0quality of service. For example, a contact center representative should be able to answer any customer or prospects question correctly, accurately and immediately. Or the customer can self-serve the answer on the company\u2019s website by voice in the language of their choice.\nPerhaps the most important value of AI to organizations is the potential\u00a0automation of business processes. Specifically, the elimination of people within a business processes that leads to a simplification of the business processes and the company as a whole.\n\nAs such, our guidance to clients is a combination of all three is ideal. If you are not planning for a tenfold productivity improvement over the next five to 10 years, there are startups and competitors that will and risk taking your business.\nNvidia\u2019s moat is wide and deep\nOK, let\u2019s cut right to the chase. Nvidia momentum is simply remarkable and has caught the attention of everyone in the industry. The pace of innovation coming out of the AI ecosystem generally and Nvidia specifically is astounding. Here\u2019s a diagram that underscores the new era in computing that we\u2019re in, catalyzed by large language models and the AI breakthroughs.\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the teraflop progression Nvidia has made since 2016. We\u2019ve overlaid a depiction of the Moore\u2019s Law progression. The comparison is remarkable with Nvidia demonstrating a 1000-times improvement in parallel/matrix computing (what Nvidia calls accelerated computing) in eight years versus a 100-times improvement from Moore\u2019s Law in a decade.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that in this episode where we\u2019re forecasting the semiconductor industry ecosystem and we\u2019re taking liberties with the scope. And by that we mean we\u2019re modeling Nvidia as a full platform solution and a company that is building end-to-end AI data centers \u2013 what it calls the AI Factory. And its selling that capability through partners.\nOne of the key aspects of Nvidia\u2019s moat is it builds entire AI systems and then disaggregate and sell them in pieces. As such, when it sells AI offerings, be they chips, networking, software and the like, it knows where the bottlenecks are and can assist customers in fine-tuning their architectures.\nNvidia\u2019s moat is deep and wide in our view. It has an ecosystem and are driving innovation hard. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has announced that there\u2019s another big chip behind Blackwell \u2013 no surprise \u2013 and it\u2019s on a one-year \u201ccadence\u201drhythm\u201d for systems and networking and the new systems will run CUDA. Nvidia claims to be \u201call-in\u201d on Ethernet, the company will continue to extend NVLink for homogenous AI Factories, and Infiniband\u2019s roadmap continues.\nHuang\u2019s claim and bet is the more you spend with Nvidia, the more you save and the more revenue you can drive.\nIn addition:\n\nWe think Nvidia\u2019s performance gains will continue. It means we\u2019ll see\u00a01 million teraflops\u00a0in five years time.\nBut the important thing is Nvidia is not just a chip, it\u2019s an\u00a0entire AI platform. It has specialized graphics processing units, central processing units, networking, cooling and software \u2013 it\u2019s a complete systems software. CUDA is by far the best software in the industry. It\u2019s the key AI software platform.\nNvidia can deliver an entire AI data center. Nothing has been introduced that\u2019s this\u00a0revolutionary\u00a0since IBM introduced the System 360 in 1964, which changed the computer industry.\n\nIn addition, the goal is to crank it up and introduce a new system every year. In our opinion, the value to the users, to hyperscalers and to anyone using these technologies is so high that, combined with the cost of creating alternatives, it means to us that for at least the next five years, Nvidia will be the dominant supplier in the AI data center.\nA trillion-dollar semiconductor ecosystem\nLet\u2019s get to the meat of this research and our five-year outlook for the ecosystem. The table below lays out how we see the semiconductor industry evolving. In the first column we show the players in the ecosystem comprising the chip designers such as Qualcomm, the chip manufacturers such as TSMC, three leading firms that do both \u2014\u00a0 Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc., equipment manufacturers such as ASML Holding NV and Applied Materials Inc., and software providers such as Cadence Design Systems Inc., which is in the \u201cother\u201d category.\nOf course we\u2019re also including Nvidia, which we believe has become and will continue to be the most important player in the market. Again we\u2019ve pushed the envelope a bit in terms of the forecast and are forecasting Nvidia\u2019s entire revenue stream beyond just chips.\n\nFor each company we\u2019re showing their related revenue in 2010, 2023 and our forecast for each firm in 2028 with a CAGR for the relevant time period.\nMethodology\nWe ingested a series of relevant financial data for each firm and we combined this data with our fundamental assumptions to create a top down model of the industry as we describe here. We tested this data with a two external data points and added a third dimension, including:\u00a0 1) company strategic forecasts based on their long-term financial frameworks; 2) inputs from various financial analysts that have made long-term projections for these companies; and 3) applying our own assumptions about how we see the market playing out.\nWe\u2019ll share that our assumptions and the resulting forecasts deviate quite widely from generally accepted market narratives. In particular, the broad consensus when you take into account the publicly available data essential says that everyone wins and the disruption to existing firms will be modest. We don\u2019t see it this way. Rather, we forecast a dramatic shift to matrix computing or so-called accelerated computing; and we see meaningful spending shifts causing market dislocation, particularly to traditional x86 markets.\nKey findings\nThe high-level findings in our market assessment are as follows:\n\nThe global semi ecosystem with our expanded scope, surpasses\u00a0$900 billion by 2028\u00a0and will approximate $1 trillion by 2030.\nWe forecast a\u00a010% compound annual growth rate\u00a0from 2023 to 2028.\nThere is a\u00a0massive market shift\u00a0away from general-purpose x86 toward parallel AI computing architectures or matrix computing\u00a0to support AI.\nFour companies will account for approximately 40% of the revenue in this forecast by 2028:\u00a0Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm.\nSamsung and Intel\u00a0are bucking the trend by vertically integrating design and manufacturing and are facing similar challenges.\nAI PCs will cause PC lifecycles to shorten. They will go mainstream and not only participate in a Windows refresh but will change the dynamics of the useful life of PCs.\nArm-based designs\u00a0dominate the market volume and will confer significant cost advantages to those firms up the Arm curve\nHigh bandwidth memory or HBM drives unprecedented demand for memory suppliers and creates a tailwind for those companies that can produce them.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the data in more detail by company, sorted by our 2028 projections in descending order. We\u2019ll show the company, our projected CAGR and our revenue forecast for 2028.\nNvidia:\u00a025% CAGR, $160B\nIn our view, Nvidia essentially has a monopoly somewhat similar to Wintel\u2019s duopoly of the 1990s with the core GPU dominance and the AI operating system all within in the same company. We believe Nvidia\u2019s growth rate will actually accelerate as it penetrates new markets and will surpass $160 billion in revenue by 2028.\nImportantly, we\u2019re including more than just chips in this forecast. Specifically, we\u2019re assuming Nvidia\u2019s full platform and portfolio revenue; and the assumption is that Nvidia\u2019s continues to execute across its portfolio on a rapid cadence.\nNvidia has executed brilliantly. It has bet on very large chips and invested in GPUs, CPUs, networking and software, offering a complete solution and a complete data center that can be disaggregated. Our assumption and belief is Nvidia will sustain this cadence for at least the next five years.\nTSMC: 14% CAGR, $135B\nTSM has become the go-to manufacturer for advanced chips. We have TSMC almost doubling in size over the next five years. Our core assumption is that volume economics will confer major strategic advantage to TSM and it will remain the world\u2019s No. 1 foundry by far.\nIt\u2019s important to note how TSMC is investing. The company just announced the A16, 1.6nm process targeted for 2026. We believe this will be a significant milestone in its manufacturing, with nanosheet transistors and the backside power delivery. TSMC calls this Super Power Rail. These innovations in our view are industry-leading and the company\u2019s track record of execution and delivering volume at high yields will allow it to maintain leadership.\nBroadcom Semiconductor:\u00a010% CAGR, $58B\nNext on the list is Broadcom and we\u2019re only including its semiconductor revenue. As such we think that though the company\u2019s CAGR slows to 10%, it\u2019s really because in 2010 it was very small. Much of Broadcom\u2019s 2023 revenue was dispersed in our model under the \u201cother\u201d category.\nBroadcom has done a remarkable job through acquisitions and engineering. It doesn\u2019t compete head-on with Nvidia in GPUs, although it is a major provider of silicon and AI chip IP for\u00a0Google LLC, Meta Platforms Inc. and we think ByteDance Ltd.\u00a0via its custom silicon group. We see Broadcom\u2019s semiconductor business growing at a CAGR of 10% over the next five years, taking the division to 1.6 times its current size. It solves really difficult problems to connect all the GPUs, CPUs, NPUs, accelerators and high-bandwidth memories together. It is uniquely positioned to continue to win in the market. Broadcom plays in virtually all sectors, consumer, enterprise, mobile, cloud, edge.\nBroadcom in our view is a very well-positioned and well-run company. Its focus particularly on networking is vital. High-speed networking of all types is going to be absolutely essential for AI processing and it\u2019s entrenched in this market. In particular, it\u2019s very well set up with major internet players that will be AI leaders. As such, Broadcom has early visibility on the most critical market trends.\nQualcomm: 9% CAGR, $55B\nQualcomm is very well-positioned both in mobile and now in AI PCs. We see it getting a huge tailwind from the recently introduced Windows AI PC stack from Microsoft. We have Qualcomm on a similar trajectory as Broadcom in terms of its growth. Essentially, Microsoft, with its Windows Copilot in release 11, is following Apple Inc.\u2019s moves from several years ago and that will be a big benefit for Qualcomm, which provides core silicon for AI PCs. This is more bad news for x86-based PCs.\nMicrosoft announced full support for Arm-based PCs based on Qualcomm. Now Dell, Lenovo and others have announced Arm-based PCs and suddenly you\u2019ve got a whole plethora of these initiatives and they\u2019re selling them on the basis of improved performance and a 24-hour battery life going directly after Intel\u2019s PC installed base.\nSo you can see our forecast indicates that the four companies at the top, Nvidia, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm, comprise around 45% of a $900 billion-plus market by 2028.\nIntel: 2% CAGR, $54B\nWe\u2019re forecasting Intel\u2019s Foundry revenue to comprise about $22 billion of a $54 billion business in 2028. So unlike many, we\u2019re forecasting no growth for Intel over the time period. We see the rise in foundry revenue unable to offset the decline in x86. Combined with our assumption that AMD continues to gain share in x86 markets, we have Intel data center and client revenue dropping from $45 billion in 2023 to $26 billion in 2028.\nIntel is late with support for AI PCs and we\u2019re projecting a 12- to 18-month delay in its 14A process, which is its big bet. It combines gate-all-around technology, what it calls RibbonFET, and backside power delivery, which Intel refers to as Power Via. The company hopes to be the first to use High NA EUV technology, which combined with these other innovations is extremely bold, but also likely to be delayed. Hence our assumption that 14A gets pushed.\nIntel needs all three of these innovations to be successful and differentiate from the rest of the industry. We believe Intel has a very good chance of executing on two of the three simultaneously, but even that is risky. Our assumption is Intel\u2019s 14A gets to volume production and high yields in 2028 (best case) or 2029 (likely case) but perhaps even 2030 (worst case).\nThe key to understanding Intel, in our view, is that it has lost the volume lead. Apple and TSMC have taken the lead and its Arm-based phones and PCs have given it a significant learning curve moat in our view, to Intel\u2019s detriment.\nIf, however, Intel is able to succeed and deliver 14A in volume production as it plans in 2026 and can follow with its 10A 1nm node in late 2027, then our forecasts will be incorrect and Intel will in a much better position than we project.\nASML: 7% CAGR, $41B\nASML has unique differentiation that is going to remain unmatched. Essentially we see ASML as a monopoly that\u2019s going to continue and it will be able to command whatever pricing it wants.\nSK Hynix: 10% CAGR, $40B\nHigh-bandwidth memory has become a new enabler for AI. It\u2019s in high demand and short supply and that is going to propel SK Hynix. We have SK Hynix growth actually accelerating with revenue growing from $25 billion today to $40 billion by 2028. High-speed memory is incredibly important and the company has multiple options in this space.\nSamsung Semiconductor: -1% CAGR, $38B\nWe think Samsung is going to struggle to get its advanced process working. We think it\u2019s going to continue to face challenges and we think that constricts volumes and puts them in a cost dilemma. We\u2019ve got Samsung basically flat from its $40 billion today.\nIntel has said that it intends to be the No. 2 foundry by 2030. Given Samsung\u2019s struggles, we think it is the right target for Intel. It\u2019s just a matter as to whether Intel can get there. So, in that sense going after Samsung is the right move.\nAMD: 10% CAGR, $37B\nCEO Lisa Su has done an amazing job with this company. A key turning point was when AMD shed its fabs, despite co-founder Jerry Sanders once famously remarking, \u201cReal men have fabs.\u201d That didn\u2019t really prove out for AMD in the long run. It took several years for the company to get back on track, but its persistence has paid off.\nAMD is still very much tied still to x86. By 2028, the end of our forecast period, we still have 45% of AMD\u2019s revenue coming from x86, which puts downward pressure on a big part of the company\u2019s total available market. The good news is our assumptions call for AMD to continue to steal share from Intel and at the same time make progress in AI hardware.\nOf course, Intel\u2019s going to fight like crazy for its x86 data center share, but we\u2019re more sanguine on AMD\u2019s outlook as a chip designer. It\u2019s not saddled by foundry, and though that x86 pressure is a negative, we believe AMD will continue to take share. It is just faster to market and actually has a quality product. For example, Oracle Corp. has just gone all AMD-based chips for their new Exadata systems, which was a big win for AMD.\nApplied Materials: 6% CAGR, $35B\nWe think Applied Materials continues to execute. It\u2019s in a really good position. It has more competition than does ASML, but we\u2019ve got it doing pretty well here, growing from $27 billion in 2023 to $35 billion with a 6% CAGR. We\u2019re basically forecasting ASML, SK Hynix, Samsung, AMD and AMAT all around that $35 billion to $40 billion range.\nApple semiconductor value: 12% CAGR, $33B\nEssentially what we\u2019ve done here is model the value contribution within Apple\u2019s hardware to the silicon and made some assumptions around its value contribution in the chain. We saw that Apple, based on our assumptions, grew at a 15% CAGR from 2010 to 2023 and we\u2019ve got it at 12% from 2023 to 2028. We\u2019re assuming a $33 billion contribution from silicon.\nThere have been ongoing reports that Apple\u2019s going to sell silicon as a merchant supplier. We do not make that assumption in our figures. Nonetheless, Apple getting into the business of manufacturing its own chips was profound. It started with its A series in smartphones and now of course the M series in its newest laptops and iPads. It was the first to ship neural processing units both in iPhone and in PCs. Now it has to make major step-up as the AI PC competition heats up.\nApple quietly led the AI PC wave. It introduced large chips many years ago on iPhones and integrated the CPUs, NPUs and GPUs on the same chip. It has a large shared SRAM, which architecturally is a leading example and well-positioned for AI. Apple has a proven track record in silicon, for example evolving its M series, M1, M2, M3 and and now M4.\nWe believe Apple is a leader in designing silicon architectures required to go into AI and we assume it will quickly respond to the Qualcomm AI PC trend. In our view, Apple is a main reason why Microsoft is pushing support for Arm-based designs, because it was under pressure from Apple.\nMicron: 14% CAGR, $31B\nWe believe Micron can accelerate its growth rate, propelled by high-bandwidth memory. Similar to SK Hynix, demand is way outstripping supply for Micron\u2019s HBM. Micron has executed very well. We see an acceleration in their CAGR to 14% and nearly doubling revenue by 2028 from $16 billion in 2023 to $31 billion. Micron not only designs chips, it has been a successful manufacturer for years.\nHyperscaler silicon \u2014 AWS, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Alibaba, ByteDance: 15% CAGR, $12B\nWe grouped hyperscaler cloud providers into a single category. Hyperscalers design their own silicon and partner with merchant suppliers such as Broadcom and others. Our forecast for hyperscalers excludes Broadcom\u2019s contribution of custom chips, for example. We\u2019re not double counting here.\nWe think hyperscaler general-purpose, training and inference chips will be used for cost-sensitive applications such as inferencing at the edge. We assume they\u2019re not going to keep pace with Nvidia at the high end, but they will get their fair share. We assume AWS Graviton accounted for about 20% of AWS workloads in 2023. Inferentia and Trainium were a smaller portion of AI workloads in 2023, as were the counterparts at Google and Microsoft. We assume a healthy contribution from hyperscalers, but they will not be a dominant factor in terms of disrupting Nvidia in our view.\nHyperscalers are introducing Nvidia IP. They really have to take Nvidia because they can\u2019t make a comparable platform themselves. We assume it\u2019s going to be cheaper for the next five years and as such they will continue to be large customers of Nvidia.\nOther silicon ecosystem players: 4% CAGR, $175B\nOther includes a long tail of suppliers across the value chain. You have Texas Instruments, GlobalFoundries, Chinese players such as Yangtze, CXMT, startups such as Cerebras, and many more.\nWe assume in our forecast that China doesn\u2019t invade Taiwan and that hot wars don\u2019t completely disrupt the market. And it also assumes that the AI PC market generally follows Apple\u2019s trends from x86 to Arm. We show x86 at about 13% of the market revenue in 2010 dropping to 11% in 2023. And it\u2019s projected to be 5% in 2028.\nVisualizing the leaders \u2013 2010 to 2028\nHere\u2019s a visual of what we just went through. In the interest of time, we\u2019ll just say that the two companies bucking the trend among the leaders are Intel and Samsung. Micron is in a different business and has uniquely figured out the combined model. And AI is brining new investment to a market that was always considered risky by investors. News flash: It still is.\n\n\n\nAI PCs will shorten lifecycles\nHere\u2019s our forecast for PCs going back to 2009. When PC volumes peaked in 2011, that was the beginning of Intel\u2019s descent from the mountaintop, even though most people didn\u2019t see it.\u00a0David Floyer made the call in 2013. And the key points here are:\n\nConsumer volumes from the iPhone are what enabled innovation in AI PCs.\nSpecifically the first true inference came out in 2017 with Apple using neural processing units \u2013 NPUs \u2013 to do facial recognition and that innovation led to the first NPUs in laptops and the early example of AI PCs.\nWhile PC volumes picked up during COVID, they\u2019ve been constricting. But we believe AI PCs are a game-changer.\nMicrosoft just reset the windows stack for AI around Arm \u2013 WinArm \u2013 following Apple\u2019s moves. PC makers such as Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. are adopting and Qualcomm is seizing the day. And you can see in the green below what we think it means for AI PCs powered by Arm and what happens to x86 PCs \u2013 it follows the Apple path. Not as severe but pretty much a managed-decline market.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we forecast a surge in PC volumes, it is important to understand that this does not signal a return to the dominance once enjoyed by PC chip manufacturers like Intel. The landscape is now heavily influenced by Arm-based chips, whose wafer volumes are ten times that of x86. Companies such as Nvidia, Apple and Tesla recognized this shift early and have leveraged Wright\u2019s Law to gain significant cost and time-to-market advantages in Arm-based chip design and manufacturing.\nThis shift underscores the increasing value of Arm technology in reducing design costs and highlights the challenges faced by x86. The market dynamics have fundamentally changed, and Arm\u2019s advancements have made it a dominant force, fundamentally altering the competitive landscape.\nFinal thoughts on key topics\nLet\u2019s close on some of the key issues we haven\u2019t hit.\n\n\n\nThe future of AI and its market dynamics are evolving rapidly, with significant implications for key players and emerging technologies. Our analysis highlights the pivotal trends and forecasts that will shape the AI landscape over the next decade, focusing on AI inference at the edge, energy needs, geopolitical risks and the potential shifts in semiconductor manufacturing.\nKey points\n\nAI inference at the edge:\n\nBy 2034, 80% of AI spending is projected to be on inference at the edge.\nThis workload is expected to dominate the AI market.\nWhile Nvidia currently holds a strong position in AI inference, driven largely by ChatGPT, the competitive landscape for high-volume, low-cost, low-power inference at the edge remains wide open and will challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominance.\n\n\nEnergy needs:\n\nFuture energy requirements will drive the adoption of nuclear, solar, wind and large local batteries.\nInnovative energy solutions will be critical to support the growing AI infrastructure.\nLocal power generation will be an emerging trend.\n\n\nGeopolitical risks:\n\nPotential disruptions from geopolitical tensions, particularly involving China and Taiwan, pose significant risks.\nOur forecast assumes a frictionless environment, but there\u2019s a 35% to 40% probability of supply chain disruptions affecting the market within our forecast period.\n\n\nIntel foundry and semiconductor innovations:\n\nIntel\u2019s future positioning depends on the successful implementation of gate-all-around, backside power and NA EUV technologies by 2026-2027.\nAchieving high yields in these areas could significantly enhance Intel\u2019s competitiveness by the 2030s and alter our scenario for the company.\n\n\nMarket disruptors:\n\nWell-funded startups and major mergers and acquisitions by hyperscalers could introduce alternative approaches.\nDespite potential disruptions, Nvidia and the other three silicon giants with momentum \u2013 TSM, Broadcom and Qualcomm \u2013 are expected to maintain their velocity.\n\n\n\nBottom line\nThe AI market is set for significant transformation, with AI inference at the edge poised to become the dominant workload. Energy innovations and geopolitical stability are crucial for sustaining this growth. Though Nvidia currently leads, the competitive landscape remains fluid, with potential shifts driven by technological advancements and market disruptors. Our analysis underscores the need to monitor these developments closely as they will shape the future of AI.\nAs always, we\u2019ll be watching.\nHow do you see the market playing out over the next five years?

Cal.DOCKET: Nos. 4:24-cv-02655 and 3:24-cv-2653Four prominent authors filed putative class actions against software companies Nvidia Corp. and Databricks Inc., joining a parade of creators suing for copyright infringement over inputs used to train generative AI models.Novelist Andre Dubus III and journalist and nonfiction writer Susan Orlean alleged Nvidia\u2019s NeMo Megatron models were trained by copying their and others\u2019 work in a complaint filed Thursday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Fiction authors Rebecca Makkai and Jason Reynolds filed a nearly-identical suit against Databricks Inc. over its MosaicML model in the same court Thursday.The claims made by the authors in both suits mirror those made within the past week by newspapers against OpenAI and a putative class of artists and photographers against Google LLC, among other suits. The cases challenge the core premise of training AI large language models with millions-to-billions of inputs from large datasets, much of it potentially copyrighted works, to learn to mimic human creativity.The suits are also not the first putative class actions against Nvidia and Databricks for their AI models. Authors Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene and Stewart O\u2019Nan filed lawsuits against the two companies in March.\u201cWe respect the rights of all content creators and believe we created our models in full compliance with copyright law,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement.Databricks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AI developers have argued that having models merely train on the vast quantity of works, each providing infinitesimal independent influence on outputs, constitutes fair use. OpenAI Inc. has claimed fair use and said it would be impossible to create useful AI tools without them, emphasizing it lets creators opt out.But creators have balked at the assertion, claiming that the developers copy and use their works for free, relying on creators\u2019 work to then produce expressive content that competes with them.The answers to the thorny legal questions around AI\u2019s use of copyrighted material will dramatically affect the viability of generative AI models given the shear volume of works needed to effectively train AI and the fact that any work with minimal creativity and originality would be protected.While works gain protection upon creation, Dubus, Olrean, Makkai and Reynolds focus on authors with registered copyrights in books in a training dataset that Nvidia and Databricks has allegedly admitted copying to train its NeMo Megatron models. One part of the dataset used to train the models comprises 108 gigabytes of data pulled from Bibliotik, a \u201cshadow library\u201d that hosts and distributed unlicensed copyright materials, according to the complaint. Shawn Presser, creator of Bibliotik, has confirmed in public statements that it contains nearly 200,000 books. DiCello Levitt LLP represents the authors against both Nvidia and Databricks. Cafferty Clobes Meriwether & Sprengel LLP also represent Makkai and Reynolds.Dubus v. Nvidia Corp., N.D. Cal., No. 24-2655, Complaint 5/2/24 and Makkai v. Databricks Inc., N.D. Cal., No. 24-2653, Complaint 5/2/24.

Using the latest R555 drivers, NVIDIA's RTX GPUs and AI PC platforms now offer up to 3x faster AI performance with ONNX Runtime (ORT) and DirectML. These two tools are used to run AI models locally on Windows PCs.\n\nIn addition to that, WebNN has also been accelerated with RTX via DirectML. This is an application programming interface for web developers to deploy new AI models. Microsoft is working with NVIDIA to further accelerate RTX GPU performance whilst adding DirectML support on PyTorch. Following is a full list of capabilities that the new R555 drivers offer for GeForce RTX GPUs and RTX PCs:\n\nSupport for DQ-GEMM metacommand to handle INT4 weight-only quantization for LLMs\nNew RMSNorm normalization methods for Llama 2, Llama 3, Mistral and Phi-3 models\nGroup and multi-query attention mechanisms, and sliding window attention to support Mistral\nIn-place KV updates to improve attention performance\nSupport for GEMM of non-multiple-of-8 tensors to improve context phase performance\n\nImage Source: NVIDIA\nIn performance benchmarks of ORT, a generative AI extension released by Microsoft, NVIDIA shows gains across the board in both INT4 and FP16 data types. The performance improvements are up to 3x thanks to the optimization techniques added within these extensions for LLMs such as Phi-3, Llama 3, Gemma, and Mistral.\nBesides these enhancements, NVIDIA has been leading the charge in the consumer AI PC space with its powerful TensorRT and TensorRT-LLM suite. The company also offers a diverse range of solutions powered by its AI hardware incorporated within its GPUs such as Tensor Cores.\nThese solutions include the game-changing DLSS Super Resolution technology, NVIDIA ACE, RTX Remix, Omniverse, Broadcast, RTX Video, and several other technologies. NVIDIA's GPUs offer up to 1300 TOPS of AI compute which are miles ahead of the fastest chips coming out this year which are only expected to top 100 TOPS. Furthermore, these PCs will come equipped with the latest NVIDIA RTX GPUs, further fueling the RTX AI PC platform and pushing the AI segment further in the consumer space.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\nGerman Retailer Receives New Stock of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 & RTX 5070 Ti At Somewhat Higher Prices Than MSRP\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Planning Entry-Level GeForce RTX 5050 8 GB GPU, RTX 5060 8 GB Hits Retail In April\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 12 GB Graphics Card Launched \u2013 Will The $549 US MSRP Models Be Available Anywhere?\n\nHassan Mujtaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Rolls Out GeForce Driver 572.60 To Fix Black Screen Issues Related To RTX 50 Series GPUs\n\nSarfraz Khan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\n\nSamsung Rumored To Have Cancelled Its Next-Generation 1.4nm Manufacturing Process, Hinting At More Problems Plaguing The Company\u2019s Foundry Business\n\n\n\n116\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nApple Would Have Been Successful In Making The iPhone 17 Air Completely \u2018Portless\u2019 If The EU Regulations Did Not Get In The Way, Second Prototype Featured A Bigger Display\n\n\n\n71\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD Has Reportedly Enforced a \u201cBiased Distribution\u201d of the RX 9070 Series Among AIBs; ASUS, XFX & PowerColor Receive a Much Higher Allocation\n\n\n\n66\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 \u201cStrix Halo\u201d APU Is Over 3x Faster Than RTX 5080 In DeepSeek R1 AI Benchmarks\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s 12-Core, 24-Thread Ryzen 9 9900X3D Is The Company\u2019s Only Gaming-Focused Desktop CPU That Is Available At Its MSRP Of $599 On Amazon, Remaining SKUs Listed At Inflated Prices\n\n\n\n49\nActive Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Discussions\n\n\nBolt Graphics Makes Bold Claims; Introduces Zeus With Up To 10 Times The Rendering Performance Of RTX 5090 GPU\n\n\n\n1522\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Crushes Intel In February CPU Sales; Ryzen 7 9800X3D Still At The Top Spot On Amazon With 8000+ Units Shipped\n\n\n\n1462\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Says RDNA 4 \u201cRadeon RX 9070\u201d Launch Has Been \u201cUnprecedented\u201d, Talks Dual 3D V-Cache CCDs & Ryzen CPUs Beyond 16 Cores\n\n\n\n1279\nComments\n\n\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Dies After Enabling EXPO, User Blames It On MSI X870E Tomahawk WiFi\n\n\n\n1154\nComments\n\n\n\nASUS Increases Its Radeon RX 9070 Series And RTX 5090 Prices: Prime RX 9070 XT Model Now Costs $719 While RTX 5090 Starts At $2759\n\n\n\n1145\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nHardware\nGaming\nMobile\nFinance\nSoftware\nSecurity\nWeb\n\n\n\nSections\n\nDeals\nReviews\nVideos\nHow To's\nAnalysis\nExclusives\nInterviews\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\nAdvertise with Us\nContact\nTip Us\nCareers\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy & Cookies Policy\nEthics Statements\nAppeal Moderation\n\n\n\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\n\n\n\nWhen the\u00a0first rumors about AMD's and Nvidia's plans to develop Arm-based processors for PCs\u00a0emerged last year, we had certain doubts about such intentions given the datacenter focus of these companies. But this week, Michael Dell, chief executive of Dell, and Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, somewhat confirmed the information. It now looks like the green company will come up with its processor for 'AI PCs' as soon as next year; however, there's a catch.\u00a0When Bloomberg\u00a0asked about Nvidia's place in the emerging AI PC segment during a group interview, Michael Dell told Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow to 'come back next year,' while Jensen Huang responded 'exactly.' Such answers could be interpreted as confirmation of Nvidia's plans to address the upcoming Windows-on-Arm AI PC market with its own processors. While this is not going to be precisely a blue ocean market, with around 280 million PCs sold every year, this market is hard to ignore.\u00a0After all, Nvidia has everything it needs to build system-on-chips for PCs, including Arm general-purpose cores, GeForce graphics processors, Tensor cores for AI, and various other hardware. With SoCs aimed at PCs, Nvidia could address other adjacent markets, such as game consoles and perhaps embedded devices that need AI capabilities on the edge.\u00a0Speaking of Nvidia-accelerated AI capabilities, it is necessary to note that even today, multiple applications that take advantage of artificial intelligence can be accelerated with contemporary Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs. From this point of view, Nvidia has already enabled AI experience on tens of millions of PCs featuring its latest GeForce RTX 30 and 40 series, which are shipped every quarter.\u00a0\"All of our GPUs have the same Tensor cores that are running on H100 in the cloud,\" said Huang. \"Every one of our GPUs uses AI to the work. AI will transform gaming. All of the nonplayer character will be chatbots. Creating world will be easier. Instead of instruction driven computing, it [is going to be] intention driven computing, so it will be easier to write programs.\"\u00a0We should note that Nvidia has not confirmed its return to the market of Windows PCs with its own processors just yet. After all, the company could address this market by licensing its IP to third partners, which would reduce risks and increase profit margins but still ensure that Nvidia gets its piece of the pie.\u00a0Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more CPUs News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (11)\n\n\n\nAnton ShilovSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterAnton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom\u2019s Hardware.

It would not have to be large to adequately supplement a desktop chip that doesn't have a large enough NPU.\n\nEdit: Doesn't Raptor Lake have support for some mysterious AI M.2 that never materialized? It might have been some premature preparation for AI Windows.\n\nOn a related note I'm finding the intrusiveness of Microsoft Copilot far more aggravating than any Windows ads. It pops up far too much and sometimes makes my pc feel like my OS is some free phone app. I would pay a fee to get a \"premium\" CPU or motherboard that lacks the NPU necessary to fuel these interruptions for services I have no desire to use.\n\n\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, some details emerged from that interview.\n\nNVIDIA might leverage a 3nm process node, reportedly either Intel or TSMC, and an advanced packaging solution to bring Arm-based Cortex X5 BlackHawk CPU cores & the Blackwell RTX GPU cores together.\n\nIt's plausible that NVIDIA would use the Cortex X5 BlackHawk CPU cores since they are reportedly partnering with MediaTek to create these SOCs.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Nvidia just made $14 billion worth of profit in a single quarter thanks to AI chips, and it\u2019s hitting the gas from here on out: Nvidia will now design new chips every year instead of once every two years, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\u201cI can announce that after Blackwell, there\u2019s another chip. We\u2019re on a one-year rhythm,\u201d Huang just said on the company\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call.Until now, Nvidia\u2019s produced a new architecture roughly once every two years \u2014 revealing Ampere in 2020, Hopper in 2022, and Blackwell in 2024, for example.(The industry darling H100 AI chip was Hopper, and the B200 is Blackwell, though those same architectures are used in gaming and creator GPUs as well.)But analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported earlier this month that the next architecture \u201cRubin\u201d is coming in 2025, giving us an R100 AI GPU as soon as next year, and Huang\u2019s comments suggest that report might be on the money.Huang says Nvidia will accelerate every other kind of chip it makes to match that cadence, too. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take them all forward at a very fast clip.\u201d\u201cNew CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches... a mountain of chips are coming,\u201d he says.Earlier on the call, when an analyst asked him to explain how the recent Blackwell GPUs would ramp while Hopper GPUs are still selling well, Huang explained that Nvidia\u2019s new generations of AI GPUs are electrically and mechanically backward-compatible and run the same software. Customers will \u201ceasily transition from H100 to H200 to B100\u201d in their existing data centers, he says.Huang also shared a couple of his sales pitches on the call by way of explaining the incredible demand for Nvidia\u2019s AI GPUs:We expect demand to outstrip supply for some time, as we transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everyone\u2019s anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they\u2019re saving money and making money and they would like to do that as soon as possible.He also has a FOMO argument that made me smile:The next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI, and the second one after that gets to announce something that\u2019s 0.3 percent better. Do you want to be the company delivering groundbreaking AI, or the company, you know, delivering 0.3 percent better?Nvidia\u2019s CFO interestingly says that automotive will be its \u201clargest enterprise vertical within data center this year,\u201d pointing to how Tesla purchased 35,000 H100 GPUs to train its \u201cfull-self driving\u201d system, while \u201cconsumer internet companies\u201d like Meta will continue to be a \u201cstrong growth vertical,\u201d too.Some customers have purchased or plan to purchase over 100,000 of Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs \u2014 Meta plans to have over 350,000 of them in operation by the end of the year.See More: AINewsNvidiaTechMore in this streamSee allNvidia announces Blackwell Ultra GB300 and Vera Rubin, its next AI \u2018superchips\u2019Sean Hollister10 minutes agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleIntel is reportedly testing its 18A process again.Umar ShakirMar 3CommentsComment Icon BubbleNvidia\u2019s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, will be unveiled next month.Sean HollisterFeb 26CommentsComment Icon BubbleMost PopularMost PopularMark Rober\u2019s Tesla video was more than a little weirdAlphabet spins off Starlink competitor TaaraGoogle has a fix for all of the broken ChromecastsThe iPhone 17 Air makes other models look chunky in new leaked dummy shotsPixel 9A leaks in review videos before it\u2019s even announcedInstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Reportedly, the Huawei Ascend 910B is roughly 10% faster in AI workloads than Nvidia's top-end, sanctions-legal H20.These performance issues, combined with Nvidia's abundant supply and sanctions restrictions, have forced it to cut H20 prices by \"over 10 percent\" in the Chinese market. One of the companies noted in the original story that still supports Nvidia in China is the online marketplace Alibaba, which ordered over 30,000 Nvidia H20 chips. Distributors are selling the H20 at roughly 100,000 yuan, compared to the Huawei 910B, which can exceed 120,000 yuan per card.SemiAnalysis founder Dylan Patel adds that the H20 costs \"more than an H100 to manufacture due to its higher memory capacity\" despite being sold for half the price, which he correctly points out as a \"dramatic decrease in margin.\"Besides dealing with sanctions and the resulting thin margins, Nvidia has to deal with Beijing encouraging Chinese companies to buy from Huawei first. With this information in mind, Huawei is expected to \"dramatically increase\" its Ascend 910B shipments.Nvidia CFO Colette Kress notes that \"Our data centre revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to\" the new sanctions applied, and that they \"expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.\"On a happier-for-Nvidia note, Chinese news site MyDrivers, citing Bobantang, claims the supply of RTX gaming GPUs to China has increased by at least 30% since May. These are obviously more consumer-oriented than the AI chips, but of course, Nvidia GPUs are perfectly adequate AI accelerators for most users and small businesses.Unfortunately for Nvidia, the big money is clearly in the AI server and datacenter space, and world politics have brutally kicked them off that Top Dog Throne in China. Even if the Nvidia H20 outperformed the Huawei 910B, the aforementioned manufacturing cost issues and thinner margins would still make it a slightly pyrrhic victory.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee all comments (1)\n\n\n\nChristopher HarperSocial Links NavigationContributing WriterChristopher Harper has been a successful freelance tech writer specializing in PC hardware and gaming since 2015, and ghostwrote\u00a0for various B2B clients in High School before that.

Its stock\u2019s rally comes after the company reported blowout quarterly earnings Wednesday afternoon, highlighted by a more than 600% annual increase in profits. The third-most valuable company in the world, Nvidia added $220 billion in market value on Thursday, growing to a $2.6 trillion market capitalization, a sum larger than the combined valuations of Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase and Tesla. Nvidia has handsomely rewarded long-term shareholders like Nvidia, with shares returning 21,500% over the last decade, 2,500% over the last five years and 115% this year alone. Even after the valuation spike, Nvidia\u2019s growth story \u201cis clearly nowhere near its end, and likely nowhere near its peak,\u201d according to Bernstein analysts led by Stacy Rasgon.\n\nBig Number\n$8.7 million. That\u2019s how much Huang will receive in quarterly dividend payments next month after Nvidia upped its dividend payout by 150% to $0.10 per share before the stock split. That\u2019s chump change compared to the roughly $175 million in quarterly dividends paid out to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cThe Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another masterpiece quarter,\u201d gushed Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a note to clients, serving among a chorus of reverential Wall Street analysts toward Huang and Nvidia.\n\nFurther ReadingForbesNvidia Earnings: Stock Rallies As AI Giant Reports 600% Profit Explosion, 10-For-1 Stock SplitBy Derek Saul\n\nForbesNvidia Shares Soar After Stellar Earnings-Along With Chip StocksBy Robert Hart\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Derek SaulFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationComments\u00a0One Community.

Net profit was $14.88bn, up from $2bn a year before.The AI chip maker, whose fortunes are interpreted as a bellwether for the AI transformation under way, reported earnings per share were $5.98, up 21% from the previous quarter and up 629% from a year ago. Investors had expected revenue of $24.65bn and earnings per share of $5.59, according to CNBC. The company also announced it would split its stock, currently trading at $962, 10-for-one on 7 June.Investors had been anticipating another blockbuster set of financial results, but they also wanted to see that spending by big tech on Nvidia\u2019s chips was as impressive as they anticipated. And it was.\u201cNvidia defies gravity again as AI companies globally continue to depend on its chips, networking hardware and its software ecosystem,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.Bourne said the tech giants\u2019 public praise of Nvidia was \u201ca telltale sign of its dominance\u201d, and that they want to reduce their dependence on the company \u201cbut realize they\u2019re not quite there yet\u201d.Tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have all signaled they plan to spend $200bn this year on chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. Apple has said it will announce its AI strategy next month. Nvidia is seen as the leading provider of chips best-suited to powering AI.The company has gained more than $1.1tn in value this year alone. At the end of 2022, Nvidia was worth $359bn. Now, halfway through 2024, it\u2019s worth $2.33tn. That\u2019s only $500bn less than Apple and $900bn less than Microsoft, the two most valuable companies based in the US.The chipmaker\u2019s earnings announcement \u201chas become one of the most important events on the macro calendar\u201d, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Henry Allen.Analysts are warning that no stock goes in a straight line up forever. Nvidia\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at a massive 79.95-to-one. For contrast, Microsoft is at 36, and Apple 29. But Nvidia is also making nearly $0.50 on every dollar in sales in bottom-line net income.Can it keep up with demand? Nvidia\u2019s chips are now so hotly desired they\u2019re delivered by armored car. On Tuesday, its stock dropped 5% after Amazon, a major customer, told the Financial Times it was waiting on orders for Nvidia\u2019s new superchip, Blackwell.There\u2019s also the question of China. In line with the Biden administration\u2019s crackdown on Chinese-made electric vehicles, the administration has denied the company from selling its highest-end semiconductors in China.Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities says that investors will be listening closely to AI \u201cgodfather\u201d Jensen when he speaks after the results are reported. \u201cThe AI revolution starts with Nvidia, and in our view, the AI party is just getting started with the popcorn getting ready,\u201d he says.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)Quarterly resultsNvidianewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS politicsUKClimate crisisMiddle EastUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us\u00a0Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top\u00a9 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.

(AP ... [+] Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved\nNvidia stock shares surged more than 10% following the company's latest earnings report, which exceeded investor expectations and demonstrated the ongoing high demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Notably, the company's data center revenue soared by an impressive 427% during Q1 of fiscal year 2025, which ended on April 28.\n\n\nWhile Nvidia benefits from the exponential growth in AI, other areas of the economy associated with the boom \u2014 such as certain commodities and electric utilities \u2014 are struggling to keep pace with the expansion.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's graphic processing units is driven by the major cloud services providers \u2014Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. According to Nvidia, these clients accounted for approximately 45% of Nvidia's $22.56 billion in data center sales in Q1 of FY 2025. \"The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible \u2014 we're racing every single day,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a call with investors following the earnings release.\n\n\nThese cloud services giants are in an AI arms race, investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new data centers. According to an analysis from JP Morgan made available to institutional clients in February, global data center annual capital expenditure is expected to rise from around $300 billion in 2024 to more than $500 billion by 2027.\n\nData centers are electricity hogs, and the availability of power is a major bottleneck to their global expansion. Aging and inefficient electrical grids are not able to scale to keep up with demand. The rapid growth of data centers coincides with the increased adoption of electric vehicles, driving power demand far beyond expectations.\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024By Kevin Payne, ContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024By Cassidy Horton, Contributor\n\nElectricity consumption from data centers and artificial intelligence could double by 2026, according to a report from the International Energy Agency. The IEA predicts that \u201cafter globally consuming an estimated 460 terawatt-hours in 2022, electricity consumption from data centers could reach more than 1,000 TWh in 2026.\u201d This doubling of demand is roughly equivalent to the entire electricity consumption of some industrialized countries, such as Japan.\n\nExisting U.S. electrical utility companies are expected to step up. Nine of the top 10 said data centers were a primary source of customer growth, leading many of them to increase their forecasts for capital expenditure plans and demand, according to a Reuters analysis of Q1 earnings reports. Yet many of these companies require infrastructure investments to materially increase their output.\n\n\nThe growth of the grid means that utilities and their customers are scrambling to purchase all types of electrical equipment. One company benefiting from utility company investment spending is Eaton. According to the company's website, it aims to \"future-proof infrastructure, optimize distributed generation, automate processes and reduce risk.\" Eaton stock has responded to the expansion of the grid. Its stock is up 42% so far this year.Nvidia has soared 115% YTD. AI demand has also helped stocks and commodities that benefit from ... [+] growth in data centers that power AI.Garth Friesen; Bloomberg LP\nA larger electrical grid also means more demand for natural gas to power the utilities. According to Goldman Sachs\nGoldman Sachs\n' report published in April, natural gas is expected to supply 60% of the power demand growth from AI and data centers, while renewables will provide the remaining 40%. Fortunately, the U.S. is blessed with plenty of domestic natural gas to feed the anticipated increase in demand.\nHowever, some critical metals needed in the build out are harder to source. The exponential growth of AI computing capacity in the coming decade has a direct impact on the amount of copper required to support this growth. According to a Man Institute report, \u201cthe potential incremental copper demand from the U.S. data center buildout could range between 0.5% and 1.5% of global copper demand. Although this might seem insignificant, even a 1% shortage could plunge the market into a significant deficit.\u201d\nThe copper market is responding to the anticipated imbalance between supply and demand. Copper prices have soared 22% in the last three months. Similar to the situation with the electrical grid, additional supply is not poised to meet demand. Aging mines, lack of exploration success, environmental and water issues, and heightened political risk in key producing regions are challenging supply.\nMore AI demand means more need for data centers, which in turn means more need for electricity. More electricity means greater demand for copper and natural gas. Certain commodities and utilities are riding the wave of the AI boom, along with Nvidia. Nvidia's earnings suggest AI growth remains robust, and the stress on the infrastructure to support that growth will only increase.\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter or LinkedIn.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.Editorial StandardsForbes AccoladesLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES\u2019 FEATURED Video\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.  What if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today? Nvidia's Business In-Depth With that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers. NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company\u2019s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company\u2019s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments \u2013 Graphics and Compute & Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Compute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.Graphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.   Story Continues Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $230,327.74, or a gain of 22,932.77%, as of May 27, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&P 500 rose 179.12% and the price of gold increased 77.20% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.NVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over the past year. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.Shares have gained 21.35% over the past four weeks and there have been 6 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
